1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,560
yarden chef here telling us about intel

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,720
cet and how to stop being scared of

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,080
french baking so we had some french

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,400
cooking now we're moving on to french

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,880
baking

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,839
thank you um yeah that is that was a

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:16,640
really good

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,199
order for the talks because french

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,960
baking is pretty different from french

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,920
cooking

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,560
um i'm going to talk about that and just

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,599
share my slides

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,160
so we're going to talk about two very

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,320
different things uh intel ct which is a

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,600
new security feature

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,840
on uh the recent uh intel processors

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,960
that are out for since the last few

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,760
months

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,719
and then we're going to talk about

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,600
french baking and

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,760
how to take something that seems really

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,719
complicated and

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,800
sound real and sounds really complicated

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,760
and make it

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,559
really really easy and creative and fun

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,960
and make people think like you put way

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,559
more effort into your baking than you

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,038
actually did

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,920
we'll start with intel ct

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
um first yeah who i am my name is joden

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,520
i'm a software engineer at crowdstrike

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,560
and i teach

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,520
windows internals classes mostly

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,320
together without

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,000
nesco and conferences and stuff

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,119
i used to be a pastry chef and now i'm a

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,520
hobbyist and pre-covered i also used to

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,520
be a circus artist and hopefully

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,320
will be again

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,960
um so we'll start with the security

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,159
related uh

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,280
topic which is intel ct that's a that's

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,439
a processor feature that

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,880
intel added into their newest

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,399
tiger lake processors which is meant

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,799
completely for security purposes

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,079
because there is a very common

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,439
uh relatively well well-known

49
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,079
exploitation technique called rock

50
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,399
return-oriented programming which is a

51
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,719
method to

52
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,360
um to hijack the execution of

53
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,520
application if you can of an application

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,399
of

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,520
process if you can't allocate and run

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,200
your own code in it

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,720
it basically uses existing instructions

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,120
in the process to create a

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,400
to create your own shell code without

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,480
allocating writing one um

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,640
there are a few different ways of doing

62
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,319
that rock is one of them

63
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,599
by overriding a return address because

64
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,920
when you when a call instruction happens

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,599
a return address is being pushed into a

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,319
stack

67
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,720
so if you as an attacker have control of

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
the stack through stack corruption

69
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,000
or anything similar to that you can

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,519
override the return address

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,480
and get the and when the function

72
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,840
returns it will

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,720
jump to whichever address you put there

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,480
which once you can control

75
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,760
you can use your stacker option to build

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,000
your own shell code

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
other ways are for example overriding

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
a function pointer in a function table

79
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,440
so

80
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,080
a call instruction will call the address

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,080
you put in there instead of the address

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
that's originally there um that's

83
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,159
something that's handled by

84
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,200
um through mostly through software with

85
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,920
cfg

86
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,280
or the newer xfg but uh

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,319
rop is something that cannot be handled

88
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,400
through software microsoft did try to do

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,280
that

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,120
it didn't really work so they

91
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,200
got rid of that was called rfg for a

92
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,360
while

93
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,120
but now we can have a hardware based

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,400
solution for that

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,560
um and because it's a hardware-based

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
solution it's not

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,720
as vulnerable to race conditions or to

98
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,159
other things that software-based

99
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,799
solutions

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,560
have the way it works

101
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,080
is it adds a second stack

102
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,920
there is the normal thread stack where

103
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,360
arguments go where return addresses go

104
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
the one that the thread uses when it

105
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,400
runs

106
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,280
but ct adds a second thing called a

107
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,320
shadow stack

108
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,120
that's a stack that the process or

109
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,880
thread itself is not supposed to be

110
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,519
using

111
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,000
and the only thing it has is return

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,960
addresses

113
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,040
whenever a call instruction happens the

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,240
return address

115
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,440
gets pushed into the normal thread stack

116
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,680
but it also gets pushed by the processor

117
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,479
into the shadow stack

118
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,400
and a shadow stack is protected memory

119
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,520
thread doesn't know where it is it's

120
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,639
not writable it's not modifiable

121
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,759
you can't tamper with it you can't um

122
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,160
corrupt it the same way you can corrupt

123
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,639
the normal stack

124
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,280
and then when the function returns it

125
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,800
reads the

126
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,639
ad it reads return address from normal

127
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,960
stack but the processor also reads the

128
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,199
return address from the shadow stack

129
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,840
and it comes and it compares them and if

130
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,080
it's not the same return address there

131
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,520
will be an exception

132
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,840
and the process could crash that depends

133
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,000
on the operating system

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,280
but generally ct can be used it does

135
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,120
implement a few other things not

136
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,080
only a shadow stack not only um rock

137
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,199
mitigation

138
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,240
it also allows for um

139
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,160
forward edge mitigations and a couple

140
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,680
other stuff but right now

141
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,520
operating systems don't implement that

142
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,440
the only thing that

143
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,600
the main thing that it's used for is as

144
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,919
mitigation to rock

145
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,360
and because i like diagrams um

146
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,039
we'll see here that what i'm going to

147
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,479
show now is a normal flow

148
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,520
we have a call instruction and the

149
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,160
return address is being pushed into both

150
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,720
stacks

151
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,039
it is the same return address uh now we

152
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,000
can imagine

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,479
the function running all sorts of things

154
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,120
happen

155
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,240
and then the function returns with a red

156
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,800
instruction now the red instruction

157
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,440
reads

158
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,919
the return address from both of the

159
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:08,800
stacks

160
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,280
compares them in this case they are both

161
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,160
the same

162
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,039
so we jump to the address and we keep

163
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,080
running

164
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,520
as expected what happens if

165
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,120
there's an exploit that corrupts the

166
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,479
stack is a call instruction happened

167
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,360
pushed both return addresses but while

168
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,520
the function is running

169
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,160
this exploit comes in and corrupts the

170
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,039
stack

171
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,759
this is a relatively simplified version

172
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,479
usually

173
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,319
you wouldn't just corrupt the return

174
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,680
address you usually

175
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,600
corrupt a lot more of the stack to for

176
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,720
example corrupt

177
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,759
multiple return addresses or control

178
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,039
variables or

179
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,720
have some more things but in this case

180
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,120
you just corrupt the return address

181
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,360
and now when the function returns if we

182
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,400
didn't have

183
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,440
cet it would just jump into the fake

184
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,880
return address

185
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,400
given our exploit code execution

186
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,400
by this case it reads both addresses

187
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,840
so they're not the same and it throws an

188
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,318
exception

189
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,400
now for an exception doesn't necessarily

190
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
mean that the process

191
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,360
is going to crash an exception is

192
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
just something the processor throws and

193
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,199
has absolutely no idea what's going to

194
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,560
happen to it

195
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,880
um and the operating system is supposed

196
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,199
to catch those exceptions and decide

197
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,560
what to do with them

198
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,280
system doesn't necessarily crash on

199
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,560
every exception there are a lot of

200
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,759
different types of exceptions

201
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,639
and you can even use for most exceptions

202
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,879
or for some of them you can even use a

203
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,759
try cat or try except depending on what

204
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,840
language you're writing in

205
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,800
to ignore your exceptions yourselves in

206
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,639
our case the operating system

207
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,639
needs to catch that exception and

208
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,400
what windows chooses to do is what it

209
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,039
does with a lot of different mitigation

210
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,479
it has uh several options

211
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,120
it can choose to crash the process

212
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,039
because

213
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,240
if we got a ct exception something bad

214
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,680
probably happened

215
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,800
on exploit overrode or step

216
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,720
we don't really know how to recover from

217
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,919
that

218
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,800
and that will crash the process but

219
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,000
that's a very

220
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,039
uh simplistic view of it um and for

221
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,639
anyone who's been in security for more

222
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,919
than a few years

223
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,200
i have had more than enough cases of

224
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
saying oh this is definitely what's

225
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,958
going to happen this is definitely a

226
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,559
malicious thing

227
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,200
we want to detect that always and then

228
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,440
you ship your product it runs on

229
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,839
exactly three customer machines and then

230
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,360
you get an angry phone call from a

231
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,880
customer saying

232
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,200
no our um our it has a script that does

233
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,399
exactly that

234
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,880
we we're injecting code into elsa on

235
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,720
purpose

236
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,040
we we wanted we want to do that why why

237
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,240
are you blocking our

238
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,360
powershell script so you can't really

239
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,000
crash every

240
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,800
process that has a ct violation um

241
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,880
because microsoft is a big believer

242
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,560
in backward compatibility and

243
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,959
there are a lot of things that actually

244
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,560
use rock as a

245
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,839
semi-legitimate technique some

246
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,000
security products use it as part of

247
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,160
their code injection

248
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,320
because code injection is messy even

249
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,640
some microsoft products have

250
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,760
built-in drop for all sorts of different

251
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,000
reasons so you can't just enable that

252
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,760
mitigation crash everything because it

253
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,360
will start crashing

254
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,839
a whole lot of things that use it as a

255
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:44,640
feature

256
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,279
and you don't actually want to start

257
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,839
crashing everything

258
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,240
so this has um

259
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,440
windows added um compilation flag like

260
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,079
like

261
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,120
it does with most mitigations uh this

262
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,160
compilation flag is slash ced compact

263
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,839
meaning ct compatible and

264
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,040
what it actually means is hey i am

265
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,320
building this application

266
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,120
knowing that it is compatible with ct i

267
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,040
know that my application

268
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,000
is not using drop as a feature there is

269
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,120
no reason

270
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,360
you will see this application dropping

271
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,560
anything

272
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,920
and if you do i want it to crash because

273
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,600
this is not supposed to happen so

274
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,920
something bad happened

275
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,839
so when you build your new applications

276
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,240
please do build them with

277
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,600
ct compat and

278
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
if you can't do that because your

279
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,120
application uses rock as a feature

280
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,760
i recommend to stop using that before

281
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,440
microsoft start enforcing this

282
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,480
in i don't know 10 years or so so we've

283
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,560
got some time

284
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,000
um so windows will for not only crash

285
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,720
applications running with built with ct

286
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,560
compact because otherwise you

287
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,720
can't really know but what it will do

288
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,480
is if your application is not built with

289
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,560
ct compact of course that all

290
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,360
only happens if you're running with a ct

291
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,160
compatible

292
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,120
processor and operating systems which

293
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,880
none of you probably do because it's

294
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,839
only been shipped like two months ago

295
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,920
um but if you're running with ct

296
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,760
compatible processor and operating

297
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,720
system

298
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,760
and your application

299
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,240
dropped but it is not built with ct

300
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,839
compat

301
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,720
windows won't completely ignore it but

302
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,600
it won't cross

303
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,279
it won't crash your process either

304
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,279
instead it's going to log that

305
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,279
into the windows event viewer

306
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,959
ah through an w event yeah this is what

307
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,040
it looks like for anyone not familiar

308
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,079
with the

309
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,880
windows event viewer it's very useful

310
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,680
for

311
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,800
um forensics for finding out what's

312
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,839
happening in the machine

313
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,639
what happened what could have caused a

314
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,200
crash

315
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,480
or security risk and

316
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,680
it has a few different channels uh ct

317
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,560
errors

318
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,200
uh errors and warnings um warnings

319
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
meaning the process did not crash errors

320
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,560
mean it did

321
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,000
so they're both logged into a

322
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
place called microsoft windows security

323
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,399
mitigations that has user mode in kernel

324
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,079
mode and ct goes into kernel mode

325
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,240
so in this case what we're seeing here

326
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,000
is an application

327
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,760
um some random application that was

328
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,519
running on my machine

329
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,839
that is not built as ct compatible

330
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,760
but did have a ct violation which is

331
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,720
um it would have been blocked from

332
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,600
setting context now that doesn't mean

333
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,440
it dropped it doesn't mean the return

334
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,120
addresses didn't match

335
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,880
i'll talk about what this warning means

336
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
in a minute but it would have been

337
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,240
blocked

338
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,600
but it didn't because it's not built as

339
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,320
ct compatible so we don't know that

340
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,000
is using the same assumptions we do

341
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
and obviously in this case it isn't

342
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,519
because this

343
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,360
was not an exploit this is just a

344
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
completely legitimate application

345
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,079
that does something that windows doesn't

346
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,120
currently agree with

347
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,120
second case is an application that

348
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,320
did um that was built with

349
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,880
ct compatibility part of vs code

350
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,519
and it has encountered a shadow stack

351
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,240
return address mismatch

352
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,480
and you can see here the process will be

353
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,079
terminated

354
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,160
so that's what happens if windows

355
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,120
decides that

356
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,680
no we really do want to crash this

357
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,519
application we're not okay with what's

358
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,720
happening here

359
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,120
we don't think this is a legitimate case

360
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,680
that's just like incompatible we really

361
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,880
do want to crash it

362
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,680
and this is a classic ct crash uh

363
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,279
because of a shadow stack

364
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,920
uh return address mismatch meaning the

365
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,600
address on the regular stack and the

366
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,440
address on the shadow stack are not the

367
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,680
same

368
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,360
but i want to go back to the previous

369
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,000
case for a second because here we don't

370
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,480
see

371
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,959
a return address mismatch we see would

372
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,000
have been blocked from

373
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
setting context because microsoft said

374
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,839
well if we have that shadow stack

375
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,480
and we have that capability there are a

376
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,600
lot of different

377
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,720
ways of hijacking the execution

378
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,360
of a process yes you can overwrite

379
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,760
function pointer which cfg handles

380
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,320
you can overwrite a return address which

381
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,519
is

382
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,720
you know the basic usage of ct but you

383
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,199
can also do things like

384
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,600
uh calling set thread context which lets

385
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,720
you

386
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,279
set the values for all the

387
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,399
for all the registers of a thread for

388
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,279
example

389
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,920
it's a stack pointer or it's instruction

390
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,320
pointer when you control those

391
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,399
you can control what the thread is going

392
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,600
to do you can tell it

393
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
what code it's going to run what part of

394
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,079
the stack it's going to call

395
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,079
another way is through exception

396
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,600
handling

397
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,759
because when an exception is thrown

398
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,600
inside of a process

399
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,320
it goes into a process exception handler

400
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,040
so

401
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,880
if you can control the address of the

402
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,680
exception handler and give it a fake one

403
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,360
while you control what the process is

404
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,040
running so

405
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,600
windows added a few more ct related

406
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,839
checks um for set thread context for

407
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,120
exception handling

408
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,320
um for uh unwinding

409
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,360
so i'm going to continue and it's a

410
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,160
it's a pretty complicated mechanism all

411
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,959
implemented inside the windows kernel

412
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,920
but if you have a ct compatible

413
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,600
processor if you're one of the

414
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,720
five lucky people who have a matching

415
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,480
computer yet

416
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
then you can open your event viewer you

417
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,079
can see all those warnings even if you

418
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,680
did not enable ct

419
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,959
for your um

420
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,800
for your applications all you need to do

421
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,480
is to set

422
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,399
ct to basic mode through the registry

423
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,480
and then you will get all those warnings

424
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,079
and you will see

425
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,920
uh what would have been blocked what

426
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,519
would have been terminated

427
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,240
what is acting funny and you'll see

428
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,279
quite a lot of

429
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,519
microsoft applications there because.net

430
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,839
is not yet supported

431
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,839
for ct um so for example powershell

432
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,440
is incompatible with ct visual studio a

433
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,240
whole lot of things for now

434
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,800
and you'll see some interesting things

435
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,559
things with event viewer

436
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,000
menu uses um pw so everything you see in

437
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,520
event view you can also get

438
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,480
through um etw events so if you have a

439
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,160
security product that wants to take

440
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
advantage of ct

441
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,599
you can register for the etw channels

442
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,240
get all the ct warnings and

443
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,199
try to decide for yourselves if it's uh

444
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,400
if it's just

445
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,520
an old incompatible application or if

446
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:29,919
it's

447
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,120
a malicious or if it's a piece of

448
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,200
malicious code trying to

449
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:47,600
take over a legitimate app

450
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,080
like the last thing i'm gonna say about

451
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,120
ct

452
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,039
is that uh all i've been talking about

453
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,760
for now is user mode ct

454
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,720
for user mode applications um because

455
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,080
that's what's been shipped

456
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,960
for now on windows there are plans for

457
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,120
kernel mode ct which will probably

458
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,160
be shipped sometime towards the end of

459
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,240
the year or early next year depending on

460
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,840
microsoft schedule

461
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,120
um but for now it's only

462
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,320
it's only relevant for user

463
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,400
modifications

464
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,360
um i can talk about cp for like another

465
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,160
two hours

466
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,600
uh alex messi and i wrote uh

467
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,880
i don't know 7 000 word paper on it

468
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,400
which only covers part of it

469
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,960
but i only have 20 minutes for this part

470
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,799
so we'll move on to the

471
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,679
non-infosec thing which i can talk way

472
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,039
more about

473
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,240
just cookies like i said i used to be a

474
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,120
pastry chef

475
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,640
i studied uh french patissoe for a while

476
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,720
i worked in it for a little bit

477
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,160
and then i decided to just make it into

478
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,200
a hobby and

479
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,960
as a hobby it's actually way more fun

480
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,360
because you get to experiment you get to

481
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,000
do

482
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,480
all sorts of fun things you get to

483
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,840
discover

484
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,360
what you can and can't do

485
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,640
and unlike french or

486
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,559
like french cooking or any kind of

487
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,160
cooking actually

488
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,240
um baking to me is a lot more of a

489
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,200
science

490
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,440
that doesn't mean that it's not creative

491
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,360
and fine experimental

492
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,400
but it is very much a science and i

493
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,480
actually love that because once you

494
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,000
learn the science you learn

495
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,840
what is set in stone and what you can

496
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,080
play with and change and in what ways

497
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,840
and you get to do all sorts of really

498
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,760
really really cool things

499
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,640
and this part i'll talk about one very

500
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,440
basic

501
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,720
um part of french sewing

502
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,320
use butter cookies those little round

503
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,559
butter flavored cookies that are always

504
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,919
covered in sugar

505
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,360
and made out of pretty much butter and

506
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
flour

507
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,559
they're very very very simple

508
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,880
they're easy to make every coffee shop

509
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
has them

510
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,760
and they're awesome and they're one of

511
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,840
my favorite things to make

512
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
and the reason they're one of my

513
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,159
favorite things to make is

514
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,640
as simple as they are you can do

515
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
a million different versions of them you

516
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,480
can make them into different flavors you

517
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,159
can add different things to them

518
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,159
but you can make them different colors

519
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,799
um with no food coloring

520
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,679
and when you have people coming over in

521
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,000
two

522
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
hours and you've got nothing at home and

523
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,159
you completely forgot to make something

524
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,559
but you still want to do something cool

525
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,919
you can use one

526
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,799
one mixer bowl make four different kinds

527
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,480
of butter cookies that all

528
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,400
look and taste completely different and

529
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
seem like you made a huge effort and

530
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,080
started making things two days in

531
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,600
advance like you're such a

532
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,039
cool baker when you use one dish in one

533
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,840
recipe

534
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,000
so there are two principles

535
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,960
to making butter cookies once you have

536
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,000
those two

537
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,559
you can do anything with them the first

538
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,159
one is the ratio

539
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,039
of ingredients the only two ingredients

540
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:19,919
that matter

541
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,120
in butter cookies are butter and flour

542
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,320
the sugar is only there for flavor

543
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,520
egg is helpful to keep things together a

544
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,919
little bit but it's not necessary

545
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,960
um salt cocoa

546
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,919
powder vanilla all of that is just for

547
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,200
flavor the only two

548
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,720
ingredients of matter are butter and

549
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,320
flour

550
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,360
and for butter cookies to work you need

551
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,120
to use a ratio of at least

552
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,600
one to two meaning the weight of butter

553
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,000
has to be at least 50 percent

554
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,679
the weight of flour um

555
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,440
if you're if you're going to use 100

556
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
grams of flour you should use at least

557
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,120
50 grams of butter

558
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,200
that's the bare minimum you can go as

559
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,600
high as one to one if you'd like

560
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,840
i like using two to three um

561
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,080
i mean for a hundred grams of flour i

562
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,840
would use

563
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,039
around 65-70 grams of butter

564
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,960
that's individual it also depends on

565
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,799
exactly what butter and what flour

566
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,840
you're using

567
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,760
which do change a bit between brands and

568
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
between countries

569
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,720
when they say butter i mean butter that

570
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,960
has at least 82 percent fat

571
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,000
a lot of the common butter you'll find

572
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,120
in supermarkets

573
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,320
is sort of fake butter it has 80

574
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,080
fat i've seen as low as 75 which

575
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,200
i don't think is even legally allowed to

576
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,960
be called butter in france

577
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,280
um so you should look at that the more

578
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,679
fat percentage do you have

579
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,480
the more buttery flavor you're gonna

580
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:54,880
have

581
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,760
and also you can keep to the original

582
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,679
ratio if your butter percentage goes

583
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,799
lower it will change things up a bit

584
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,000
but the cool thing is when you

585
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,880
understand that understand that butter

586
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,000
is simply 82 fat and around 80

587
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,039
liquid and a barrel

588
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,200
and an amount of a really really really

589
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,799
small amount of protein

590
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,360
and some other stuff you don't

591
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,799
necessarily have to use

592
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,480
butter you can replace it with other

593
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,799
things now for butter cookies to be

594
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,520
successful

595
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,280
you need fat that is um

596
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,320
that is not liquid you need

597
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,520
you need a kind of oil or fat

598
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,520
that is a solid in room temperature

599
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,480
so you can't use olive oil you can't use

600
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,880
canola oil because they're liquid

601
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,919
but if you don't want to use a dairy

602
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,720
for whatever reason like i'm jewish my

603
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,480
family is religious we can't have

604
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,919
dairy after um after meat

605
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,440
so when i need to make desserts for my

606
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,279
family i can't use butter

607
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,039
for meaty dinners so you can replace

608
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,000
that with things like

609
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,360
coconut oil coconut oil is solid in room

610
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,880
temperature

611
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,279
so you can replace the fat part of

612
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,279
butter with coconut oil and the liquid

613
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,880
with

614
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,440
water milk coconut milk

615
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,919
orange juice coffee your favorite

616
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:22,960
bourbon

617
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,880
anything elegant flour

618
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,120
is white wheat flour but you can

619
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,360
experiment and replace it with any other

620
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,240
kind of flour

621
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,760
like gluten-free flour if you're

622
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,200
if you don't eat gluten this is the only

623
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,760
thing that

624
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,720
matters you wanna put those two things

625
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,120
your

626
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,480
butter or different fat and flour into a

627
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,720
mixer food processor process them

628
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,240
together and get dough

629
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,919
it's not going to be especially tasty

630
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,200
though because it's not going to have

631
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,240
much of a flavor

632
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,679
you don't have sugar in it you don't

633
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,000
have anything else but it is going to be

634
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,760
dough

635
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,600
then usually to keep it together a

636
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,520
little bit better you want to add

637
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,799
a bit of either either fat or

638
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,760
liquid um it's going to be an egg yolk

639
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,640
um

640
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,120
a bit of milk a bit of water really tiny

641
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,679
amount

642
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,559
but that's all you need for the dough

643
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,080
now the second thing

644
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,039
is you don't want just any dough you

645
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,279
want that

646
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,520
unique texture that butter cookies have

647
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,440
and that texture is kind of crumbly it

648
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,919
crumbles everywhere it breaks when you

649
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,039
take a bite out of

650
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,320
it if you compare it for example with

651
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,960
bread bread doesn't do that bread is a

652
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,159
lot more

653
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,360
the dough is more elastic the dough of

654
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,039
bread is a lot more chewy

655
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,760
you don't want to have the same texture

656
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,400
as bread

657
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,120
in your butter cookies but they're both

658
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,880
pretty much made of you know similar

659
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,400
ingredients

660
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,360
so here the difference is how you

661
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,000
process

662
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,440
it because that plastic

663
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,240
chewy texture that we get in bread that

664
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,640
comes from gluten

665
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,679
and gluten

666
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,960
when when we talk about

667
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,000
gluten people think you know people

668
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,520
talk about um flour having gluten

669
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,559
that's true but that's not

670
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,120
really accurate flour has the potential

671
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,080
for gluten

672
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,360
what flour does have is two

673
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,200
um is two other proteins

674
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,240
called gliadin and glutenine

675
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,960
which when they meet in the presence of

676
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,360
water

677
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,400
they turn into gluten gluten is what

678
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
gives us this elastic

679
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,679
stretchy chewy texture which we love in

680
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,640
bread

681
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,640
but we don't love in butter cookies

682
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,600
and the the way to create gluten is to

683
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,480
take flour add water to it and just

684
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,279
process it

685
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,760
mix it knead it for as long as possible

686
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,720
to make sure those two proteins will

687
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,159
meet

688
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,840
will have the largest potential of

689
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,080
meeting and creating gluten and

690
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,360
creating sort of a net that traps

691
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,240
water and air inside the dough now

692
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,600
because we don't want diet butter

693
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,039
cookies what we want to do

694
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,840
is to process the dough as little as

695
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,200
possible

696
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,679
so the potential for creating gluten

697
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,640
will be

698
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,880
as low as possible of course it will

699
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,200
still create gluten

700
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,520
um because that just happens but we'll

701
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,840
have less of it than we have in bread so

702
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,640
you want to

703
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,679
give it as little time as possible

704
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,720
to create so we can have that crumbly

705
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,120
texture

706
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,480
now the other thing is that

707
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,679
one more way to prevent bloom from being

708
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,480
created

709
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,559
is with oil when you add oil into

710
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,840
the flour and water mixture

711
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,880
the fat wraps around the

712
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,399
wraps around those two proteins and

713
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,440
kind of it doesn't really stop them

714
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,039
from combine but it makes the frost a

715
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,039
lot slower

716
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,399
so when we add a whole lot of oil and

717
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,480
fat in the form of butter

718
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,520
into our flour then we'll we'll get less

719
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,000
glued

720
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
it also means if you're trying to make

721
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,600
bread and

722
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,000
you're making for example a brioche you

723
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,600
would want to add the butter

724
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,000
a lot later so you could first create

725
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,039
all your gluten

726
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,320
and then add butter so you don't prevent

727
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,520
it from being created

728
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,720
but in our case it's actually good

729
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,640
because we don't want a lot of gluten

730
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,279
in our dough

731
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,279
so that's part of what makes butter

732
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,679
cookies awesome by design

733
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,000
you need to work them really really

734
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,279
really little

735
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,679
you want to throw all your ingredients

736
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,279
into food processor

737
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,159
work it just until you get a something

738
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,840
that can barely pass as a ball of

739
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,440
add that little bit of oil or liquid

740
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,480
to to make it stick together

741
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,840
and then wrap it in nylon or

742
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,320
whatever and put it in the fridge um

743
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,120
or the freezer it doesn't matter too

744
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,840
much

745
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
but if you want to make it immediately

746
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,320
you'd want to wrap it and put it in the

747
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,600
fridge too for example um

748
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
roll it make all these shapes with your

749
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,240
cookie cutters which is awesome

750
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,360
um the industrial way to do that which

751
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,919
is

752
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,720
also the lazy person's way and my way is

753
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,360
to

754
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,120
make it into a roll wrap it in nylon

755
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,200
stick it in the freezer and then once

756
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,360
you want to bake it you take your frozen

757
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,559
roll of cookie dough you cut it into

758
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,360
cookie shapes and you bake it it's

759
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,559
really really really easy

760
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,679
you only get one shape this way a little

761
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,880
round um little circles um

762
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,399
if you're feeling creative you can try

763
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,799
to make your roll shaped like a square

764
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,080
or triangle

765
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,919
and then you get square triangle cookies

766
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,159
but that's about it you get one shape

767
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,760
but it's really easy

768
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,039
and really really really not messy

769
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,559
so that's for a science part you put

770
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,200
everything together right ratios

771
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,440
process it as little as possible and

772
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,559
stick it in the

773
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,399
fridge or freezer until you want to bake

774
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,799
it it's easy enough

775
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,279
but this way you only get one kind of

776
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,919
cookie and we didn't even talk about

777
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,399
sugar or anything that gives it gives it

778
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,480
natural flavor here's

779
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,840
the coolest thing because these

780
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,000
two principles are all you need to get

781
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
successful cookies

782
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,960
you can do pretty much anything to give

783
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,760
it flavor

784
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,679
you can add a little bit of sugar to get

785
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,600
those standard

786
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,879
light butter cookies

787
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,720
you can do anything else as long as you

788
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,919
know what kind of material you're using

789
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,120
if you're using something that is dry

790
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,840
and close to flour like cocoa powder or

791
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,360
um almond flour or hazelnut flour or

792
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,200
anything that is kind of

793
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,159
powdery all i need to do is replace a

794
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,840
little bit of the flour with it usually

795
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,519
10 to 15

796
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,240
if you put in cocoa powder replace 10 to

797
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,880
15

798
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,960
of the flour with cocoa powder and you

799
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,720
have chocolate cookies

800
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,240
if you want to add anything that is

801
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,840
liquid like coffee

802
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,360
or um mashed

803
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,720
strawberries fruit or counted as liquid

804
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,080
whatever you do with them they count as

805
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,159
liquid or

806
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,000
some kind of alcohol you want to add a

807
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,360
little bit of

808
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,840
whiskey to your cookies you want to add

809
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,080
some orange juice

810
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,320
that counts as liquid you add that

811
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,120
instead of

812
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,120
whatever liquid you're using if that's

813
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,760
milk or egg whites just replace it

814
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,320
if you want to add something that is fat

815
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,640
that is fat based like kind of

816
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,000
like some kind of nut butter um almond

817
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,240
butter or peanut butter or pistachio

818
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,799
butter

819
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,399
or um that's all

820
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,840
100 fat just replace a little bit of

821
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,519
your butter with that

822
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,200
and you'll get that flavor and you'll

823
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,440
also get that really nice color

824
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,919
one of the things i like to do to get

825
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,600
super colorful cookies

826
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,279
is makes is make some of them um

827
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,960
with pistachio butter that has like this

828
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,840
really nice

829
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,240
green to it or replacing the liquid

830
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,840
with um raspberry extract

831
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,640
not extra raspberry juice and then it

832
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,480
makes it pink

833
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,880
um you can add lemon zest or orange zest

834
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,640
or anything or vanilla extract

835
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,760
um you can replace the sugar with maple

836
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,200
syrup

837
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,039
because it's still sugar it counts as

838
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,440
sugar just replace with maple syrup and

839
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,679
you'll have like this maple

840
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,960
flavor to your cookies and you can also

841
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,440
add

842
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,640
um solid solid additions

843
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,279
like chocolate chips like chopped nuts

844
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:31,679
like

845
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,279
um raisins um

846
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,960
if you add those you just want to add

847
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,480
add those at the end

848
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,279
so they don't tear apart the dough just

849
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,679
add them at the end just mix them in

850
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,760
and they're there you don't need to

851
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,880
replace anything with them

852
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,960
now when you understand that talk about

853
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,399
the fact that they don't even have to be

854
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,679
sweet cookies

855
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,320
because butter and flour is very neutral

856
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,159
the the sugar doesn't

857
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,000
do anything other than flavor so we

858
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,519
don't have to make them sweet cookies

859
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,000
either

860
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,320
you can add pesto and make them pesto

861
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,679
flavored cookies

862
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,440
they come out green and gorgeous

863
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,210
you can add you can cook some

864
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,960
[Music]

865
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,760
or peppers or add tomato paste and make

866
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,000
it

867
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,040
red you can cook peppers and grind them

868
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,679
into a paste and add that

869
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,879
with some feta cheese or parmesan cheese

870
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,359
or any kind of cheese you like

871
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,480
you can add spices you can add cinnamon

872
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,239
or ginger um if you're making safer

873
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,399
cookies you can add paprika

874
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,119
which is really cool it also makes like

875
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,520
really red and awesome

876
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,639
you can do pretty much anything um a

877
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,079
personal tip

878
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,918
is you can use you can do

879
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,079
you can make as many different types of

880
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,079
cookies you want in the same bowl

881
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,520
you don't even have to wash it in

882
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,160
between uh my tip would be to start with

883
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,280
the

884
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,680
lighter colored and flavored cookies and

885
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,920
make that batch put in the fridge then

886
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,839
make the next one that's a little bit

887
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,000
darker or with stronger flavor than put

888
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,200
that in the fridge

889
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,960
because then you don't it doesn't get

890
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,880
mixed up in a way that

891
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,800
um mixes up the flavors like i'll start

892
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,200
with

893
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,920
simple vanilla cookies then i'll make um

894
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,320
coffee flavored cookies that'll make

895
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,000
chocolate flavored cookies because the

896
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,240
chocolate ones are the darkest so

897
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,760
if i have leftovers on the on the bowl

898
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,440
i don't want to get them mixed up into

899
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,280
the next batch

900
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,359
that way i make like the five different

901
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,960
types of cookies

902
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,880
in one go in one bowl

903
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,640
in 20 minutes and you can experiment you

904
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,000
can do whatever you want with them

905
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,040
here i really wanted to either have a

906
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
live demo but i'm not using my own house

907
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,480
so i don't have the materials in my

908
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,440
kitchen

909
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,560
and i'm a much better baker than a

910
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,680
photographer

911
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,480
so the pictures of my cookies are not as

912
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,200
pretty

913
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,839
as those random ones i found on google

914
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:14,400
search

915
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,920
so you'll have to just trust me

916
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,560
then you can also you know match it for

917
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,240
your dietary restrictions if you can't

918
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,680
have sugar you can

919
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,079
replace the sugar with whichever

920
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,359
substitute

921
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,000
you like best if you can't have dairy

922
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,400
like i said you don't have to use butter

923
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,920
coconut oil is magic

924
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,400
if you have if you can't eat gluten you

925
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,480
can use gluten-free flour

926
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,079
i'll just say that any kind of

927
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,560
pastry does need a little bit of gluten

928
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,320
to hold it together these cookies still

929
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,359
have gluten

930
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,839
so gluten-free flour will give a much

931
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,280
more um much more crumbly cookies that

932
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,119
won't hold together as well that's just

933
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:57,599
the

934
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,640
downside of using gluten-free flour um

935
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,320
there are ways to improve that but i'm

936
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
not really an expert on that so

937
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,079
i can't really say much other than that

938
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,000
um see i can keep talking about cookies

939
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,520
for like three more hours but i think

940
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,720
that's our time

941
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,680
so i'll open it up to questions from

942
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,640
anyone

943
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,160
yeah so you you have some time for

944
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,000
questions the first question we had

945
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,599
there's lots of clicky questions people

946
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,160
people were amazed and odd and a little

947
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,240
overwhelmed with cet but

948
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,160
they want to know how long cookie dough

949
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,720
stores in the fridge

950
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,200
oh in the fridge it stores up to three

951
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,160
days

952
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,560
and in the freezer up to three months

953
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,160
and you can also put it in the freezer

954
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,920
for as long as you want after three

955
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,880
months

956
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,880
um and as a disc or something and then

957
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,480
move it to the fridge for six to twelve

958
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,920
hours

959
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,520
and then you can roll it and do whatever

960
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,359
you want with it for example use it as

961
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,599
pie dough

962
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,960
perfect thank you um a bunch of people

963
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,400
want to know a little bit more about

964
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,240
making whiskey or bourbon cookies

965
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,440
because you brought them up and they're

966
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,200
really excited about them

967
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,000
can you give them a few tips on that yes

968
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,119
absolutely

969
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,400
if you're going to add alcohol to

970
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,040
cookies you really don't need much

971
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,839
if you use too much the alcohol might um

972
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,240
mess up the ratios a little bit

973
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,839
you want to add um if you're using let's

974
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:24,800
say 100

975
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,680
150 grams of flour you want to have

976
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,119
probably up to

977
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,160
two spoons of alcohol um

978
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,839
you want to use that instead of liquid

979
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,320
because alcohol is still mostly liquid

980
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,960
after you bake the cookies there won't

981
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,640
there shouldn't be any alcohol left in

982
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,359
them

983
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,760
because we do bake them in pretty high

984
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,880
temperatures um

985
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,680
around 170 degrees celsius i do not know

986
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,160
how much that is in fahrenheit

987
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,160
um and try using alcohol with

988
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,839
slightly um slightly stronger flavor

989
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,640
than you would drink normally alcohol

990
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,040
like

991
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,520
bourbons or whiskeys that are very

992
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,400
smooth

993
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,079
uh the flavor will probably get um

994
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,240
a lot lighter inside the cookie so you

995
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,119
do want to use

996
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,680
either a little bit more or a little bit

997
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,320
um

998
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,320
stronger flavor than you would drink

999
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,440
thank you so much and a personal tip uh

1000
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,839
it works really it's a bit of

1001
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,760
counterintuitive it works

1002
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,760
great with coffee flavor

1003
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,800
wow i never would have guessed uh

1004
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,520
we have a cet question um it's kind of a

1005
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,520
broad one so maybe you can take a crack

1006
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,240
at it it's

1007
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,560
how effective do you think it'll really

1008
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,480
be at

1009
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,400
dealing with recent past windows

1010
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,720
exploits

1011
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,440
um but my answer to that is going to be

1012
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,960
a tiny little bit cynical

1013
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,839
but it can be very effective if it's

1014
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,119
enabled

1015
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,359
but i don't really see it being

1016
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,720
generally enabled

1017
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,599
by default on windows builds anytime

1018
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,160
soon

1019
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,359
um first no one has a processor yet it's

1020
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,520
it's newly shipped but also microsoft

1021
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,800
has tendency to

1022
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,040
not enable new mitigations for a long

1023
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,480
long long time

1024
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,760
and not enforce them you still see um

1025
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,680
applications running out there without

1026
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,960
stuff like aslr

1027
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,160
which have been around for 12

1028
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,119
15 years at this point um so i think it

1029
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,200
will be a pretty long time until we see

1030
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,440
an

1031
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,640
actual effect there until people update

1032
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,280
their system

1033
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,200
people update their processors and

1034
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,119
microsoft actually starts

1035
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,480
enforcing the use of the use of that

1036
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,160
that's certainly the very pragmatic

1037
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,920
answer i think that's

1038
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,240
all the questions we have i want to

1039
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,599

1041
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:47,790
