putting this on

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,440
i did attend last year's event and i

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,200
just thought it was something that was

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,880
so cool to kind of bring everybody

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,559
together when we're all put in a really

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,079
tough situation and

10
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,680
here we are almost a year later and

11
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,920
we're kind of still in that situation

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,240
and

13
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,000
um it's still really good to be able to

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,359
connect with people

15
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,680
um i know it for myself and my family

16
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,359
it's really helped out

17
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,039
you know using technology during the

18
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,679
pandemic so i just wanted to

19
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,120
throw that out there so i'm here to talk

20
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,719
to you today about hunting evil file

21
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,239
hashes and processes

22
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,120
using powershell automation and do it

23
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,680
yourself

24
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,440
how to build and paint custom wood

25
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,680
shelving my name is blake regan

26
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,840
i'm a senior security analyst at wesco

28
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,320
and my clicker is not working so who am

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,800

we're having a baby girl

33
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,799
we found out the gender yesterday so i

34

am now a girl dad for life

35
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,400
so very happy for that i started at it

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
in 2010

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,799
and i formally worked in the

38
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,280
construction industry you may notice the

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,880
tie-in between the it

40
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,280
and hobby slash craft for my talk

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,040
i really started information security

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,400
working in the field in 2014

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,680
i have a sysadmin background working in

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,560
engineering

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,640
and then also in information security

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,400
most recently blue team

47
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,680
digital forensics threat hunting and

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
i'm also a hockey fanatic fan and player

49
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,439
i really love the sport i'm glad that we

50
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,640
got to have an nhl

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,040
season somewhat this year that has also

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,799
helped me out during the pandemic

53
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,119
you know not able to get out and play

54
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,040
only watch it on tv

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,880
i'm sure many of you can relate to

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,159
similar things in your life

57
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,399
i also enjoy mountain biking slash trail

58
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,079
riding there's not a lot of

59
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,920
mountains in illinois but we do have

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,759
some pretty good trail systems so i do

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,040
enjoy that

62
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,679
i got into that earlier on in my life my

63
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,200
cousins who are older

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,599
got me into mountain biking and i just

65
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,440
just fell in love with it so i recently

66
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,760
got

67
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,879
back into it which is good

68
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,120
i'm an automation enthusiast um 2014

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,000
i started working at motorola solutions

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,840
in the systems engineering

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
and my manager gave me a challenge

72
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
to turn a raspberry pi into an automated

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,680
usb

74
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,760
scanner now i knew linux command line

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,440
but i didn't know how how to do

76
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,400
automation or you know

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,239
file detection state detection

78
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,239
everything like that

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,440
and i ended up really liking that

80
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,200
project actually a co-worker really

81
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,920
helped me out

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,680
during that project too and it kind of

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,440
sparked a passion

84
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,840
and i picked up powershell and

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
powershell and i are like this

86
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,879
um so following that

87
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,000
serial learner um i have a couple

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,519
certifications

89
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,000
uh i really enjoy you know

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,040
certifications

91
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,480
everybody in the industry has a

92
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,159
different opinion for me

93
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,400
it's what kind of work do you put in

94
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,080
during the time that you're preparing

95
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,599
for that cert it's not just that you

96
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,720
passed it

97
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,360
but in my own journey what i've found is

98
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,239
that

99
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,200
doing that that that self-care and

100
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,319
commitment

101
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,560
you end up learning so much more so for

102
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,400
anybody who's new to the field who's

103
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,120
trying to get into information security

104
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,840
keep at it take advantage of learning

105
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,080
opportunities it may not have to be a

106
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,599
high-priced cert that

107
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,959
you know takes you three months to

108
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,200
prepare for but just these little steps

109
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,040
like attending

110
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,959
a con like this today and kind of

111
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,239
learning about some new things that

112
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,760
maybe you're interested in

113
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,120
or pursuing that that next cert my

114
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,439
personal opinion is that doing something

115
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,360
like a network plus security plus is a

116
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,959
really good starting point because it's

117
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,400
vendor agnostic

118
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,640
and it focuses on the fundamentals and i

119
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,080
think that's one thing

120
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,480
the information security community could

121
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,599
do better on

122
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,080
right you have a 10 character password

123
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,560
policy but you want to go cloud first

124
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,798
or you have windows server 2003

125
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,959
but you're going to implement dlp right

126
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,199
we got to get back to the basics

127
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,560
so um

128
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,919
my talk today is uh in my

129
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,120
journey is cis admin blue teamer um i

130
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,759
find myself

131
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,400
doing a lot of tasks maybe repetitively

132
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
and finding opportunity to automate

133
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,360
those tasks

134
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
and so this past year during the

135
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,840
pandemic i pushed myself outside my

136
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,960
comfort zone

137
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,840
and i started um developing tools that i

138
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,040
used at work

139
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,520
and making them be applicable to many

140
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,199
situations and then sharing that on

141
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,080
github

142
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,639
right so it's not sensitive information

143
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,360
just

144
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
the frameworks or theories that other

145
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,479
people can benefit from

146
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,639
so what i'd like to do today is demo a

147
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,800
new tool that i've been working on

148
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
this is an improvement from a previous

149
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,400
tool um

150
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,720
i used to search for files i knew where

151
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,400
the file location was and i knew the

152
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,199
file name

153
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,280
and i needed to get rid of it so i came

154
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
up with a script to use

155
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,160
windows rm and pass that script to a

156
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,320
large collection of servers

157
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,400
and instead of going manually to each

158
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,919
server and doing this action

159
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,639
like the old school days now we're

160
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,639
working with a thousand servers passing

161
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,000
a script block

162
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
and really being efficient and getting

163
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,320
repeatable results

164
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,520
and so um i came up with an idea to

165
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,600
um it's kind of sparked in the past

166
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,320
months where several large name vendors

167
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,360
have had compromises and um

168
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,759
csa releases indicators of compromise

169
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,440
that everybody needs to look for and

170
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,800
detect

171
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,560
in some situations you don't have you

172
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,720
know an edr edr tool

173
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,440
enterprise detection response you don't

174
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,160
have a way to look for hashes

175
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,400
or maybe your the tool that you have

176
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,560
only supports md5 hash and not sha 256.

177
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,479
so this tool will help you do that

178
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,560
it does make a couple assumptions it

179
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
assumes that you know the path that

180
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,600
you're looking for

181
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,039
and you know the hash that you're

182
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,520
looking for so let's go ahead and check

183
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
that out i've posted it on github right

184
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,240
before

185
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,360
my presentation i call it huntress i

186
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,560
think it's really cool

187
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,600
the powershell open source logo is this

188
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,639
uh really um

189
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,680
awesome character that just looks like a

190
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,560
huntress

191
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,880
and also kind of inspired from my

192
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,680
daughter

193
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,039
um she's just awesome and so uh that was

194
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,720
the fitting name for this tool

195
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,240
so let's go ahead and check that out i'm

196
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,000
going to switch over to a video real

197
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,639
quick so

198
00:06:50,639 --> 00:07:03,840
bear with me a moment

199
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,199
so uh the first part of this uh

200
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,440
got a little choppy because cam studio

201
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,560
doesn't like when you don't have

202
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,360
anything

203
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
active on the screen the refresh rate

204
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,560
flutters so

205
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,280
again the part that was missing was that

206
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
this tool assumes that you know

207
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,000
um the location and the hash that you're

208
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
going to use but let's play the video

209
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,280
and i recorded this because the demo

210
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,000
gods

211
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,440
i don't know if i have enough karma to

212
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,759
do well so let's let the video

213
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,880
do the work sharp hound

214
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,080
found in windows system 32 directory

215
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,919
and also mimikits placed in the public

216
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,840
downloads directory

217
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,800
so let's go ahead and take a look at the

218
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,759
script together

219
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,560
before we run it just to show you some

220
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,840
of the basics

221
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,680
so this script has been designed as a

222
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,800
function

223
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,560
so you'll import the function into

224
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,160
memory and then

225
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,160
execute that function

226
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,960
to identify the indicators of compromise

227
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,319
and file paths

228
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,599
as discussed before i've set up a

229
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,479
framework

230
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,800
for you to identify areas to

231
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,919
place sha-256 hashes

232
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,440
and file paths if you need to modify

233
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,000
this

234
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,839
for different algorithms

235
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,640
you can do so just by placing a

236
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,000
different algorithm

237
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,719
in the hash

238
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,320
value you'll also notice

239
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,519
that we're defining a script block named

240
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,519
huntress script block will later on be

241
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,279
passed to a collection of member servers

242
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,560
using the invoke command

243
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,000
script block parameter

244
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,120
we also be taking a transcript anytime

245
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,279
that this script runs

246
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,760
it is difficult to capture the output

247
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,120
from a script

248
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,240
executed on a remote host

249
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
so we will be transcribing the screen

250
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,360
output

251
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,480
to document for later incident response

252
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,800
use

253
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,160
if we look here in the script it starts

254
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,640
to

255
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,120
test that path that you defined to see

256
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,200
if that path exists

257
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,080
if that path exists it will continue on

258
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,279
and it will

259
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,640
enumerate the contents of that path

260
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
and pass it to the get file hash

261
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,160
commandlet

262
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,399
those contents will be stored in an

263
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,720
array

264
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,600
if the path does not exist that check

265
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,959
will fail

266
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,000
and this portion of the script

267
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,040
will be checked and defined as false

268
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,320
we talked about the array of hashes

269
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,720
we also talked about our chuck here so

270
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,959
this means that the path must exist to

271
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:09,839
continue on

272
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,680
to eliminate errors now that we have our

273
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,640
array of hashes defined

274
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,160
we will use a for each command

275
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,920
to iterate through each

276
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,279
hash identified in the directory

277
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,760
we will then evaluate if that hash

278
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,440
matches

279
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,880
the hash value that you previously

280
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
defined

281
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,160
if this turns out to be true we will

282
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,240
write an alert on the screen

283
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,880
which will facilitate documenting this

284
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,800
in our transcript

285
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,000
we'll also list the path

286
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,279
of the hash

287
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,640
match and the host name that

288
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,760
matches on this may seem trivial

289
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,680
if you're working with two to three

290
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,480
hosts but in a large domain

291
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,160
with 50 000 member servers and a large

292
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
number of workstations

293
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,079
you definitely will want to have those

294
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,279
uniquely named

295
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,959
host names in your log files

296
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,279
so this second loop does the same as the

297
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,240
first

298
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,440
and i'm just demonstrating that you

299
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,839
may encounter situations where you need

300
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,560
to

301
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,120
search multiple directories with

302
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,800
multiple hash values

303
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
now again this script is a proof of

304
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,839
concept and i've posted it on github

305
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,000
so if you like the idea and want to

306
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,200
expand

307
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,040
please feel free to do a pull request

308
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,079
to do a fork for yourself the reason i'm

309
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:46,880
sharing this

310
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,279
is that i think it can help many people

311
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,480
and also help you

312
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,120
expand your powershell automation skills

313
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,200
if that's something you're looking to do

314
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,480
so as we move down this contents that we

315
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,079
just went over

316
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,120
define the huntress script block

317
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,480
statement

318
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,959
now as we move down to the bottom of the

319
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,120
script we'll see here

320
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,399
that we are dynamically identifying

321
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,440
our domain this means that this script

322
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
can be moved into different domains

323
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,519
and this is one last value that you have

324
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,160
to update

325
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,880
as i mentioned earlier we can define a

326
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,800
collection of member servers

327
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,000
that we wish to pass this huntress

328
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,279
script block to

329
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,760
here i have done a simple example using

330
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,720
our

331
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,720
domain variable to then define

332
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,880
the distinguished name of the

333
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,040
organizational unit

334
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,720
that you wish to query

335
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,079
member servers and assigned to an array

336
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,120
named servers you'll see here the naming

337
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,200
criteria are simply name

338
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,680
and operating system which we then

339
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,040
evaluate

340
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,120
to identify if the operating system

341
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,120
match windows server 2012

342
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,360
2016 2019

343
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,399
we then select the object

344
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,720
properties name and operating system

345
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,279
this qualifiers right here

346
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,880
may match up with different

347
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,760
cisa alerts or different incident

348
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,320
response bulletins that you may receive

349
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,399
you can help to tune your criteria

350
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,240
something that may affect windows server

351
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,680
2012

352
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,800
may not affect windows server 2019

353
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,560
you can then filter that out to make

354
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,160
your results as accurate as possible

355
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,079
so moving on down to the end of the

356
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,320
script we reference

357
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,959
our servers is the collection that we

358
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,560
just created

359
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,920
and we say for each individual element

360
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,639
in the array

361
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,760
or each individual server we want to

362
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,079
invoke the command

363
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,399
defining computer name and from our

364
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,279
array

365
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,440
this is why we take name and operating

366
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,279
system

367
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,120
we say dot name

368
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,920
to pass this command and then we define

369
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,720
the script

370
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,839
block parameter and then we pass the

371
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,440
script block of

372
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,480
huntress to the collection

373
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
and that will go off and do its work and

374
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,399
we'll see that here shortly

375
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,800
and then just something to close this

376
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,079
review of the script

377
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,639
out with is when you're using the stop

378
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,440
start transcript and stop transcript

379
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,040
commandlets

380
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,040
since we made this script into a

381
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,480
function

382
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,079
when the function gets loaded into

383
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,480
memory it goes to evaluate the stop

384
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,440
transcript commandlet that will throw an

385
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,399
error if no

386
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,519
transcription is taking place so what i

387
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,199
have done is a workaround

388
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:06,160
is at the top of the script

389
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,560
i dynamically assigned the file name

390
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
that we will output our transcript

391
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,760
content to

392
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,880
using a time stamp and then using the

393
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,800
directory that you're running the script

394
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,399
from as the base

395
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,000
path and then adding the name huntress

396
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,199
transcript

397
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,040
and timestamp this serves two purposes

398
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,680
this allows us to have a uniquely named

399
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,560
file

400
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,040
in the same directory so if we run this

401
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,480
script multiple times

402
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,279
we don't get an error stating that the

403
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,480
file already exists

404
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,800
or is is locked by a process or so forth

405
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,160
this also allows us to define a valid

406
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,480
variable that we know is going to exist

407
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,959
which we can then get around the

408
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,399
shortcomings of the stop

409
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,759
transcript commandlet and state that

410
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,800
if start transcript is not equal to

411
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,920
null and we know that this is true

412
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,399
because we defined it we want this

413
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,519
statement

414
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,560
condition to evaluate to true so

415
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,279
therefore

416
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,399
we have done a workaround to stop

417
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,839
transcript once the script finishes

418
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,639
i hope that makes sense so let's go

419
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,720
ahead and get to the fun stuff

420
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,210
and take a look at our script here

421
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,800
[Music]

422
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,600
now you'll see right now we do not have

423
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,880
any transcript file in this directory

424
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,320
so what i'm going to do is import this

425
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,639
script into memory as i stated

426
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,880
this will pull everything into memory

427
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,759
into

428
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,120
a function which we can now call this

429
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,560
function

430
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,600
by simply calling huntress

431
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,060
from the command line

432
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,639
[Music]

433
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,320
you'll see that the script generates the

434
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,800
transcript file and starts

435
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,880
querying through the directories and

436
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,240
evaluating hashes

437
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,480
we've already found our first match

438
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,839
which was mimikatz

439
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,880
that we saw matching the hash that we

440
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,480
provided

441
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
the script is moving on to the windows

442
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,880
system 32 directory

443
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,599
and then continuing on as you'll see we

444
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,599
have web server

445
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,679
and then we're moving on to file server

446
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,160
now this is a small test domain

447
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,760
but if this were a large production

448
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,640
domain this would take much longer

449
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,200
as it cycles through the large

450
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,400
collection of servers

451
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,440
so we'll wait for this to finish and

452
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,360
then we'll go check out our transcript

453
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,559
it looks like we have some ir work to do

454
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,120
after this script is done

455
00:17:49,120 --> 00:18:01,840
generating results

456
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,080
you'll notice this is taking a little

457
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,960
longer since this is a remote host

458
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,440
and we are iterating through the dire

459
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,000
the contents of the windows system 32

460
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,200
directory

461
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,240
gathering hashes and then comparing

462
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,120
these hashes

463
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:29,840
to the hash that we defined

464
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,160
the video feeds okay my screen filter

465
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,840
turned on at the end of the recording

466
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,200
and i didn't want to stop

467
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:57,840
so just a note there

468
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,579
[Music]

469
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,000
okay our script is finished

470
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,600
my screen is fading

471
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,200
we can see here that this list

472
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,919
the username that we ran the script with

473
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,760
the timestamp

474
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
also lists the hostname that the script

475
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,520
was run from

476
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,679
and then we also have the results of our

477
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,880
script that generated

478
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,200
for our file and we see that these are

479
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,440
two

480
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,559
iocs found on each host and now we need

481
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,720
to engage our ir team

482
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,840
to go and identify what else we need to

483
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,280
do i hope that you find this script

484
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
useful

485
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,799
and please do a pull request do a fork

486
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,840
and thank you for watching

487
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,120
all right so that was hash huntress and

488
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,679
um

489
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,880
i think you can see the concept of the

490
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,760
tool

491
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,159
is to make things easier to detect

492
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,840
iocs at scale so i was working on

493
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,440
trying to iterate through all

494
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,320
directories and then check hashes

495
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,880
i've been struggling with that because

496
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,280
while you can define

497
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,039
um so many levels deep in a directory

498
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,480
if the file remains in that directory

499
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,200
one more level deep it won't find it so

500
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,480
i'm still thinking about that

501
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,919
but i know there's a lot of smart people

502
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,679
out there and if you know a way to do

503
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,480
that

504
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,600
do a pull request i think this this tool

505
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:51,919
is

506
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,240
is good to use it has a purpose right

507
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,919
it's not a show stopper

508
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,600
and it's not the new hottest thing but

509
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,799
it is effective it is efficient and

510
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,880
it works so i hope that this is

511
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,400
something that you can use

512
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,080
or someone that you know can use um

513
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,960
and i'd like to transition on to talking

514
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,679
about

515
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,880
carpentry i mentioned that my

516
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,320
background was in the construction

517
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,080
industry i used to

518
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,440
do remodeling build homes framing

519
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,159
trim carpentry commercial remodeling and

520
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,600
in 2007

521
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,400
the u.s economy took a turn real estate

522
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,240
and so i had to find something different

523
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,200
to do

524
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,840
and i had always been good with

525
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,640
technology

526
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,559
good with computers and happenstance

527
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,120
watched the movie hackers and just fell

528
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,600
in love with the culture right just

529
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,039
uh that clever playfulness right um

530
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,720
understanding something well enough that

531
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,600
you can find ways around things or

532
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,799
be a better defender right so um

533
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,360
but carpentry and construction has will

534
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,640
never leave me

535
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,000
um over the pandemic my wife and i

536
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,039
remodeled our bathroom upstairs

537
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,960
and so for part of the project uh near

538
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,200
the end i knew pancakes com was coming

539
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,760
up

540
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,640
so i used a gopro to if i were to be

541
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,919
selected which

542
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,960
i ended up presenting um use a gopro to

543
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,600
document

544
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,919
making these custom shelves that we

545
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,039
built in our bathroom

546
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,480
and i think that this could be something

547
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,640
that you can do as well and so i'd like

548
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,400
to play another video

549
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,440
i will do a little narration on there

550
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,679
and let's check it out so give me a

551
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:41,840
moment here so i can share that video

552
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,600
right your screen

553
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,600
all right so at the beginning here i'm

554
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,360
i'm doing a layout and one of the

555
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,880
important things about

556
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,960
doing your layout especially when you're

557
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,280
attaching things to a wall

558
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,559
to support weight is you want to find

559
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,080
the studs in the wall

560
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,000
now stud detectors work but only so well

561
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,559
so i like the old school method where

562
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,000
you use a hammer and a nail and if

563
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,919
you'll notice i'm doing it right above

564
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,600
the laser line because i'm going to be

565
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,080
installing cleats for the shelf so you

566
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,720
won't see it if you watch here you'll

567
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,679
see that

568
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,919
i do strike out a couple times on this

569
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,039
inside wall

570
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,520
here but eventually you'll know that

571
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,159
sound because

572
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,080
also you'll be pounding the nail and

573
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,679
it'll stop going

574
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,919
right and you'll see me uh struggle to

575
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,799
pull that out so

576
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,720
so again the importance of this is if

577
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,880
you're putting things on the shelves

578
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,240
and also wear a mask so we're

579
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,679
transitioning here to uh

580
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,559
manufacturing stock for the shelves so

581
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,760
when you buy lumber from the store

582
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,440
typically if you get clear or s4s that's

583
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,080
square

584
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,679
four sides the edges will be very sharp

585
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,720
on all corners so to take care of that

586
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,480
you want to use a random orbit

587
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,080
sander random orbit similar to a random

588
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,480
number generator

589
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,960
oscillates and changes direction that

590
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,799
it's cutting the grain of the wood

591
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,080
so it doesn't reduce material

592
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,640
like a belt sander would to to remove

593
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,760
material

594
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,320
the orbital sander kind of opens up the

595
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,440
pores of the wood

596
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,480
which is okay important because you want

597
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,039
to let that

598
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,919
paint penetrate or if you're painting

599
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,840
you want that primer to absorb that

600
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,360
primer gives you that good

601
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,240
coat to get your finished paint coat on

602
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,400
there

603
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,840
so you'll notice here that i'm cutting

604
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,919
these i've done my math and done my

605
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,120
measurements

606
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,240
they'll be different in your home so

607
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,520
but i'm doing my measurements here to

608
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,600
make my pieces now that i've sanded them

609
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,240
down

610
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
and i've used a table saw to cut them to

611
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,400
the proper width

612
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,720
we're now making them all the same size

613
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
right and that's kind of the

614
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,480
something that i carried from

615
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,360
construction

616
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,960
into infosec is sometimes it's important

617
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,320
to be able to

618
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,279
build a scalable solution to start with

619
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,159
small pieces

620
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,880
get them uniform find out that that

621
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,679
template that

622
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,240
pilot and you'll see this later on

623
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,440
as we install these shelves so right now

624
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,919
i'm sanding the tops of the shelves

625
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,480
again using that random orbit sander

626
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,400
you'll notice that i'm moving the sander

627
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,840
in an up and down direction

628
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,679
you would want to lean in the same

629
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,720
direction notice the green of the wood

630
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,600
is going

631
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,720
perpendicular to my body you wouldn't

632
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,640
want to go across the brain

633
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,039
most standards you can do that with a

634
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,039
random orbit sander because as we talk

635
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,159
about

636
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,000
it cuts that grain of wood in a

637
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,080
different way

638
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,919
so this tool here you'll see is called a

639
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,200
kreg jig

640
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,480
this allows you to ins to make

641
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,840
pocket screws and you'll notice the

642
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,440
angle that this is drilling on the

643
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,679
beauty of pocket screws is it allows you

644
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,000
to

645
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,279
join two materials together

646
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,760
in a secure fashion without having to

647
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,880
nail through or

648
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,919
screw through the face of the material

649
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,840
and so after we finish drilling these

650
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,240
holes

651
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,159
and using wood glue it's always

652
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,440
important when you're when you're

653
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,200
working with raw wood

654
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,919
and assembling it to use wood glue wood

655
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,240
glue does some special bond

656
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,679
between the fibers that really is very

657
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,320
strong

658
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,159
and will help to make sure that over

659
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,640
time if there's moisture changes in your

660
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,919
environment

661
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,720
that the seams that you create don't

662
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,760
separate

663
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,799
or expand

664
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,159
and that really makes a difference when

665
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,919
you're doing finished products like

666
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,880
we're doing today

667
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,320
also my garage has been my office during

668
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,440
the pandemic

669
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,559
so i had to protect everything with drop

670
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,520
cloths

671
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,919
and tarps to not get sawdust everywhere

672
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,600
and yes it was cold

673
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,240
during the winter but there's many worse

674
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,840
things that could happen

675
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,679
so you'll see one of these is assembled

676
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,120
and if you'll notice here you'll see

677
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,039
those screws are on an angle

678
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,679
that's that pocket screw that allows to

679
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,640
have

680
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,840
the travel ends up going to on an

681
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,360
angle up into the face of the wood that

682
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,360
you're attaching and securely attaching

683
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
it

684
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,000
[Music]

685
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,480
so i'm using an impact driver and an

686
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,760
impact driver

687
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,279
uh is different than a screw gun because

688
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,480
it it operates on resistance

689
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,559
there's an anvil inside the head of the

690
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,000
tool that hits

691
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,960
on the spinning mandrel and when that

692
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,919
happens

693
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,200
it creates a lot of torque which

694
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,840
can securely tighten screws without

695
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,240
stripping

696
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,559
and so that's how these kreg jig screws

697
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,440
you may notice

698
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,320
that the end of the bit is a square

699
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,039
drive bit

700
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,240
and that's to make sure that that torque

701
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,000
if you were to use like a phillips or a

702
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,279
plus two

703
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,840
standard head you may end up stripping

704
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,120
that screw head

705
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,000
so that's the beauty of the square drive

706
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,880
you also notice that i have adjusted

707
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,399
you'll notice that i'm gonna back out

708
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,320
one of these screws

709
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,919
because the face wasn't lined up

710
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,679
correctly so that's one of the things

711
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,679
too with finished carpentry is

712
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,240
you need to use your fingers a lot and

713
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,279
and

714
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,039
and trust your instincts right if it

715
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,279
feels right it's most likely going to be

716
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:23,840
right

717
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,919
but if it feels like there's a big ridge

718
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,240
or things aren't even

719
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,640
it's a lot of work so you can see here

720
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,440
that i got this as close as i could

721
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,000
now i'm using that random orbit sander

722
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,880
to

723
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,919
stand these now to join of

724
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,720
wood together and get them on the same

725
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,919
plane on top

726
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,240
so that when we paint this at the end

727
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:55,840
we'll have a nice

728
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,000
so here we're talking about when i

729
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
talked about earlier about scaling up

730
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,399
and starting out with a with a template

731
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,520
format

732
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,799
and then scaling up you'll see that

733
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,840
um my layout has now transferred

734
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,080
using the laser level which really helps

735
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,720
you when you're trying to

736
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,159
attach pieces of wood with precise

737
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,120
tolerances

738
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,159
that laser level lets you use your

739
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,960
eyes to get it right instead of holding

740
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,480
the piece of wood up and then putting a

741
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,559
level on top and trying to balance that

742
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,120
and using the nail gun

743
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,679
if you if you're going to do a project

744
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,240
like this

745
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,360
i recommend looking at a laser level you

746
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,279
don't have to get the most expensive one

747
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,799
out there but they will make a big

748
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,840
difference as you can see

749
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,640
so the benefit of us finding our studs

750
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,760
in the wall

751
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,799
is now we know for sure that we are

752
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,080
attaching these

753
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,320
in a secure manner so if we put weight

754
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,919
on these you don't have to worry about

755
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,000
them coming loose

756
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,399
uh it's very important now on this

757
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,320
outside wall right here this is the back

758
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,919
of a shower wall

759
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,240
so again this is why it's very important

760
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,600
to make sure that you need

761
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,039
studs and not metal pipes now

762
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,120
if you're using the nail and hammer you

763
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,320
won't go through

764
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,799
you can go through a water pipe but you

765
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,640
really have to work at it

766
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,440
but if you're using a nail gun you can

767
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,000
go through a water pipe very easy

768
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,039
i have done it before it is not fun

769
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,519
so please make sure to take the time and

770
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,039
know what's

771
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,880
you know that collateral damage that can

772
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,120
happen in the surface

773
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,960
beyond what you're working it's very

774
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,799
important it also

775
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,480
doesn't take a lot of extra time to do

776
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,720
now you notice here i've used i'm

777
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,080
pointing to the screen you can't see

778
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,640
that

779
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,559
i'm scraping off the extra construction

780
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,679
adhesive because if you let that dry

781
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,679
and then go to put the shelf on top of

782
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,519
there that construction adhesive is

783
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,960
going to be very firm

784
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,039
and it's not it's going to work against

785
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,039
your level layout that you've done

786
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,279
so just make sure to clean up any excess

787
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,080
there

788
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,080
and also when you're using wood glue

789
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,679
which i highly recommend

790
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,760
here we've got the and wood glue really

791
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,200
only works on raw

792
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,159
surfaces raw wood to raw wood if there's

793
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,200
primer there

794
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,480
you can use sandpaper and sand that raw

795
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,399
and then use the wood glue to get that

796
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,320
bond but it won't work if it's

797
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,440
if it's prime trim to primed trim it

798
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,200
doesn't work the same way you would want

799
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,519
to use a construction adhesive

800
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,559
so here you'll see that we have our four

801
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,720
assembled shelves that we put together

802
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,799
and when you cut these to width give

803
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,240
yourself a break

804
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,760
you can have a sixteenth to less than an

805
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,159
eighth

806
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,919
inch on each side because your walls

807
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,600
aren't always going to be

808
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,519
100 straight or 90 degrees

809
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,679
all the time so give yourself a break

810
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,880
when you're using

811
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,000
paint grade trim you can cover

812
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,039
up any of the extra gaps

813
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,440
within reason i say eighth of an inch is

814
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,440
about as far as i would go

815
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,960
you can fill that with pop and you'll

816
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,799
see that in a little bit here i'm going

817
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,880
to show you how to finish this

818
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,519
really precise manner and this is um

819
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,519
i really enjoy this i know it's tedious

820
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,840
work but for me it's soothing

821
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,919
so i really got a lot of benefit out of

822
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,360
this project

823
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,360
working on the weekends i started in

824
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,399
july

825
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,080
and just finished at the beginning of

826
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,919
the year

827
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,440
and it really helped me to have kind of

828
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,080
an escape not an escape but

829
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,840
something to just to do and while i'm at

830
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,240
home

831
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,000
so i'm priming the shelves here it's

832
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,559
important to use a primer on raw wood

833
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,799
um it gives that seals up the pores

834
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,039
and then after that dries you can sand

835
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,080
it

836
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,000
and now you're creating a a nice

837
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,040
base for your finish

838
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,159
to cover so you'll see here get yourself

839
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,760
a small roller you don't want to use a

840
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,119
9-inch roller

841
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,719
on 23-inch shelves you get the small

842
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,599
little four inch

843
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,000
whistle rollers and they work really

844
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,040
nice can get into

845
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,560
the tight spaces you'll see here

846
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,119
and now i'm working with um putty

847
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,040
there's a specific kind of spackle that

848
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,480
i like it's the

849
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,918
dap you know patch

850
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,560
it smells terrible wear a mask when you

851
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,359
use it

852
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,320
but it really um it doesn't shrink so

853
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,079
you'll see that i'm pushing and wiping

854
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,119
in that

855
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,760
putty into the nail holes it doesn't

856
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,440
shrink

857
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,119
so once it dries you can scrape the

858
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,719
excess off

859
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,239
and then go ahead and sand and you'll

860
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,000
see us get a nice

861
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,480
smooth coat and you want to go and cover

862
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
all the nail holes

863
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,440
it's easier to do it now than after you

864
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,359
get a finished coat of paint done

865
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,680
and then have to putty it and then sand

866
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,800
it and then paint it

867
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,079
and then if you have any seams here

868
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,280
you're not always going to get your

869
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,240
seams perfect

870
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,880
that's the beauty of paint grade you can

871
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,599
then go

872
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,720
and get that putty in the seams wipe it

873
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,680
in there

874
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,079
you know you want to fill that gap and

875
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,839
then just let it dry if there's excess

876
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:28,960
sticking up

877
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,520
it's also important to wear a mask this

878
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,960
stuff sanding that rest

879
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,480
i mean respiratory we've been dealing

880
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,160
with respiratory issues

881
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,320
these were a mask i didn't do it when i

882
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,599
was younger

883
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,880
and i do it now because i feel terrible

884
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,040
a couple times they haven't worn a mask

885
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,079
you feel really bad at

886
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,800
so i'm i'm demonstrating using a sanding

887
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,000
block right here

888
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,880
sanding blocks have foam ends when

889
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,800
you're going up against a painted

890
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,200
surface

891
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,839
that way if you're rubbing on it you

892
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,599
won't scratch the wall

893
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,920
now in this case it's okay because i'm

894
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,200
gonna be painting it

895
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
but that's just a trick that may help

896
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,599
you out and you can see i'm scraping off

897
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,599
some of the excess of the putty there

898
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,960
now this hand sanding gets old right so

899
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,400
after a while we're gonna break out the

900
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:27,839
power tool

901
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,119
it's also good to keep an old beat up

902
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,480
sanding block

903
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,000
sometimes where you need to sand

904
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,680
something very lightly

905
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,040
you don't want to use a brand new

906
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,720
sanding block

907
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,640
so those all beat up i have a couple of

908
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,839
them laying around

909
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,440
uh they come in handy they're like

910
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,200
really soft so you'll notice here

911
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,640
there's the random orbit sander again

912
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,560
um you can go in any direction with a

913
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,880
random orbit sander

914
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,359
make sure that you cover off the surface

915
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:01,920
you'll

916
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,560
be able to again use trust your instinct

917
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,960
for

918
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,920
so right here i'm using a dremel

919
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,520
multi-matte which i really like

920
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,720
has a triangle standing head this comes

921
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,920
in very handy

922
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:36,420
for small spaces um

923
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,489
[Music]

924
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,839
so i also recommend vacuuming your

925
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,400
surfaces

926
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,560
[Music]

927
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,800
just getting a good vacuum of everything

928
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,839
now

929
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,920
yes did i sand the bottom and then go

930
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,359
sand the top i did

931
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,400
is that the right way to do it no um

932
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,599
you know use common sense again i

933
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,800
probably vacuumed it

934
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,119
a bunch of times so here's what we're

935
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,119
talking about caulking those gaps that

936
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,960
you may have on the side

937
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,480
um it's very easy to do you don't have

938
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,880
to be a perfectionist with the caulk gun

939
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,400
you'll notice here that i didn't put

940
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,640
enough in here the caulk will let you

941
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,240
know you didn't put enough

942
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,720
in the area so you'll see me apply some

943
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,000
more

944
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,800
and keep a wet rag with you you use your

945
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,240
fingertip

946
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,599
press that clock into the um

947
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,960
between the areas the crack and get as

948
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,079
much as you can out

949
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,040
wipe it off on that rag and then go back

950
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,960
and touch up that area with the rag

951
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
because anything that you leave

952
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,520
high on the shelf or high on the wall

953
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,800
when it dries

954
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
it'll be a line in the area and you

955
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,560
don't want that

956
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,000
so you can see here just doing some

957
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,640
finish work

958
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,920
wiping it off and if you get them on the

959
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,640
wall that's okay as long as it's smooth

960
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,160
if you're gonna paint that surface

961
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,839
afterwards that's okay

962
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,800
so painting it's very important when

963
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,160
you're painting to keep

964
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,079
that brush wet it's made to hold paint

965
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,200
as you can see here that nice first even

966
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,079
stroke

967
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,400
it's a good base on there now a couple

968
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,720
tips when you're doing brush work

969
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,560
is you want to get as much paint as you

970
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,000
can on quickly

971
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,240
because as that paint starts to dry it

972
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,040
starts to get

973
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,599
tacky and as you go over it it starts to

974
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,520
make more drag marks

975
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,160
and your your smooth painted surface

976
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,040
surface

977
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,680
becomes harder to obtain so you want to

978
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,359
work fast with the paint

979
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,960
as you see here where i'm laying the

980
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,280
brush flat that's about the only time

981
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,359
you want to do that

982
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,839
is on the big surfaces to get that paint

983
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:10,800
out

984
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,079
and onto the material

985
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,160
in painting everybody says oh i got to

986
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,839
tape the wall

987
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,920
try it out you may not do well at first

988
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,760
but really you got to just look at the

989
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,280
tip of the brush

990
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,920
and look at that line that the paint is

991
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,599
giving you when you lay it onto the

992
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,640
material

993
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,720
and you just look at that line and

994
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,880
follow that line with your eye

995
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,280
and follow along with your arm as long

996
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,800
as you've got enough pain on there it

997
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,599
will flow

998
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,400
and help you keep that straight line i

999
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,160
give that to you as a challenge

1000
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,400
it may be easier than you think and it's

1001
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,240
less time and less money that blue tape

1002
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,359
is

1003
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,599
crazy expensive it has its purposes but

1004
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,560
it's just my thoughts so we're just

1005
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,839
touching up the paint here

1006
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,599
when you're doing brush work you want to

1007
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,280
make sure that you get off any excess or

1008
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,880
any drips you want them to be

1009
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,200
smooth and always go back over your

1010
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,880
surface because there may be some high

1011
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,000
points when you're done

1012
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,920
that you didn't see so this is what i

1013
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,000
was talking about following that line

1014
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,560
get paint on the brush let the brush do

1015
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,200
the work

1016
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,839
hold your arm steady and just move your

1017
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,920
arm along

1018
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,599
come back the other way now i've been

1019
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,240
painting for

1020
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,240
a long time so i've been doing it for a

1021
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,760
while but

1022
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,520
it gets easier the more you do it don't

1023
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,319
give up first try

1024
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,000
so we're just finishing up the job here

1025
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,440
you can see that now we're painting the

1026
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,240
wall

1027
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,079
it's also important i see people

1028
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,680
painting all crazy on the home

1029
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,359
do-it-yourself shows

1030
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,079
don't do that go up and down the paint

1031
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,240
is designed to have a stipple

1032
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,839
the finish needs to set up with a with a

1033
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,599
consistent coat so you'll see that i'm

1034
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,319
going over and back rolling everything

1035
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,000
that's how it's supposed to look don't

1036
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
go zigzagging all over the place and

1037
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,760
that's not how you do painting

1038
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,880
here's the finished product after

1039
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,920
everything is dried and done

1040
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,200
uh this was designed by my wife she

1041
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,079
we went over it went over the layout and

1042
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,520
this is how it looks the finished

1043
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,319
product here

1044
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,079
in our bathroom so i have the materials

1045
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,400
here that i used

1046
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,040
came out to about 151 dollars plus tax

1047
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,560
and then here are all the tools that i

1048
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,720
used i didn't put the pricing on there

1049
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,319
i've had a lot of these for a long time

1050
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,000
all right all right so let's go back to

1051
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,640

1052
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,839

great

1059
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,400
way to let people showcase some of their

1060
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,560
their infosec related skills and then

1061
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,160
hobbies and passions

1062
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,800

a shirt that my daughter has so that's

1068
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,640
why i said anonymous

1069
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,359
do good be kind right we need we need

1070
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,160
each other

1071
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,319
we need to build each other up the

1072
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,720
infosec community needs more people if

1073
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,319
you're here and you're new you're in the

1074
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,599
right place

1075
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,160
keep putting in that hard work and take

1076
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,280
chances right there are

1077
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,960
a lot of good people in this industry

1078
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,119
that that can help you get to the right

1079
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,160
places

1080
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,520
but you have to be willing to move

1081
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,359
outside your comfort zone

1082
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,920
so thank you very much and if there's

1083
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,960
any questions

1084
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,640
i'd like to open it up for questions

1085
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,200
wow that was great blake um one of the

1086
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,160
questions was

1087
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,400
why not sand prime and paint the shelf

1088
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,319
before putting the shelf on

1089
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:10,000
so it's a great question so for for me

1090
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,400
um coming from being a carpenter and

1091
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,839
painter

1092
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,960
as i mentioned not all the uh you know

1093
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,640
your wall may be

1094
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,880
23 and a half inches at one spot and

1095
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,560
then 23 and

1096
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,760
5 8 over here so you may have to trim

1097
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,000
these you may have to trim the material

1098
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,359
as you install it

1099
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,079
and for me as i mentioned i like what i

1100
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,280
found to be successful is that

1101
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,200
methodology where you start and you

1102
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:35,760
scale

1103
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,359
up so that's just the way that i like to

1104
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:39,920
do it and

1105
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,079
found to be successful you also may

1106
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,520
install something and have to take it

1107
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,160
out

1108
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,760
and do you want to paint it and prime it

1109
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,839
and sand it twice

1110
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,599
so good point

1111
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,640
um back to the powershell portion of the

1112
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,160
presentation

1113
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,319
what level was that would you say i mean

1114
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,160
is that you know kind of beginner level

1115
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,920
or

1116
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,040
you know it is

1117
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,680
i would say it's moderate i would say

1118
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,480
it's beginner

1119
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,720
moderate advanced and that's one of the

1120
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,720
reasons that i like sharing my scripts

1121
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,440
is

1122
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,000
it has i like to use some easy stuff and

1123
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,760
then i tie in some

1124
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,760
some more advanced stuff but that's the

1125
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,599
reason right if someone knows how to

1126
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,119
if they can learn how to um create file

1127
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,920
directories

1128
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,160
by naming them dynamically on a variable

1129
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,359
with a time stamp

1130
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,040
that may it be advanced for them right

1131
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,200
now but if they use that code and

1132
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:33,760
they're like

1133
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,400
okay this is how i do it okay i can

1134
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,680
build from here

1135
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,040
or like the invoke command i'm passing a

1136
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,920
script block

1137
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,599
that blew my mind when i learned how to

1138
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,000
do that so

1139
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,440
i know there's a lot of people out there

1140
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,040
that are good at powershell but maybe

1141
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,359
they

1142
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,839
they don't know about this and there's

1143
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,280
there's so many things to learn

1144
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,920
so i would say moderate

1145
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,319
i would say moderate and that's the way

1146
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,480
i wrote it too it's it's not a

1147
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,200
super complicated tool but it you can

1148
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,880
you can apply it to different situations

1149
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,000
too it may not just be

1150
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,960
for indicators of compromise to make

1151
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,240
sure that you're

1152
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,280
you know not having an incident going on

1153
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,040
you can use it to detect software like

1154
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,800
hey do we have this old version out here

1155
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,599
well

1156
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,440
our tool is our licensing tool isn't

1157
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,359
picking it up well do we know the hash

1158
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,920
yeah okay you can put it in that script

1159
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,640
and go in

1160
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,560
and get a report right so it kind of

1161
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,319
just enables you to

1162
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:33,839
to do more with less right

1163
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,520
well thanks so much blake beautiful

1164
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,839
shelves and awesome automation

1165

1166
