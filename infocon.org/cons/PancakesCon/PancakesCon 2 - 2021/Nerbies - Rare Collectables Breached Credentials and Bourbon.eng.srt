00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,200
about two types of rare collectibles

first one is of course of course reached

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,200
credentials which are

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,599
always something we like to collect and

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,280
the second one is bourbon

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,440

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,239

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,920
into a conference especially virtual

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,000

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,520
things about what's happening here

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,199
and you know i think i've heard a few

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,719
people say in the slack just how much

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,600
they're enjoying

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,280
the second part of people's talks

33
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,040
because some of this stuff is

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,320
you know not things you get to talk

35
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,159
about at conferences and you know

36
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,159
griffin payne who i work with presented

37
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,360
earlier on things that i didn't even

38
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,640
know he was passionate about

39
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,159
and so this is i think the coolest

40
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,240
format i've ever seen and i'm super

41
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,960

i've been in the industry about a decade

53
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,560
um but i spend most of my time on phone

54
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,240
calls these days in zoo meetings

55
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,159
um i'm the practice development lead for

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,000
a firm called productivity

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
which means i talk with my clients

58
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,600
mostly about what they want out of a pen

59
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,200
testing program and whether they're

60
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,119
building it in-house or having us help

61
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,799
with those types of things

62
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,719
um most of my work these days is

63
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,880
theoretical um

64
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,719
i'm a health and fitness enthusiast i

65
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,080
love working out

66
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,800
and the the uh keynote talk this morning

67
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,239
was really amazing

68
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,520
you know listening to somebody else

69
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
that's kind of in my area that's

70
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,680
a power lifter and is you know doing

71
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,879
some of the same things that i've always

72
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,239
done and had no idea that there were

73
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,680
others in infosec that were so

74
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
interested in that

75
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,720
and then last but not least i'm a

76
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,680
collector of things

77
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
i you're going to hear a lot about the

78
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,080
stuff behind me bourbon obviously

79
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,920
breach credentials and you know i'm a

80
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,840
normal person so obviously i have a

81
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,239
shelf

82
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,760
full of old cables that i can't get rid

83
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,160
of my house just seems to accumulate

84
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
things and i you know i've always kind

85
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,000
of been a collector of different things

86
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,720
even as a kid

87
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,840
so we'll start off with breach

88
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,519
credentials and my journey to becoming a

89
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,239
hoarder of flat text files

90
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,040
so first you may or may not know kind of

91
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,239
what this topic is about

92
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,720
breach credentials right so have you

93
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,560
ever gotten an email like this

94
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,239
you know something from i just got from

95
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,840
google about a month ago

96
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,680
change your compromise password google

97
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,680
found some of your passwords online

98
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,959
and you kind of make this face in the

99
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,959
corner and say you know what like what

100
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,760
do you mean

101
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,680
you found some of my passwords online

102
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,200
how is the company doing this what are

103
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,560
they looking at what is a

104
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,000
you know what is the password doing kind

105
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,360
of floating around out there and how did

106
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,319
they tie it back to me

107
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,319
or maybe you've seen these types of

108
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,959
headlines you know and this is all

109
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,080
from about a month ago a new

110
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,360
breach compilation called the

111
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,599
compilation of many breaches or comb

112
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,480
c-o-m-b and this is a large you know a

113
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,239
large collection of breached credentials

114
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,720
about 3.2 billion records that's just

115
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,640
floating around the dark web and now the

116
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,519
clear web

117
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,319
and so what are these things so these

118
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,599
breach credentialed lists

119
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,439
have been floating around for a number

120
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,040
of years and i really started tracking

121
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,680
this

122
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,879
around january of 2019 essentially they

123
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,159
are flat text files

124
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,799
with user name and password pairs that

125
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,200
have

126
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,319
been accumulated from past corporate

127
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,120
breaches

128
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,280
or you know websites that have

129
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,040
unintentionally leaked data

130
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,400
and around 2019 i started seeing um

131
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,320
some news coming out from sites like

132
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,238
troy hunts have i been pwned

133
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,720
in krebs on security talking about these

134
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
compilations that attackers or threat

135
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,479
actors were putting together

136
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,680
of all these previous breaches and how

137
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,280
attackers were starting to use these

138
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,880
things to be more targeted in the way

139
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,639
that they conduct password guessing

140
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
attacks

141
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,040
and so collection one um in january 2019

142
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,320
was really kind of my first

143
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,479
first foray into trying to download one

144
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,400
of these then i'll talk about how i did

145
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,960
that

146
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,720
but since then i've i've continued to

147
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,560
track the news and track these being

148
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,600
released and have continued to download

149
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,160
and query these things both for kind of

150
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,360
my personal

151
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,520
joy and for you know things that i do at

152
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
work and you know it's awesome to be

153
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,280
able to go to a client kind of show and

154
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,639
tell this

155
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,280
as an example of why you know passwords

156
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,080
are not always

157
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,520
you know a great security control

158
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,120
so i mentioned you know first of all

159
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,639
what what are these things these breach

160
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,080
credentials list if you've never gotten

161
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,440
your hands on one of these

162
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,880
this is the directory structure that

163
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,800
you're typically looking at

164
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,360
they come in a compressed file that when

165
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,560
you decompress

166
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,759
um it's a directory structure by

167
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,680
letter and by number and this is the

168
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,360
first character of that password and

169
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,080
it's

170
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,280
um you know several levels deep because

171
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,320
there's so many

172
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,600
of these text files and you know 3.2

173
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,000
billion

174
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,199
records that it has to be fairly

175
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,280
embedded and there's several directories

176
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,240
in this tree

177
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,840
to be able to fit all these text files

178
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,320
into a single compressed folder

179
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,080
and then when you actually look at some

180
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,840
of these files and i'm just tailing a

181
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,120
specific

182
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,960
file here under the n o directory

183
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,199
it's quite literally just a collection

184
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,280
of email addresses and associated

185
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,240
passwords

186
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,840
for those accounts that have been seen

187
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,120
somewhere out on the internet

188
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,600
and so that's great right cool so you

189
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,360
got a text file you got a bunch of old

190
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,280
usernames and passwords that

191
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,440
we think might be valid who knows some

192
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,360
are from 10 20 years ago

193
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,000
from breaches from random sites that you

194
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,840
know people may not use anymore so

195
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,560
kind of why right why does it matter and

196
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,319
a single attack really got me interested

197
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,080
in this kind of username and credential

198
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,280
list collection

199
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,000
and querying and it was i'd say probably

200
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,440
three years ago

201
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,120
and it actually didn't stem from a

202
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,639
collection list

203
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,560
it came from this time-based exchange

204
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,720
weakness or kind of the way that

205
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,639
microsoft exchange used to work

206
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,400
in querying users and i was actually

207
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,160
doing a penetration test against a large

208
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,840
regional bank and i came across this

209
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,039
tool by daftac

210
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,280
called mail sniper and one of the

211
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,800
functionalities in mail sniper

212
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
allowed you to execute essentially brute

213
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,759
force attacks against microsoft exchange

214
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,560
looking for valid usernames and it was

215
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,400
time based and so

216
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
you could give it a list of possible

217
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,599
usernames

218
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,599
and it would time the response from the

219
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,639
server

220
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,240
and there was a large deviation

221
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,160
from the time that it took the server to

222
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
respond for valid usernames

223
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,639
versus invalid usernames and if you did

224
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,160
enough of these it could kind of start

225
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,960
to look at

226
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,199
and analyze the time for each and tell

227
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,560
you when you had identified

228
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,840
valid usernames and the usernaming

229
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,240
convention for this bank

230
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,880
was first the first initial of the first

231
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,400
name and then the last name and so i

232
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,319
essentially created a dictionary

233
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,800
of possible you know common names and

234
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,720
things that i had found on linkedin

235
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,800
and was able to identify i think close

236
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,840
to 200

237
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,919
valid usernames and from that i then

238
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,879
started doing

239
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,560
you know some targeted password guessing

240
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,639
and some credential stuffing attacks

241
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,840
and was eventually able to compromise

242
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,479
several valid

243
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,039
users and their passwords and was able

244
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:01,919
to take that

245
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,319
log into their exchange and from there

246
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,759
you know steal some data

247
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,280
and get onto their vpn portal and

248
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
eventually you know got internal access

249
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,360
and got you know privileged access and

250
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
was able to exfiltrate data and prove

251
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,520
all these really interesting things

252
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,919
and so how do i go from here to breach

253
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,039
credential lists

254
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,960
so i started to think you know there's

255
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,560
got to be a better way

256
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
than doing this time-based exchange

257
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,639
attack all the time

258
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,039
especially as people are moving to o365

259
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,039
and looking at vpn concentrators and

260
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,559
citrix environments you know you don't

261
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,159
always have the

262
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,559
that nice ability to enumerate valid

263
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,080
usernames and so

264
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,159
i started to think about all the news

265
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,440
articles that i had seen from these

266
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,279
collections and realized that i could

267
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,320
use those

268
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,519
to essentially create

269
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,839
a known username list for companies that

270
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,120
i was pen testing

271
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,720
and then i could password spray with

272
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,880
known bad passwords

273
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,800
we all know users are particularly bad

274
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,320
at setting passwords so i could use

275
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,000
things like the season and the year

276
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,600
so winter 2021 or the company name and a

277
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
number or a set of numbers

278
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,920
and using this you know fairly

279
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,440
rudimentary technique

280
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,560
gain access to email vpn

281
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,680
citrix you know vdi whatever really more

282
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,440
than half of the time and it's it's sad

283
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,680
to say and sad to see but it's a very

284
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,839
easy and very common attack

285
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,080
so about a year into doing that

286
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,360
something happened

287
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,519
and it was during a penetration test and

288
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,360
i was helping one of our junior analysts

289
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,959
who was running the test

290
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,959
and something interesting popped up as

291
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,720
he was doing his analysis of the breach

292
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,480
credentials list

293
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,040
we had written a number of scripts that

294
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
would automate much of the querying of

295
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,839
the data

296
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,480
and then the password spraying but this

297
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
potential or this uh person

298
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,000
you know being so smart and being

299
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,440
curious and having that pen tester

300
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,399
mindset

301
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,080
um wanted to do it manually and wanted

302
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,920
to see how it all worked and so

303
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,519
he was actually going through and coming

304
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,200
through the breach credentials list that

305
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,040
we had identified and the usernames and

306
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,000
passwords

307
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,240
and identified that you know half of the

308
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,480
passwords for this company

309
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,640
all were the same thing and we started

310
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,240
to think about how that might be set and

311
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,680
it wasn't a weak password it was

312
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,399
actually a quite

313
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,200
good password there was 16 characters

314
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,880
and had you know alphanumeric and

315
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,160
special characters and if

316
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,000
you know it was very odd to see that

317
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,440
many people with that

318
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,760
very unique password and what we

319
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,200
identified was there was actually a

320
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,959
trend for that organization

321
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,519
they had an i.t admin who was setting

322
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,360
new users passwords

323
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,680
to this you know really good password

324
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,360
but he set every person's password to

325
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,120
the same thing and didn't require them

326
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,800
to reset their password

327
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,399
and so what we ended up with was about

328
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,839
half the organization

329
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,440
that just stuck with this password

330
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,959
because it's what they started with

331
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,399
and they thought it was a good password

332
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,079
so they never changed it

333
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,680
and so we were able to compromise you

334
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,760
know a huge swath of people at this

335
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,200
organization

336
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,040
and it was really a training issue about

337
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
you know how to go about setting unique

338
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,800
passwords for individuals and requiring

339
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,519
resets

340
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,399
and you know it really started to be

341
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,000
kind of the next step in this kind of

342
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,839
breach credentials list attack that i

343
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,320
was using

344
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,240
so let's talk a bit about how you know

345
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,000
i've talked about the theory behind it

346
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,120
you know how i use it um and and what

347
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,800
some of the things you can do are you

348
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,240
know but you know how do you actually

349
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,160
get your hands on these things

350
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,079
because you can't just you know google

351
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,760
uh give me breach credentials you have

352
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,120
to kind of know where to look and how to

353
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,920
download it

354
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,079
so first things first you know where do

355
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:32,959
you search

356
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,959
uh so as soon as you see one of these

357
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,079
news articles come out

358
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,760
about one of these new compilations the

359
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,120
first things that i do or look on

360
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,240
torrent sites

361
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,480
things download sites like mega and then

362
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,839
some common forums and there's an

363
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,600
excellent write-up on

364
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,160
threat intel hunting at this

365
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,720
getsignal.info site

366
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,040
and i'll have a link to this later in

367
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,200
the presentation as well

368
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,839
but it talks about both some dark

369
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,320
websites and some

370
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,360
open or clear websites where you can

371
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,040
kind of go onto a forum and search for

372
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,959
some of these threads where people share

373
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,800
links for breach credential collections

374
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,360
and

375
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
you can see a few weeks ago i looked

376
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,720
here and found

377
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,639
the comb list as well as the password

378
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,800
that was set for the

379
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,320
the encrypted file that was containing

380
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,880
those sites

381
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,920
so downloading and storage so i prefer

382
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,399
to download either in an ec2 instance in

383
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,560
aws or on a vm

384
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,160
you're going on some fairly sketchy

385
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,000
forums from time to time

386
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,320
and you're going to be downloading some

387
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,040
things that

388
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,639
you know could potentially be malicious

389
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,200
so rather than using your actual host

390
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,720
i prefer to use a segmented distro

391
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,440
like ubuntu that is lightweight easily

392
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,240
trashed

393
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,360
it has a web browser but you're not you

394
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,440
know putting necessarily your host

395
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,120
at risk i also like to run my vms on one

396
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,079
of these

397
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,760
samsung t5 or t7 ssds

398
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,839
and these actually have really good read

399
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,880
and write speed

400
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,040
and are perfectly fine for running vms

401
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,959
and the reason i do that

402
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,800
is because some of these compilations

403
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,959
can be absolutely huge

404
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,600
i was running an s3 bucket in aws not

405
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,440
too long ago and had over

406
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,360
a terabyte of data of just these flat

407
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,880
text files

408
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,000
and part of the reason for that is

409
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
because these aren't de-duplicated you

410
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,000
know people

411
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,480
are just constantly adding things to

412
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,920
these lists and no one's going through

413
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
and curating and making sure that it's

414
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,399
you know unique or even valid and and

415
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,320
size is really the name of the game here

416
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,440
and so having something that you can

417
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,839
add you know add space to add you know a

418
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,440
large vm to

419
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,199
and just constantly be adding to is i

420
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,880
think really important

421
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,959
a lesson learned for everybody make sure

422
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,720
when you spin up your new vm you give

423
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,639
your vm enough hard drive space

424
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,880
to not only download these compressed

425
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,000
files but also expand the files

426
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,360
if i had a nickel for every time i

427
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,920
downloaded one of these compilations

428
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,839
and either failed the download or failed

429
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,680
when i went to expand because my vm was

430
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,600
set to like 50 gig

431
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,839
i could retire i do it literally every

432
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,279
time i did it when preparing for this

433
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:05,680
talk

434
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,079
and i will continue to do it every time

435
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,680
but if i can save you that heartache a

436
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,480
single time

437
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,000
you know i hope that helps so

438
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,839
you've gone out to to a forum you've

439
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,920
found the you know the link to a torrent

440
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,760
site or to a mega download

441
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,360
you've downloaded this and you're

442
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,800
storing it on you know

443
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,800
a samsung t5 drive or on a vm or ec2

444
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,880
you know then what do you do well you

445
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,320
could go to the cloud like i said you

446
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,000
could store it in ec2 and

447
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,800
jam it up into an s3 bucket for easy

448
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,880
querying with something like aws athena

449
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
which makes it very quick

450
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,519
and i've again dropped a link here for

451
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,360
fracture labs who has a

452
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,040
really great tutorial on how to put

453
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,399
everything up in

454
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,600
s3 and query with athena or you can

455
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
query it directly from that vm

456
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,920
which is quite frankly the easier route

457
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,040
and so

458
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,959
what i've done is dropped in i'm not

459
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,160
going to do a live demo because i don't

460
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,760
want to attempt the demo gods but

461
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,199
we have some videos here of how you can

462
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,040
actually query these breach lists

463
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,480
and some of the things that you can see

464
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
from these so

465
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,440
let's start here

466
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,199
so you can see the folder structure here

467
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,880
for the compilation of many breaches

468
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,160
has a query bash script which is

469
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,440
essentially just a

470
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,519
quick bash script to look for a specific

471
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,279
name and domain

472
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,519
and that points it to the correct folder

473
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,120
as i said the folders start with the

474
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,680
first

475
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,040
initial or the first letter of the uh

476
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,720
of the email address and so here i've

477
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,480
actually queried for one of my old email

478
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,680
addresses

479
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,800
um a good point here one of those things

480
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
was a valid password that i used about

481
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,519
10 years ago

482
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,199
before i knew anything about security

483
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,959
one of these is not a password i've ever

484
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,560
seen or used before

485
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,079
and i think that just goes to the fact

486
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,600
that you know some of this data is

487
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,040
completely

488
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,880
random or wrong it could have been

489
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,160
somebody else trying to enter my

490
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,839
username and password on a website or

491
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,199
brute force it

492
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,800
so you can only trust so much of this

493
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,360
data but you know 50

494
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,120
certainly not bad here especially for

495
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,959
for pen testing and size is the name of

496
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,399
the game so we're going to try to query

497
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,160
as much data as we can

498
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,079
and so this is just one way you can use

499
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,519
these files

500
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,600
querying for a very specific username

501
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,360
and email

502
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,720
so that'd be great if you're just going

503
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,639
to look about you know maybe yourself or

504
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,000
your friends and family to try to make

505
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,680
sure that they're not using

506
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,480
a password that's weak or still using an

507
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,800
old password that's been breached

508
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,639
but as pen testers we need to go beyond

509
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,079
that right we can't just query for a

510
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,519
single person

511
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,440
it would take all day so you know

512
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,079
there's a kind of a better way to query

513
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,279
and that is by domain and so here

514
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,720
we'll do the same thing we'll go into

515
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
the data directory of this compilation

516
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,160
of many breaches

517
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,800
and we'll just run an ls to show the

518
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,240
directory structure

519
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,399
and then we'll run just a fairly simple

520
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,680
grep and i'm going to

521
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,759
search for blockbuster.com hopefully no

522
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,079
one's still working for blockbuster

523
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,839
and what you'll see is it will iterate

524
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,240
through all these files

525
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,919
and look for usernames that have that at

526
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,079
blockbuster.com

527
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,400
domain and you can tell i mean this has

528
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,199
only

529
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,280
been 10 seconds but it's already finding

530
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
just a huge number

531
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,679
of blockbuster.com emails and passwords

532
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,720
that have been associated with those

533
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,240
and i won't let this run because it

534
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,000
takes you know like i said about five

535
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,760
minutes to go through all of these by

536
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,319
doing it through this vm

537
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,160
but you can see here you know we've got

538
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,000
lots of email addresses lots of

539
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,480
passwords that we could potentially try

540
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,160
some of these are you know most

541
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,760
definitely old

542
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,600
but some of these could well be still

543
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,360
valid and if nothing else you have a

544
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,559
starting point for your password

545
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,679
spraying attempts

546
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,240
because you have a list of usernames

547
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,640
but like i said you can take it a step

548
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,000
further

549
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,960
and after i ran this on blockbuster.com

550
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,559
i actually saved everything to a results

551
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,520
folder

552
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,760
and saved it to a text file and if we

553
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,600
just cap that file

554
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,360
what you can see is there's actually a

555
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,960
trend that's emerged here and

556
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,600
you know this is only the second company

557
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
that i ran this on as i was doing my

558
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,320
demo

559
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,600
you can see blockbuster one appears

560
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,559
several times and so if you go back and

561
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,600
cap this again

562
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,160
and do a grep for just that password of

563
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,440
all the results that we got for

564
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,559
blockbuster

565
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,799
we got you know probably 20 or 30

566
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,160
different usernames

567
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,200
that have the password of blockbuster1

568
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
and you know could this be coincidence

569
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,880
and users were just setting bad

570
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,440
passwords for their blockbuster accounts

571
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,400
sure absolutely um but what it could

572
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,240
also mean is that there was a

573
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,640
a poor practice by the i.t admins or the

574
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,200
help desk or you know maybe even hr for

575
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,160
onboarding

576
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,799
where they were allowing people to you

577
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,360
know

578
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,520
start in the organization with this bad

579
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,080
password and keep the bad password

580
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,240
and not reset it once they started and

581
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,120
so

582
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,400
you know it's unfortunate but we see

583
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,200
this all the time with organizations

584
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
and you can almost always find a trend

585
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,039
like this and if you go back and

586
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,919
password guess

587
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,679
this password against every user that

588
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,360
you find either in a breach credential

589
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,000
list or in linkedin scraping

590
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,440
you know much of the time you'll be

591
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,520
successful in compromising at least one

592
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,559
account and getting into something like

593
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:19,039
o365 or a vdi

594
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,919
or even vpn

595
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,280
so what's next so you've analyzed your

596
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,000
organization

597
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,240
or yourself for your testing targets

598
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
you've enumerated a list of possible

599
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,679
usernames and passwords

600
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,600
and you've identified you know maybe

601
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,360
some cool password trends maybe it's

602
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,880
blockbuster one maybe it's something

603
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,000
different

604
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,840
um and then you know you're gonna cr

605
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,600
either conduct credential stuffing or

606
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,240
targeted password guessing attacks which

607
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,919
is a whole talk in and of itself so i

608
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,360
won't get into those but there's lots of

609
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,799
tools out there to do it or you could

610
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,440
even do it manually

611
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,360
and then you know you may run into

612
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,120
things like multi-factor authentication

613
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,720
and i've had many clients who have told

614
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,520
me that

615
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,919
you know everything i've talked to about

616
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,360
or everything i've talked about up to

617
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,720
this point in the presentation

618
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,840
doesn't really matter because they've

619
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,919
got an mfa deployed or multi-factor

620
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:08,880
authentication

621
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,080
and unfortunately um that that it isn't

622
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,039
always the case right

623
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,799
either organizations haven't deployed

624
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,720
mfa or their mfa is weak

625
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,679
um just last week we had in you know a

626
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,720
pen test

627
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,400
an organization who fell victim to

628
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,159
credential stuffing attacks using this

629
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,520
exact attack path

630
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,760
and they felt that they were protected

631
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,880
because they had mfa

632
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,480
unfortunately their multi-factor

633
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,559
authentication enrollment portal

634
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,240
was facing the internet and they had

635
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,760
several users who hadn't

636
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
yet enrolled and what that allowed my

637
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,120
team to do was

638
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,720
simply use the valid username and

639
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,240
password that we found

640
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,799
register our phone numbers for that

641
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,840
account

642
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,480
register rmfa token and we had a

643
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,320
completely valid account and it looked

644
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,919
completely valid to the organization

645
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,080
because it was tied to a phone

646
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,880
so that's just to say you know this is

647
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,640
going to continue to be a problem for

648
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
organizations moving forward

649
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,919
and so you know the more we can do to

650
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,760
help organizations get better

651
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,640
by sharing this knowledge and you know

652
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
demonstrating the ways that password

653
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,080
and breach credentials can be used

654
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,679
against organizations

655
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,720
i think is really important

656
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,960
um so i've dropped some useful resources

657
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
here uh the first three are things that

658
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,919
i talked about

659
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,120
during the kind of past few slides um

660
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
the last one i think is really important

661
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,960
um what i've talked about today is

662
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,440
really

663
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,520
the process by which you can go through

664
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,039
and actually collect these types of

665
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,400
credentials

666
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,080
there are a lot of tools out there that

667
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,480
will automate all of that there are also

668
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,159
third party

669
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,240
paid providers and some free services

670
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,400
that will allow you to directly query

671
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,080
these types of breach credentials

672
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,240
without actually collecting them

673
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
um but just like everything else in

674
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,520
infosec i think it's so much more

675
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,880
meaningful if you go through it the

676
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,520
first time

677
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,000
and actually manually do some of these

678
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,760
steps and manually collect the

679
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,120
credentials so that you know where

680
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
they're coming from

681
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,559
the format they're in you know how dirty

682
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,240
some of the data can be

683
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,320
and you know how you can better use it

684
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,400
so you know i would i would advise you

685
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,080
and this goes for breach credentials and

686
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,840
everything else in infosec before you

687
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,039
skip to

688
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,520
kind of the easy button the easy mode

689
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,480
and and run

690
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,240
you know directly into a tool that can

691
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,760
automate everything

692
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,280
go through it once and just kind of see

693
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,120
how it all works before you go that

694
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,559
route and that way i think you have a

695
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,919
better appreciation

696
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,240
for you know all the work that goes into

697
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,120
collecting those

698
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,679
and you know how awful it can be to find

699
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,120
some of these trends manually

700
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,960
cool so we're going to switch now

701
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,679
to my other passion so this is bourbon

702
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,280
and becoming the whiskey guy

703
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,520
and this is my actual whiskey shelf in

704
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,120
my house i have about 100 bottles of

705
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,559
bourbon right now

706
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,400
and i've been collecting for about two

707
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,039
years so we are going to

708
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,960
take a quick second and if you do have

709
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,200
any bourbon or whiskey or wine or water

710
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,559
or coffee whatever you know i'd

711
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,760
encourage you

712
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,080
to uh to pour yourself a glass and maybe

713
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,200
you know follow along

714
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
so

715
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,480
so first things first um kind of what is

716
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,039
bourbon

717
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,440
and how do we understand the whiskies of

718
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,640
the world because

719
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,679
the bourbon i think is really

720
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,840
misunderstood as are many whiskeys

721
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,320
and so i i have this really great chart

722
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,080
that i've shared here

723
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
and it outlines the difference between

724
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,480
bourbons irish whiskeys canadian

725
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,120
whiskeys

726
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,760
ryes scotches you know there's a lot out

727
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,440
there in the whiskey world and these are

728
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,520
all very unique and different and

729
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,200
bourbon in particular is uniquely

730
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,000
american

731
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,039
and has some very strict laws on what

732
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,039
makes a bourbon a bourbon

733
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,279
versus maybe just an american whiskey or

734
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,440
a scotch

735
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,520
so i wanted to talk just briefly about

736
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,360
you know what is bourbon and why does it

737
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,240
really matter

738
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,200
so bourbon is a barrel-aged distilled

739
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,919
liquor

740
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,640
made from corn and you'll hear that corn

741
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,400
kind of theme continue to pop up

742
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,080
people think that you know bourbon is

743
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,799
um american in a lot of ways because it

744
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,960
is bourbon has to be made in america

745
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
but it's also you know uniquely american

746
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,799
because the united states congress

747
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,240
actually passed a bill

748
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,120
years ago making you know a set of very

749
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,880
legal requirements for what

750
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,720
bourbon has to be and it's one of the

751
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,919
few things that

752
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,799
you know in the 1800s had a you know the

753
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,120
fda essentially was regulating what

754
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,880
could go into bourbon and what couldn't

755
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,320
go into bourbon

756
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,279
and so bourbon has to be at least 51

757
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,159
corn

758
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,559
um and that mixture of the different

759
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,159
grains that go into it is called the

760
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,760
mash bill and we'll talk about that as

761
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,799
well

762
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,880
bourbon must be produced in the u.s it

763
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,039
must be stored in a charred new oak

764
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,080
barrel

765
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,960
it must be distilled to no more than 160

766
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,240
proof which is

767
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,520
proof is something we'll talk about as

768
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,200
well which is the percent of alcohol

769
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,480
that it is

770
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,240
it must enter the barrel at no more than

771
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,600
125 proof

772
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,760
and it must be bottled at more than 80

773
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,440
proof and those things are all very

774
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,120
important and we'll talk about why here

775
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,678
just shortly

776
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,840
but bourbon is so much more than just

777
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,760
those things and it is for me

778
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,320
especially you know i talked about

779
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,840
collections and bourbon for me is

780
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,600
something to hunt

781
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,840
and something to enjoy and experience

782
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,200
something to relax with

783
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,880
and and most importantly for me is

784
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,200
something to share

785
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,000
my brother my family my friends you know

786
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,679
there's nothing we enjoy

787
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,600
quite like sitting down and having a

788
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,679
glass of urban and sharing stories and

789
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:34,559
being together

790
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,320
and you know the last year with covid

791
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,400
has has really accentuated that

792
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,919
and bourbon has been a nice escape

793
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,520
whether it's over zoom

794
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,600
um you know in person in the rare

795
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,960
occasion where we can make that happen

796
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,080
safely

797
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,799
um you know it's really been kind of

798
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,360
that

799
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,520
that pressure release valve for me to be

800
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,039
able to have a moment

801
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,400
and take take time away from the

802
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,559
computer and from the zoo meetings

803
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,159
and just be with friends and so you know

804
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,360
bourbon over the last year has

805
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,320
definitely been something that's

806
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,879
important to me

807
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,120
so why collect bourbon you know right i

808
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,240
could just go to the store

809
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,919
get a bottle of bourbon drink it for a

810
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,000
few weeks uh when i'm done with it go

811
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,520
get another one

812
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
but to me bourbon you know there's some

813
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,679
element of the thrill of the chase

814
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,679
um if you've been following bourbon or

815
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,360
if you're familiar with whiskey at all

816
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,039
in the u.s there's been this boom over

817
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,640
the last 10 years

818
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,559
and what we're seeing is a number of

819
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,080
kind of limited releases

820
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,320
and you know older bourbons and what we

821
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,919
call dusty bottles things that have been

822
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,440
on the shelf for years that

823
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,200
maybe weren't popular 10 years ago but

824
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,120
are getting popular now and

825
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,440
there's emerge this whole community

826
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,520
similar to the infosec community that's

827
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,600
that's all about sharing information and

828
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,640
sharing reviews

829
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,840
and and making bourbon and the community

830
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,880
of bourbon bigger

831
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,200
and so whiskey dfw is a subreddit that i

832
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
follow

833
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,840
and it's a daily occurrence that you'll

834
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,440
see somebody saying something like who's

835
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,799
out hunting today or

836
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,480
or sharing where they found a specific

837
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,159
bottle that everyone's looking for

838
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,080
and you know what liquor store it's at

839
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,520
who to ask about it and

840
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,039
you know how many bottles are left at a

841
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,640
specific time

842
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,720
and it's become this you know kind of

843
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,799
this hobby that can really

844
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,480
grab a hold of you and take a lot of

845
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,840
time and so with that

846
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,760
i'll you know issue a caution or a

847
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,520
warning if you're going to get into the

848
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,880
bourbon community and you're going to

849
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,440
start collecting be careful

850
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,600
it can get expensive it can also take a

851
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,360
lot of time there are definitely people

852
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,520
out there that spend

853
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,919
a good deal of time looking for and

854
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,520
buying bourbon

855
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,880
some don't even drink it you know

856
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,480
there's there's a secondary market

857
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,919
that's emerged where

858
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,440
people are reselling some of these

859
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,840
bottles um even the bottles behind me

860
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,880
for you know 3x or 4x price

861
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,919
because people are such so interested in

862
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,159
buying these rare bourbons

863
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,640
so i'll start with this you know you you

864
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,320
don't have to search

865
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,720
high and low or find you know this rare

866
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,520
bottle

867
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
or a specific type of bourbon to find a

868
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,840
great bourbon that you'll enjoy

869
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,399
and so you know you go into the liquor

870
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,120
store

871
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,720
and it can be intimidating if you're not

872
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,159
a bourbon person you're not a whiskey

873
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,279
person

874
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,960
you see this wall of 200 bourbons

875
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,279
how do you select one so i wanted to

876
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,880
spend a little bit of time talking about

877
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,279
the process that i go through to select

878
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,520
a bourbon that's readily available

879
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,480
that i think i'll like and so we'll

880
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,679
start with

881
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,679
the grain mixtures or the mash bill like

882
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,960
i talked about

883
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,640
and the three things you'll start to see

884
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,320
the most in that bourbon aisle

885
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,799
is you know the word bourbon of course

886
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,200
which is because of the corn

887
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,440
a bit sweeter and more caramel like it's

888
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,799
very smooth almost a dessert drink

889
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,640
you'll also see the term rye thrown

890
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,240
around and that can either be a rye

891
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,480
whiskey or a high rye bourbon

892
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,159
and what's that you know what that means

893
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,600
is there's just more rye

894
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,799
in that mash bill that mixture um

895
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,200
maybe you know close to fifty percent or

896
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,159
even over fifty percent in a true rye

897
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,399
and that rye grain brings out a spicier

898
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,360
and more savo

899
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,320
savory flavor and if you're not used to

900
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,919
drinking bourbon or whiskey's that can

901
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:06,720
come across

902
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,440
as a bit more alcohol forward or hot

903
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,520
and so i would you know maybe warn you

904
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,120
if you're new to bourbon maybe don't

905
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,799
start with a rye but instead start with

906
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,320
something that's a high wheat

907
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,640
content because that comes across as

908
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,080
more smooth and mellow

909
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,799
and maker's mark is a great example of a

910
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,559
high wheat bourbon that

911
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,480
it was very easy on the palate very easy

912
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,799
to drink and obviously readily available

913
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,399
so proof is the next big thing that i

914
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,480
think a lot of people make the mistake

915
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,919
of when they get into bourbon the lower

916
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,480
proof and this is alcohol content

917
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,960
lower proof is most of the bottles on

918
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,399
the shelf

919
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,080
lower proof is usually between 80 and

920
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,720
90. it's a mellow taste and easy to

921
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,600
drink

922
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,080
whether it's neat or on the rocks or you

923
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,080
know mixed with whatever you want

924
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,840
it's easy and approachable for a new

925
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,120
bourboner

926
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
but as you continue down your bourbon

927
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,360
journey and you've started to

928
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,520
you know have develop a palette for

929
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,039
bourbon and for whiskey

930
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,600
most people find themselves shifting

931
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,039
into

932
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,279
either bottle and bond or barrel proof

933
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,159
and bottle and bond is exactly 100 proof

934
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,120
so it's exactly 50 alcohol and it

935
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,960
legally has to be this way and the

936
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,480
bottle and bond act was something that

937
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,640
was passed in the u.s

938
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,240
that again put even stricter

939
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,559
requirements on what bourbon

940
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,159
had to be and so if you see a bottle

941
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,159
we'll start to pull back here if you see

942
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,080
a bottle like this that actually says

943
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,200
bottle and bond on it there are legal

944
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,120
mandates on what that means

945
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,120
and so when you anytime you get a bottle

946
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,679
of bourbon that has that bottle and bond

947
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,880
labeling on it

948
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,480
you know it has to be exactly 100 proof

949
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,480
and it's what's going to come with that

950
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,000
100 proof is a little bit more

951
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,600
complexity because it's

952
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,279
a little bit less watered down out of

953
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,279
the barrel and that makes it a

954
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,840
a great choice for cocktails without you

955
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,320
know

956
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,159
losing the complexity when you're mixing

957
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,600
it it also makes

958
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,080
for a very great neat drink as you're

959
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,880
getting

960
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,840
more accustomed to drinking whiskey how

961
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,240
to drink whiskey how to enjoy it

962
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,679
and also developing your palette

963
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,559
the next step up from there is what

964
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,559
you'll see referred to as either barrel

965
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,279
proof

966
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,640
or cask strength or full proof

967
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,840
and these are the highest proof bourbons

968
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,880
out there and these are often 110 proof

969
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,240
this is 122 proof these are not

970
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,080
significantly watered down after being

971
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
aged in the barrel

972
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,159
so these come with a ton of flavor a ton

973
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,600
of complexity

974
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,440
but they're not for the faint of heart

975
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,120
so if you're just getting into whiskey

976
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,799
you're just getting into bourbon

977
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,360
one of the big mistakes i see is people

978
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
read reviews from people that you know

979
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
do nothing but drink bourbon

980
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,919
and they they get pointed towards

981
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,600
something like a barrel proof or a full

982
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,720
proof and they get it

983
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,640
and like the guy in the picture they're

984
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,840
breathing fire and

985
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,000
it turns them away from bourbon and it

986
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,519
you know it's it's awful to see

987
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,559
because they just picked the wrong thing

988
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,320
and it's not where they should you know

989
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,000
maybe start they should start

990
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,519
on the lower proof rather than going

991
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,720
straight for something that's 60

992
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,320
60 alcohol right

993
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,919
the next thing that you'll see and this

994
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,080
this comes a lot with that secondary

995
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,919
market is age statements

996
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,559
so this is part of what is so romantic

997
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,600
about bourbon and

998
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,240
and why so many people are in love with

999
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,840
searching for and finding bourbon

1000
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,360
because bourbon is

1001
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,919
in many cases aged over 10 years and if

1002
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,120
you think about you know

1003
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,559
the amount of work and the amount of

1004
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,640
time and thought that goes into that

1005
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,360
process

1006
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,200
it's it's hard not to fall in love with

1007
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,840
the idea of bourbon

1008
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
um you can see back here i have a

1009
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,640
bourbon that

1010
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,159
you know very clearly says it's been

1011
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,679
aged for 10 years and

1012
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,440
these 10-year whiskeys and old are

1013
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,519
awfully often highly sought after just

1014
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,960
because of the amount of work and

1015
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,120
passion that's gone into them

1016
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,120
i'll warn you though some whiskeys are

1017
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,360
meant to look like they've been aged for

1018
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,640
a long period of time

1019
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,399
but you need to read carefully a great

1020
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,000
example is jack daniel's old number

1021
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,640
seven

1022
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,000
you know a lot of people getting into

1023
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,159
whiskey think old number seven right it

1024
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,559
has to be aged for seven years but

1025
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,880
in reality you know that's not the case

1026
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,559
it's not an age statement it's just a

1027
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,600
number on the bottle

1028
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,720
so be very careful as you look at

1029
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
bottles and at the age statements

1030
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,960
read carefully on the label because they

1031
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,080
can't legally say

1032
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,919
it's an age statement unless it is so

1033
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,360
you can start to get a lot of good

1034
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,559
information

1035
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,279
by really diving into the details um of

1036
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,120
what's on the label

1037
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
and you know again when in doubt you can

1038
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,640
go back to that bottle and bond act

1039
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,159
anything with that bottle and bond

1040
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,640
label has to legally been aged for at

1041
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,559
least four years

1042
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,159
or longer and so you know there's a

1043
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,799
minimum there and and this age again

1044
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,480
adds complexity so the longer the

1045
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,080
whiskey's been in the barrel

1046
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,919
the more seasons it's gone through and

1047
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,120
the heating and cold

1048
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,440
or the heating and cooling of the barrel

1049
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,960
um in regions like kentucky or tennessee

1050
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,440
expand and contract those barrels in the

1051
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,560
liquid

1052
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,199
and as the liquid soaks into the wood

1053
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,599
from the barrel and then back out

1054
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,320
it it just attracts more and more flavor

1055
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,440
and more complexity

1056
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,399
the last thing that i'll talk about is

1057
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,679
batches

1058
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,040
and so if you've if you've been to a

1059
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,079
liquor store and you've looked at

1060
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,199
bourbon you've seen

1061
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,918
probably labels like small batch and

1062
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:38,800
single barrel

1063
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,879
and it can be confusing right i don't a

1064
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,399
lot of people don't kind of understand

1065
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,159
what it all means and

1066
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,000
many people think that single barrel is

1067
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,280
always better than small batch and

1068
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,560
that's not always the case it really

1069
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,879
depends on what you're looking for

1070
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,839
and so a small batch is something that

1071
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,320
comes from a small selection of barrels

1072
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,480
that are mixed to achieve a consistent

1073
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,839
flavor

1074
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,680
so this elijah craig

1075
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,000
is you know just a classic small batch

1076
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,800
bourbon

1077
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,320
and it's one of the most consistent

1078
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,160
bourbons that i've found you know the

1079
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,200
the distillers are finding a way to

1080
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,800
pick specific barrels from their

1081
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,040
warehouse and each barrel has a unique

1082
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,480
flavor because of the location of the

1083
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,760
warehouse and

1084
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,000
you know the the way the weather affects

1085
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
that location in the warehouse

1086
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,760
and a good distiller is going to find a

1087
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,280
way to pick barrels from throughout the

1088
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,160
warehouse

1089
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,000
and mix them to achieve a consistent

1090
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,359
flavor

1091
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,160
on the other hand

1092
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,960
if you get something that's a single

1093
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,480
barrel it

1094
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,800
is you know each bottle comes from an

1095
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,480
individually aged barrel rather than a

1096
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:42,880
mix

1097
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,480
and so what this allows the distiller to

1098
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,880
do is to cherry pick or hand pick

1099
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,359
specific barrels that they feel taste

1100
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,880
the best and release them

1101
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,359
for a unique experience but that also

1102
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,079
comes with

1103
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,480
is a different experience for every

1104
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,920
bottle you get because every bottle

1105
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,440
might come from a different

1106
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,599
barrel and so some of these bottles you

1107
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,560
can actually see

1108
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,960
on the label will include the warehouse

1109
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,119
or the rick house that they were aged in

1110
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,079
and the location of the barrel in that

1111
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,839
rick house and so you can start to see

1112
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,960
even within

1113
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,200
the exact same bottle that was purchased

1114
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,160
you know

1115
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,680
a time you know six months apart or a

1116
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,520
year apart it might have a completely

1117
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,640
different flavor

1118
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,160
because of where it was at in the

1119
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,400
distilling process

1120
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,880
and the last thing i'll mention is

1121
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,400
single barrel select and this is one of

1122
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,920
the coolest things i think in bourbon

1123
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,920
so a single barrel select is when a

1124
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,160
group gets to select their own barrel

1125
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,720
to achieve a specific taste profile and

1126
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,320
so typically that's a liquor

1127
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,359
store that has a whiskey expert that

1128
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,560
actually gets to

1129
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,359
work directly with a distiller to taste

1130
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,880
several different barrels or even

1131
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,280
request a specific taste

1132
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,280
and gets to decide which barrel that

1133
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,960
they want to barrel and sell

1134
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,440
for their customers and some of these

1135
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,240
are also done

1136
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,960
for online communities and i mentioned

1137
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,240
you know the bourbon community

1138
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,880
is is amazing and there's actually an r

1139
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,440
bourbon subreddit

1140
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,680
that has a group of people that are able

1141
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,800
to select

1142
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,480
their own single barrel offerings and so

1143
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,800
this is an elijah craig

1144
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,720
single barrel select offering that was

1145
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,839
made specifically for the r bourbon

1146
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,000
subreddit

1147
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,760
and i was able to pick up a bottle of

1148
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,119
this and it tastes

1149
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,000
i mean drastically different than these

1150
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,880
other

1151
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,000
bottles of elijah craig

1152
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,079
and again that's just because of where

1153
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,800
it was in the warehouse as it was aged

1154
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,440
the time it was aged for and the

1155
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
specific seasons during that time period

1156
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,280
it may have been super hot or super cold

1157
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,320
one winter

1158
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,000
and that really affects the complexity

1159
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,720
and the taste of that bourbon

1160
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,520
so the last thing we'll talk about is um

1161
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,599
how to drink and that that's not

1162
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,920
completely a joke um there's a lot of

1163
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,040
people that drink bourbon

1164
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,480
incorrectly and part of what i see when

1165
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,000
people are turned away from bourbon

1166
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,079
is that they don't understand how to

1167
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,079
correctly sip a bourbon instead they're

1168
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,520
just trying to chug it

1169
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,240
um like they're back in college and

1170
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,160
trying to just get hammered and that's

1171
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,520
that's not what bourbon's all about

1172
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,040
right bourbon is about

1173
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,880
you know sipping enjoying the complexity

1174
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,240
enjoying the drink

1175
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,760
and you know being able to sit and enjoy

1176
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,920
it together with with people

1177
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,119
so you know there are lots of different

1178
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,680
glasses

1179
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,599
you can get these these small sipping

1180
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,079
glasses

1181
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,480
some that are a little bit larger um

1182
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,880
that are meant really to

1183
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,520
um help with the the aroma of the

1184
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,079
bourbon

1185
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,000
and help as you're drinking to really

1186
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,160
share that aroma

1187
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,520
i prefer just a good old

1188
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,000
highball glass i don't put a ton in

1189
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,640
there but

1190
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,240
you know you're supposed to really take

1191
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,000
small sips and not

1192
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,480
guzzle the thing down

1193
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,079
so in summary you know whether it's

1194
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,680
breach credentials

1195
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,800
bourbon whiskey scotch

1196
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,880
pokemon cards whatever it is you know

1197
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,000
find something you enjoy

1198
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,240
and dive in and that's something i've

1199
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,040
really

1200
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,839
stressed to the people that work with me

1201
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,359
or people that come to me and are asking

1202
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,040
to get into penetration testing or

1203
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,320
security

1204
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,520
is you know you can't you can't make

1205
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,079
progress

1206
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,000
if you're just thinking about the best

1207
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,599
first step you know just

1208
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,280
find something you enjoy doing and just

1209
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,359
dive right in and whether it's

1210
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,119
you know credentials bourbon you know

1211
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,400
take the first step

1212
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,000
and even if you end up you know in a

1213
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,280
year realizing that you've been moving

1214
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,560
in the wrong direction

1215
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,720
at least you've been moving and so you

1216
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,079
know that's the one piece of advice

1217
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,400
i'd give anyone starting out is just you

1218
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,880
know start moving

1219
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,640
i think we have a few minutes for

1220
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,920
questions if there's any and if you

1221
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,400
don't mind

1222
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,640
hey you have something drinks yeah take

1223
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,920
a drink and i'll

1224
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,640
queue up your questions all right so the

1225
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,680
first one

1226
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,119
um is there any legal concern

1227
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,560
and you know you can make this country

1228
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,720
specific if you want with collecting

1229
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,560
stolen credentials providing you don't

1230
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,319
use them without authorization

1231
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,800
you know i i wish i knew the answer to

1232
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,720
that i'm certainly not a lawyer

1233
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,079
so um not that i'm aware of

1234
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,400
um these are all things that are

1235
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,000
publicly available

1236
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,760
and out on the internet and assuming

1237
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,040
that you're not using them

1238
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,079
for malintent you know i

1239
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,839
i would think that it was probably okay

1240
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,400
but again i'm not a lawyer yeah we

1241
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,000
neither of us is a lawyer

1242
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,200
we don't play one on tv so yeah yeah

1243
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,599
um the next question is about bourbon

1244
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,280
and whiskey in the whiskey community

1245
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,800
there's often a disgust

1246
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,280
for bourbon i don't understand this do

1247
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,880
you have any insight to why that is

1248
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,480
i didn't know there was such a disgust

1249
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,240
for bourbon um

1250
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,280
this is news to me i'm devastated me too

1251
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,640
is that the international whiskey

1252
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,480
community because i could see that

1253
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,720
yeah maybe maybe the question asker will

1254
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,839
clarify this

1255
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,000
um yeah the next question

1256
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,800
is very specific so i don't know if

1257
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,319
you're gonna have a guess at this one

1258
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,440
um are there any credential dumps you

1259
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,920
you know of available of pin numbers

1260
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,560
from

1261
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,319
the asia region asking because there's a

1262
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,640
research project ongoing

1263
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,400
i would have to do some research i would

1264
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,800
i would definitely point you back to

1265
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
that blog post that i shared around the

1266
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,119
threat intelligence hunting

1267
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,680
just about everything that i've ever

1268
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,119
sought to research

1269
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,520
i've been able to find a good thread

1270
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,560
through one of those

1271
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,200
kind of platforms there's always someone

1272
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,880
that's kind of looking at the same thing

1273
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,319
as you even if it's not for the same

1274
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:46,800
purpose

1275
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,079
you know there's so much good

1276
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,920
information out there that i would point

1277
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,760
you back to that link into that thread

1278
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,119
intel hunting

1279
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,839
awesome uh your commenter about the

1280
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,839
whiskey versus bourbon thing has

1281
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,599
mentioned that that is an international

1282
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,599
non-us thing so

1283
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,079
um might be something not visible to us

1284
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,520
in the united states

1285
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,920
right yeah that's that's interesting

1286
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,520
yeah interesting you'll have to you'll

1287
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:09,920
have to

1288
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,720
explain to me after and the chat will

1289
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,319
still be running so if people want to

1290
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:15,440
ask you more questions

1291
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,040
um are there any more questions i don't

1292
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,000
see any more in the chat

1293
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,880
there's a there's 11 people typing right

1294
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,240
now so oh

1295
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,839
they might be debating about bourbon

1296
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,400
versus whiskey

1297
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,240
it just says several people are typing

1298
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,480
now yeah and and i can see the

1299
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,680
international part right

1300
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,440
because it's you know the us is a

1301
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,119
younger place and whiskey

1302
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,960
bourbon in particular is much newer than

1303
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,800
things like scotch so i can definitely

1304
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,400
see that it's just doesn't have the

1305
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,720
the international following okay a

1306
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,920
couple more questions so

1307
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,319
uh do you have a personal favorite right

1308
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,400
now bourbon

1309
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,839
i i do um so

1310
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,960
i don't have it with me i've got so many

1311
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,400
favorites

1312
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,440
so i actually just found a new one and i

1313
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,880
am out of it so a very affordable

1314
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,480
and easy to find bourbon is from redwood

1315
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,720
empire and i'll paste a link in the chat

1316
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,640
later they also have a mix

1317
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,680
of bourbon and rye that is

1318
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,359
amazing and the labels on them are

1319
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,960
really really cool and some awesome

1320
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,240
artwork

1321
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,000
but it's what i've been going to as kind

1322
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,560
of my easy you know daily drinker that

1323
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,400
you can always find in the liquor store

1324
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,960
so i'll post a link for that cool and i

1325
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,560
think one we've got time for one last

1326
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,359
question

1327
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,599
do you put together breach credentials

1328
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,599
in your own personal database for

1329
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,440
for quick searches and how do you do

1330
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,960
that

1331
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,480
yeah so i posted a link to a

1332
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,160
tutorial about how to move everything to

1333
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,680
the cloud we didn't have time to get

1334
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,040
into it but that's actually what i've

1335
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,000
done

1336
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,680
is i've started collecting all these

1337
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,079
breach compilations and pushing them all

1338
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,359
to s3

1339
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,200
and you actually don't push them to a

1340
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,400
traditional database

1341
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,680
because it's it's very um kind of dirty

1342
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,520
data the formatting is not perfect

1343
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,079
but you there's a way to use s3 as

1344
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,119
essentially an unrelational database

1345
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,839
and query it directly with aws athena

1346
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:12,400
and that

1347
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,079
that link that i posted and i'll post it

1348
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,760
in the chat as well has a really good

1349
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,520
tutorial on how to do that

1350
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,200
and it also saves a lot of money because

1351
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,680
like i said the size of these can get

1352
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,480
really unwieldy i think i have a

1353
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,160
terabyte or two terabytes up there right

1354
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,960
now

1355
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,280
um and the the querying could also take

1356
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,720
a long time so i'm able to get through

1357
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,839
that query in about

1358
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,520
i think four minutes even running it

1359
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,560
through you know over a terabyte

1360
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
awesome well thanks for sharing both of

1361
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,160
your very interesting talks with us

1362
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,119
today we

1363
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,480
can see from the chat that people are

1364
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,839
very engaged and have a lot more

1365
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,200
comments and discussion they want to

1366
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:45,839
have with you

1367
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,839

1369
