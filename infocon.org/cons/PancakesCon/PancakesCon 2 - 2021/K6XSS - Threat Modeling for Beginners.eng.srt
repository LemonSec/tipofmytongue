1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,360
good morning everybody um yeah so first

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,240
off we're gonna talk about an

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,480
introduction to threat modeling

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,240
uh just a little bit about me my name is

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,240
greg horton pronounced he him

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,679
uh for the last two years i've been

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,759
doing product security at slack

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,599
i'm responsible for launching our

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,199
security champions program

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,279
and our threat modeling project

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,199
previously i was a web developer

12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,439
qa engineer devops engineer bicycle

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,640
mechanic

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,800
and i've also been known to do security

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,000
trainings for activists from time to

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,800
time

17
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,599
my current pandemic passions uh first

18
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,920
off ham radio as you can see i have a

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,239
fancy antenna and a chair i went and sat

20
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,079
on a hill for a whole day and talked to

21
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,800
people who were far away and gardening

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,680
you know i just

23
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,920
i like to grow food and i found this

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,760
week i found a banana you can grow in

25
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,120
places that are that

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,200
get frost so look it up it's called an

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,320
ice cream banana if you want to grow

28
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,399
bananas

29
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,039
um first off let's talk what is threat

30
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:55,600
modeling

31
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,120
you may may have heard this term before

32
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,160
you don't exactly know what it means

33
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,680
it's easy to define it as a method for

34
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,280
identifying communicating and

35
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,040
understanding threats and mitigations

36
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,320
to protect something of value

37
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,400
and what does a threat model look like

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,520
so a threat model is going to be a

39
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,200
living document that you have

40
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,080
that outlines a system lists the risks

41
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,439
and comes up with mitigations to be

42
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,560
implemented

43
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,479
um and this will be for reference for

44
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,159
when things go wrong so you'll keep this

45
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,159
document around you'll change it you'll

46
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,439
modify it it shouldn't be something that

47
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,439
you just do once and then

48
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,720
put on a shelf and leave alone

49
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,079
and why bother doing any of this because

50
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,159
uh when you're well caffeinated and well

51
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,680
slept and you're doing stuff in the

52
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,640
middle of the day

53
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,079
it's a lot easier to think about what

54
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,079
could go wrong and how to fix it

55
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,520
than being woken up in the middle of the

56
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,000
night and not know what's going wrong

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,920
so and dealing with it at that point

58
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,720
so we want to figure out things to go

59
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,159
going wrong before they actually go

60
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,520
wrong

61
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,159
so it's it's the first day of spring

62
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,040
yesterday

63
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,880
it's gonna get warmer let's go camping

64
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,399
you know who likes camping i love

65
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,360
camping

66
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,799
i'm gonna be doing some of it this

67
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,479
summer so

68
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,959
you know you you it's really fun you get

69
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,399
to make s'mores you get to have a

70
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,920
campfire you get to lay in a tent it's

71
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,520
beautiful

72
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,160
but when you go camping you always want

73
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,520
to think about what can go wrong because

74
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,800
you know

75
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,959
the store may be miles away you're

76
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,160
definitely not at home you don't have

77
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,520
your creature comforts you don't have a

78
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,800
shower

79
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
and so what can go wrong when it when

80
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,879
you go camping well it could rain

81
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,840
it's always a bummer you get attacked by

82
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,959
mosquitoes

83
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,560
or a friendly bear could come to your

84
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,400
camp and uh

85
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,760
and eat all your food so

86
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,840
threat modeling is just anticipating

87
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,920
risk and mitigating for it

88
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,400
so when you go camping you anticipate

89
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,200
for

90
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,720
rain you check the weather reports you

91
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,720
anticipate for mosquitoes you bring

92
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,120
bug spray and for bears we can threat

93
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,160
model for them too

94
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,599
you know we can hang our food up in

95
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,680
trees we can keep our kitchen areas away

96
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,319
from our campsites

97
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,599
we can do all these things to make sure

98
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,920
that our camping experience is nice and

99
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,800
lovely and

100
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
and doesn't and doesn't get ruined by by

101
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,840
a bear uh

102
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,879
you know tearing open our car

103
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,800
and the main point here that i'm making

104
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,239
about threat modeling is that everybody

105
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,760
actually threat models already

106
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,159
um it's just we need to make it into a

107
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,040
process for

108
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,200
for security of a rep replicable

109
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,480
and um and consistent

110
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,760
so parents if anybody here is a parent

111
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,519
you know that you threat model

112
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,000
you have that new baby starting to walk

113
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
what are you doing

114
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,200
drilling everything to the wall putting

115
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
things in the plugs making sure

116
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,080
everything's put away making sure knifes

117
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,440
aren't on the counter

118
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,200
you know simple little things to make

119
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,720
sure that your child stays safe

120
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,239
you're constantly thinking about what

121
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,080
what those risks are in mitigating them

122
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
space travel you know you're stuck in a

123
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,000
in a space capsule you need to know

124
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,080
uh what can go wrong what can you do

125
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,200
about it

126
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,519
and crash testing this is a form of

127
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,720
threat modeling as well

128
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,560
you know the companies who make our

129
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
automobiles crash them

130
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,319
make sure how to make them safer and do

131
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,840
it all over again you know

132
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,200
and that's that can be a form of threat

133
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,760
modeling big takeaway here is

134
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,480
threat modeling helps prevent incidents

135
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,799
it's

136
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,200
better to think about what can go wrong

137
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,199
and solve for it than to

138
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,478
be in the situation where it's going

139
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,880
wrong actively that's all

140
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,720
so let's talk about how to threat model

141
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,280
this is a pretty simple method here that

142
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,880
that i like that comes out of the oauth

143
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,720
but modeling guide

144
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,639
there are all kinds of philosophies

145
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,000
around threat modeling and you can get

146
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
really really complicated with it if

147
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,280
this is something that's your passion

148
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,800
go for it read about it but i think for

149
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
most most people we can start with these

150
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,160
four points and go from there

151
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,000
so we're gonna talk about what what are

152
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
we working on

153
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,320
what could go wrong what are we gonna do

154
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,440
about it

155
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,400
and then then then talk about did we do

156
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,759
a good job

157
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,520
first off what are we working on you

158
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,000
know what what are the details

159
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
so you want to outline your system you

160
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,199
want to identify any

161
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,280
tangible assets if any so when you're

162
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,199
starting your threat modeling process

163
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:09,680
you

164
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,880
you can bring in whoever the

165
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,520
stakeholders are and do this process

166
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,000
live um or if you're working more alone

167
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,120
you can

168
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,280
do it asynchronously about asking okay

169
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,520
what systems do we have to look at

170
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,039
if you're at a smaller company maybe

171
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,800
it's just you know a web server a

172
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,600
database

173
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,360
a web application etc but if it's

174
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
somewhere larger you're gonna need

175
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,919
um you know large architecture diagrams

176
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,680
and and understanding multiple systems

177
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,479
and how they all

178
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,160
fit together you want to know how the

179
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,520
system is built and this can be the

180
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
basics it's like

181
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,800
what programming language are you using

182
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,479
uh what frameworks are you using what

183
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,360
kind of database is

184
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,479
how are things updated um then you want

185
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,360
to obtain the

186
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,000
the architecture diagrams or often times

187
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,039
you're going to have to make them

188
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,039
you know they the teams may not have

189
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,720
made architecture diagrams when building

190
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,680
their systems

191
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,880
they all know it in their heads but

192
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,479
they've never actually written it down

193
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,160
and your responsibility as the person

194
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
who's doing the threat model is to say

195
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,639
okay here are our here's our um our

196
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,199
system and

197
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,120
here's what it looks like because again

198
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,319
as i reference at the beginning of the

199
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,600
talk you want to be able to reference

200
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,400
this document

201
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,680
when things go wrong um and so having it

202
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,280
be the source of truth for what things

203
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,000
look like

204
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,160
is really really useful then you want to

205
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,600
think about how does data flow through

206
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,400
the system

207
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,240
if i'm a user on your site and i type my

208
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,520
password into a box

209
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,919
where does it go who what what systems

210
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:28,960
does it touch

211
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,039
does it does it go through things that i

212
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,400
wouldn't expect

213
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,199
you'll want to know that um and what's

214
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,560
in and out of scope for this model

215
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,280
that's

216
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,400
probably one of the most important

217
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
things is that you can get really really

218
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,759
into the weeds with threat modeling

219
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,039
and you can talk about things that are

220
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,199
never going to be relevant uh you know

221
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,479
most of us host things in aws is

222
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,680
aws going down in our threat model maybe

223
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,520
you know depends on depends on on what

224
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,800
you're working with but

225
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,039
you know you want to think about what's

226
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,479
in and out of scope for your model

227
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,319
i would say for for most models you want

228
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,000
to make the scope as as tight as

229
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,440
possible at first and you can always

230
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,599
expand it later

231
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,199
so then you know you have everything

232
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,960
laid out you know what you're working on

233
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
you know you know the the elements the

234
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,720
architecture et cetera now you get to do

235
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,479
the fun stuff and think like a bad actor

236
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,759
you know you get to be the the hacker

237
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,039
of your dreams so i like to use the

238
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,319
stride method when thinking about what

239
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,120
can go wrong

240
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,360
and this is um a method developed from

241
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,160
microsoft

242
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,360
and popularized by adam shostak

243
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,520
and it talks about the stride method and

244
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,680
this is a way of categorizing

245
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,759
threats into different buckets so you

246
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,800
can

247
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,479
better find and identify them and then

248
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,919
also it gives you a template

249
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,720
of like how to think of new things so we

250
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,120
have spoofing of user identity

251
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,080
tampering of data uh repudiation which

252
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,000
is the denial of truth or validity of

253
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,400
something

254
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,440
this is in relationship to logging

255
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,199
information disclosure like a privacy

256
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,479
breach to data leak

257
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,960
a denial of service everybody's favorite

258
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,319
then elevation of privilege

259
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,240
like a regular user being elevated to an

260
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,360
admin user

261
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,080
taking this the stride method to look at

262
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,879
your risks

263
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,360
gives you a good template to say okay do

264
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,919
we have any

265
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,240
examples of tampering oh yeah i remember

266
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,759
that this part

267
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,120
piece of data in this system can get

268
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,039
tampered in this way and you can go

269
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,080
go from there to to drill down and and

270
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,039
find all those risks

271
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,360
so we have a a big old system

272
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,680
we have everything that can go wrong now

273
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,960
we get to say what are we going to do

274
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,759
about it

275
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,120
you know it's it's great to find out

276
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,360
what's wrong but with a threat model you

277
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,399
want you want to

278
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,640
bring it full circle and figure out what

279
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,200
what the mitigations can be

280
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,640
so attack scenarios you want to outline

281
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,480
what it's going to look like so you come

282
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,040
up with with some

283
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,880
things that can go wrong outline how it

284
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,240
could go wrong

285
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,839
then you want to determine the risk so

286
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,279
this is about like likelihood and

287
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,320
severity

288
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
which below i have a little chart that i

289
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,760
that i like to reference

290
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,839
uh when i'm doing my own threat modeling

291
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,680
if something is improbable but

292
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
if it happened it was catastrophic in

293
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,519
this

294
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,040
and this chart that would be a medium

295
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,440
for example um and this may change with

296
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,600
with your um with your work and in

297
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,040
whatever systems you're working with you

298
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,839
have to be the

299
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,200
the one to call it but um people also

300
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,120
use cvss scores

301
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,399
uh to determine risk but um

302
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,959
yeah any type of risk determining is

303
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,160
going to get you to a point where you

304
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,959
can

305
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,600
categorize your your risks and your

306
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,240
mitigations and prioritize them

307
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
you want to outline the mitigation steps

308
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,680
with the timeline for remediation

309
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,120
i think it's always important that you

310
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,880
can come up with how to fix something

311
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,600
and then

312
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,680
give the people working on the system

313
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,040
and the developers

314
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,880
sort of a time frame of which you think

315
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
of like how long will this take them so

316
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,640
they can prioritize it

317
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,760
and then i always like to file the

318
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,519
mitigations in a bug tracking system

319
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,360
just throw it right into jira

320
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,839
get somebody to to to track it and so

321
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,600
that it actually gets done because

322
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,120
it's a great thing to come up with all

323
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,200
these these problems and all these

324
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,040
solutions but if nobody fixes it what's

325
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,880
the point

326
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,440
so let's talk about uh likelihood and

327
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,880
severity for a second

328
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,640
so as you know i'm going to be talking

329
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,959
about the international space station

330
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,440
so we know that bears can invade you

331
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,760
when you're camping but like

332
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,760
bears on the space station well

333
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,720
i mean maybe maybe there could be bears

334
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,000
on the space station

335
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,959
see i looked this up i was like i wonder

336
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,240
if there's ever been a bear on the space

337
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,959
station and

338
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,360
lo and behold smokey has been on the

339
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,480
space station

340
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,920
so likelihood high likelihood

341
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,240
is this catastrophic well if it was a

342
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,160
grizzly bear yes it'd be catastrophic

343
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,320
but i think i think smokey can handle it

344
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,680
on the iss i don't think we need to

345
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,880
really worry about that's risk

346
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,320
so here's an example of a um attack

347
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,360
scenario

348
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,480
that would be featured in the threat

349
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,839
model so say we're running an ecommerce

350
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,480
website and our

351
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
tax scenario is that people can use our

352
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
system to buy things that aren't

353
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,640
released yet

354
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,079
so you know you're sitting around you're

355
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,760
waiting for that new album

356
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,160
and you can just go to the url and find

357
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,040
it and

358
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,120
it's not released for another month and

359
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,040
in our system let's say it's probable

360
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,720
and it would be a critical vulnerability

361
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
for us

362
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,399
so our mitigation steps are put role

363
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,279
limits on

364
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,040
unreleased product endpoints so only

365
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,800
make sure that admins can access those

366
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
endpoints

367
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,959
and then you can limit your apis uh only

368
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,440
to

369
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
um purchase things from released

370
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,200
products say there's a database flag for

371
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,000
example

372
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,560
um for um products that that are already

373
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,360
released

374
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,959
and that if you hit the buy it now api

375
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,560
um it won't go through unless it's a

376
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,560
release product so

377
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,160
very simple example you know something

378
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,560
that you could come up with in a um

379
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,920
during a threat modeling exercise

380
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,880
so you gotta you got all your

381
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,720
architecture diagrams

382
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,560
you got your your risks you got some

383
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,720
mitigations now you want to look at did

384
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,920
we do a good job of this process

385
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,600
so after doing a threat model critique

386
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,040
what you might have missed

387
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,200
what can you add for next time i would

388
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
say that threat modeling processes are

389
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,040
are evolving for whatever your your

390
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
company or or

391
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,399
your workplace is it's like you're going

392
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,399
to have threat modeling

393
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,320
processes that bring everybody in the

394
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,160
room and hash it all out

395
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,200
or you might have threat modeling

396
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,360
processes that are more asynchronous

397
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,959
especially in the time of uh

398
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,560
everybody working from home is like you

399
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,079
have this document and you're like

400
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,480
hey developers can you can you fill out

401
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,600
these questions or

402
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,079
or meet with me one-on-one to talk about

403
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:36,720
it but

404
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,000
it's all about finding a process that

405
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,399
works for you i think that any

406
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,160
um any system can can benefit from a

407
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,959
threat modeling a process of any size

408
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,240
and you can get

409
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,920
really extensive like the people at

410
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,360
microsoft do

411
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,800
and they're building operating systems

412
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,639
so it makes sense for them but even for

413
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,399
the smallest web application that you

414
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,240
put out into the world a quick threat

415
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,440
model is going to help you catch things

416
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,240
that you

417
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,440
you might not catch otherwise

418
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
so when should you threat model like

419
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,240
when when should you bother doing this

420
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,440
process

421
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,560
so you want to do it when a system is

422
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
being built i would say right after you

423
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,079
get the tech spec

424
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,120
it's a really good time because you

425
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,480
don't want developers to be writing

426
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,600
things that you could have solved for

427
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,760
early in the process when you're making

428
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,440
changes to a system

429
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,120
when things are drastically changing

430
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,800
with that it's a good time to just

431
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,200
sit down and reassess okay are risks the

432
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,639
same are our mitigations

433
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,000
sufficient should we be changing

434
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,480
anything then after an incident

435
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,040
you know the after things go wrong is is

436
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,000
a really good time to

437
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,839
to re-examine what what you're what

438
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,360
you're working with is there something

439
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,199
that the threat model could have caught

440
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,720
did the incident um expose anything else

441
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,120
that that um that you might not have

442
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,639
looked at before

443
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,240
again it's a it's a living process so

444
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,600
finding out what works for you is is

445
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,760
really critical here

446
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,440
so here's some further resources for you

447
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,279
for diving a little deeper

448
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,440
uh threat modeling manifesto the the

449
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,560
creators of this have been doing a lot

450
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,320
of good talks around threat modeling

451
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,240
uh the past year i would check their

452
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,760
their site out

453
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,560
um adam chestax book threat modeling

454
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,240
designing for security is

455
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,040
the the expert text here there's another

456
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,920
new book uh

457
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,839
threat modeling and practice guide for

458
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,199
development

459
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,560
um that's pretty good and then the os

460
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,320
threat modeling guide if you can take

461
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,639
one link here and read through it after

462
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,199
today

463
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,120
i would suggest that one it talks about

464
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,320
what i talked about in

465
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,279
in much more detail

466
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,560
sorry about that it talks about what i

467
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,760
talked about in much more detail

468
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,519
so yeah so as i mentioned before i'm

469
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,399
from slack

470
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,320
uh we are hiring for security people if

471
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,920
you're interested uh check out our

472
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,800
careers page

473
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,199
and then you can email me about any um

474
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,720
any uh careers you see there that you

475
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,839
might be interested in

476
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,199
we do threat modeling if you're

477
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,880
interested in threat modeling we

478
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,680
um nice to have you so yeah

479
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,800
next up something completely different

480
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
how to listen to the international space

481
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,839
station with a 30

482
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,560
radio this is also by me greg horton my

483
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,199
call sign is k6xss

484
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,279
for cross-site scripting it's very hard

485
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,880
to say and

486
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
i may have chosen a different call sign

487
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,920
if i knew how hard it was

488
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
for people to say but it is fun to to

489
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,279
reference uh security stuff

490
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,560
so quick primer ham radio

491
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,639
uh this refers to amateur radio

492
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,720
operators licensed by the fcc

493
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,920
so you do have to have a license to um

494
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,240
to do ham radio and to transmit on these

495
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,920
frequencies

496
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,440
and there's certain frequencies that are

497
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,720
allocated for amateurs to use

498
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,880
so what frequencies are we talking about

499
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,079
so we have uhf

500
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,639
which is ultra high frequency which is

501
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,279
covers

502
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,480
420 to 450 megahertz and we call that

503
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,600
70 centimeters this refers to the length

504
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,240
of the

505
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,560
um the wavelength of radio that you're

506
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,759
working with

507
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,959
we have vhf which is 144 megahertz to uh

508
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:05,839
148

509
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,399
very high frequency 2 meter so that's a

510
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,240
2 meter

511
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,440
a length of frequency and then high

512
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,040
frequency which covers 10 meters through

513
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,240
160 meters

514
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,839
which allows you to talk to people in

515
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,360
different countries

516
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,440
when the conditions are right i can hear

517
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,600
people i'm in california and i can hear

518
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,639
people in japan

519
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,240
and i can talk to people in russia which

520
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,639
is pretty cool

521
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,160
this is here's a big old chart of all

522
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,320
the frequencies that amateurs get

523
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,959
when they are when they are licensed by

524
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:35,680
the sec

525
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,600
so as you can see you can see the 160

526
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,880
meters 80 meters

527
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,320
15 meters two meters um there's also

528
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,880
some

529
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,120
microwave frequencies that you get so if

530
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,920
you're into

531
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,639
playing with um with microwave radios

532
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,240
you could do that too as an amateur

533
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,680
so radios uh i've been interested in

534
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,360
radio stuff for maybe a decade but i

535
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,959
didn't actually get my license until

536
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,000
last year

537
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,920
and one of the things that kept me away

538
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,680
is that radios are super expensive

539
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,000
like even a little handheld radio is

540
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,919
over a hundred dollars usually

541
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,079
um a few years ago chinese company

542
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,199
brought a cheaper

543
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,880
um version to market it's the baofeng

544
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,400
uv5r

545
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,679
i have it right here in bright red um

546
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,199
these are 30 to 50 bucks on amazon they

547
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,439
are four watts they can transmit and

548
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,359
receive on uhf and vhf

549
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,160
frequencies there's no limits on them so

550
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,039
they're pretty open

551
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,400
so be careful with them uh i can pick up

552
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,600
a um police scanner on this

553
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,520
if i were to hit the ptt button i might

554
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,120
be able to transmit on it that would be

555
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,960
bad that would break the rules

556
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,840
um some people hate these radios because

557
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,360
they're build quality they are very

558
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,000
cheap they

559
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
can have issues they can they can be a

560
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,200
little weird but

561
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,160
at 30 to 50 bucks you're not you're not

562
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,880
gonna

563
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,440
lose lose out on much it it's even worth

564
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,559
something to get

565
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,600
you know and throw it into a go bag or

566
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
um or just like have around for an

567
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,760
emergency so

568
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,360
they're pretty uh they're pretty use

569
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,080
useful little radios

570
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,559
okay so talked about radios what's a

571
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,600
repeater

572
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,720
that's that's what we're going to talk

573
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,880
about right now

574
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,160
so a repeater is takes this little radio

575
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,200
and makes your signal go that much

576
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,919
further

577
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,000
uh i'm part of a radio club here in my

578
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,200
local town

579
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,960
and we have our main thing is that we

580
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,799
have a repeater that we all talk on

581
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,600
and then if i just use that radio i can

582
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,320
hit

583
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,880
people in my neighborhood but hitting

584
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,559
the repeater on the same frequency

585
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,840
it takes my my signal and amplifies it

586
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,559
and sends it

587
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,160
to other people so i can actually talk

588
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,679
to people all over the city through the

589
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,679
repeater that's pretty cool

590
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,720
um repeaters exist all over the place

591
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,160
you can look them up online

592
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
you may be surprised that you're you

593
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,760
have a few dozen repeaters that people

594
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,000
are

595
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,280
constantly on um around you and there's

596
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,360
all kinds of different um

597
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,440
types of people who get into ham radio

598
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,120
there's people who just like to

599
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
talk about whatever usually about

600
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,320
antennas

601
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,480
um and then there's people who like to

602
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,880
use it for uh disaster preparedness

603
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,760
um and these are both the same kind of

604
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,760
people sometimes

605
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,160
so now you know and a repeater takes

606
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,760
your signal and bounces it

607
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,080
so it can it can go further and you

608
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,120
should know that they're not

609
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,960
there is a repeater on the international

610
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,240
space station

611
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,200
which means that we can throw our signal

612
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,400
that much further

613
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,840
as you can see here's a little diagram

614
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,039
of the international space station

615
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,799
there's two ham radios actually

616
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,160
on the space station there's one on the

617
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,520
european side and one on the russian

618
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,559
side

619
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,919
um and

620
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,640
with this repeater we can listen to the

621
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,320
iss and we can listen to

622
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,160
um other people who are hitting that

623
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
repeater so

624
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
the repeater downlink which is would be

625
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,840
our listening frequency

626
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,880
is 43.80 and then your uplink which

627
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,400
would be the transmit frequency

628
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,559
is 45.99 with a pl which is uh

629
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,840
of hertz which stands for that's the

630
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,159
frequency that turns the repeater on

631
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,080
so if you send that frequency it'll go

632
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,600
okay i'm listening

633
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,679
um and then there's also a voice in sstv

634
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,520
sstv the voice link here is how you

635
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,200
would actually hear

636
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,679
astronauts if they got on sometimes they

637
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,760
do it's very rare to hear them

638
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,600
most of the people most times when

639
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,799
you're trying to hit the iss you're

640
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,559
trying to hit that repeater

641
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,200
because in california in the bay area i

642
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,039
can hear people all the way in arizona

643
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,280
because the iss is so high up into the

644
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,559
um sky

645
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,760
um so it gives me a lot of range

646
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,720
and another tip here is turn off the

647
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,520
squelch

648
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,039
the squelch is what keeps it from

649
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,760
constantly static at you and if you turn

650
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,200
that off entirely you can kind of pick

651
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,400
up really weak signals

652
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,080
you'll want to do that as it's passing

653
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,480
over you

654
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,240
so sstv i mentioned that real quick and

655
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,880
i'll and

656
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,200
i'll talk about it um so this stands for

657
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,799
slow scan television

658
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,960
and this is a way that you can transmit

659
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,360
images through radio which is very very

660
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,000
neat

661
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,720
this image is for from the recent event

662
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,200
that the

663
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,080
international space station did um to

664
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,000
commemorate um

665
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,559
the anniversary of of um putting the um

666
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,880
the ham radio actually on the iss

667
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,919
and um they were they were sending

668
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:30,880
images down

669
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,760
uh through the the signal and you could

670
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,480
use a

671
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,159
um an app on your phone to record the

672
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:38,799
audio

673
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,120
and then an image would just pop up um

674
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,520
and so you can transmit sstv images as

675
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,159
well

676
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,280
you can use again another um a phone

677
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,320
application you can

678
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
send the image into it and it'll create

679
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,360
some

680
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,360
a data stream that will have a

681
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,720
particular sound and then you transmit

682
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,760
it through your radio and somebody can

683
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,480
pick it up

684
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,280
so you can put memes through the air now

685
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,320
you don't even need the internet

686
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,480
so you can track the international space

687
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,320
station so you know when to actually

688
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,799
go outside and wave your radio around

689
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,720
the best way that i found is to use an

690
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,600
uh a phone app i use the iss detector

691
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,799
app for android

692
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,559
and i set it up to give me alerts 30

693
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,480
minutes before a pass is about to happen

694
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,520
so if i'm

695
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,000
in the mood i have 30 minutes to get my

696
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,760
gear together put it together my antenna

697
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
and run outside and try to catch it

698
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,200
there's also a website heavens above

699
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,600
that will give you um tracking data but

700
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,360
i really think that the the phone app is

701
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,640
the best bet here because

702
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,960
um you also get a compass of where it's

703
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,720
coming from so you can point your body

704
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,840
in that direction

705
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,360
and then you can kind of be like okay

706
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,960
it's passing over me now

707
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,760
you can see the iss during night time

708
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,799
but during the day it's

709
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,280
it's impossible to see um it'll be a

710
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,200
move a fast-moving blinking light if

711
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,159
you're um

712
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,240
if you're looking for it and yeah if you

713
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,159
just want to be able to see the iss like

714
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:54,559
this

715
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,720
this app is is awesome and then you you

716
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
know show your kids show your show your

717
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,080
grandparents be like look there's space

718
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,480
there's

719
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,000
astronauts they don't have to deal with

720
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,159
our problems

721
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,480
so how to listen so you can use your

722
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,240
handheld radio

723
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,799
um you can tune into frequency and you

724
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,480
can hold it like this

725
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,120
this is less efficient than this it's

726
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,960
just how the science works

727
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,360
uh or you can get a directional antenna

728
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,919
as you can see here i have a little uh

729
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,360
antenna that i'm using and i'm pointing

730
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,120
it at the sky trying to get it and

731
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,039
phone in one hand tracking it radio in

732
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,200
the other um

733
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,799
and yeah you just point point it to the

734
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,760
sky and you can follow it on the um

735
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,320
on the um on the app and you basically

736
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,039
point it

737
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,880
in the sky about where it is and you'll

738
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,400
you'll have to move around and you'll be

739
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,760
dancing around your yard and then you'll

740
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,200
hear it and you'll be like oh

741
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
i hear that i hear people and then

742
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
you'll try to get your signal out

743
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,360
um there's going to be people with more

744
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,559
power than you so

745
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,120
um you'll be competing a little bit but

746
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,799
you can make it with a handheld radio

747
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,400
i have done it and this isn't just the

748
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,760
international space station actually

749
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,880
this is um

750
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,960
amateur radio operators throw their own

751
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,159
satellites in the

752
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,000
into space and you can catch those as

753
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,919
well and that's pretty

754
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,919
pretty cool so some things to add

755
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,840
um i didn't cover doppler shift or um

756
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,520
or pass angles so a pass angle is

757
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,120
essentially like

758
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,360
um how what angle it is in the sky

759
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,320
and the closer it is to 90 degrees aka

760
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,360
right above you

761
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,120
uh the better pass you're gonna get if

762
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,400
it's closer to the horizon

763
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,559
and their sills or whatever you're going

764
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,080
to get a less less of a good

765
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,360
pass to um to get it so the

766
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,840
closer it is to 90 degrees you're good

767
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,919
uh doppler shift refers to the fact that

768
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:44,799
um

769
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,720
like ambulances when they pass you and

770
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,000
they make that sound where it gets

771
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,520
higher pitched and lower pitched as it

772
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,320
goes away

773
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,120
well that happens as well with radio

774
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,480
frequencies and so you

775
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,279
if you really want to get a good um a

776
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:57,760
good

777
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,520
signal on the iss you'll actually be

778
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,200
changing your frequency as it comes

779
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,000
towards you

780
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,720
and then reducing it as it comes comes

781
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,360
back so

782
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,480
depending on how it's coming through the

783
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,960
sky and you can if this is interesting

784
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,919
to you you can look all those

785
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,360
frequencies up i'm not going to go into

786
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,840
them all today

787
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,960
uh big disclaimer though i talked a lot

788
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,200
a lot about the iss repeater got you

789
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,480
really excited about it

790
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,279
it's down uh they decided to change some

791
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,039
cables a few months ago and they haven't

792
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,080
been able to fix it yet

793
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,320
because the ham radios i think is

794
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,279
probably low on their

795
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,720
their uh their priority list um but you

796
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,679
can still

797
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,919
um tune in to some frequencies when

798
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,240
they're trying to contact schools

799
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,799
um and you can look at the uh ar iss

800
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,520
website for

801
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
when those are happening but it's down

802
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,360
for now it should be fixed soon

803
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,840
um they have been working on and fixing

804
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,799
some of the parts of it

805
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,840
um so we'll see

806
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,960
do you want more um if this is

807
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,159
interesting to you if you're interested

808
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,279
in radio at all

809
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,919
get licensed most most licensing isn't

810
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,360
happening online now so it's super

811
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,240
simple

812
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
um again it took me a decade to actually

813
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,279
feel

814
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,279
like i could could take the test and the

815
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,559
test to you know

816
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,600
i'll say it now it's not that hard but i

817
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,360
was intimidated by it for a long time

818
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,640
you don't need to know morse code

819
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,400
anymore uh you do

820
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
and it's if you're good with with a

821
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,080
little bit of math and uh

822
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,440
interested you'll do fine um

823
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,120
if you want to email me you can email me

824
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,720
at k6xss

825
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,320
arrl.org and i'll get that email

826
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,159
and i have a website that i threw one

827
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,240
blog up on i want to do more

828
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,080
ham radio blogging but i don't have the

829
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,679
time but yeah

830
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,720
um that's how you can contact me uh

831
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,840
here's some references

832
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,320
uh there's a old make scene article from

833
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,360
2009 about

834
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,799
listening to satellites on ham radio the

835
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,919
and then the ar iss is the org that

836
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,919
sets up the amateur radio on the

837
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,200
international space station

838
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,799
and they have some guides about or they

839
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,559
have a guide about contacting the

840
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,600
the space station and then amsat.org

841
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,840
is a tracker of all the amateur

842
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,799
satellites

843
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,600
plus the iss repeater and that status

844
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,279
website will tell you

845
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,679
if anybody has heard the the space

846
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:14,799
station in a while

847
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,880
and you can go to that website and say

848
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,320
oh has anybody heard it lately and

849
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,679
that's how you can check if it's fixed

850
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:22,480
or not

851
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,279
spoiler alert nobody has so i'll be

852
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,399
checking it later today though and

853
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,520
seeing

854
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,640
anyway that's all from me

855
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,720
thank you so much

856
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,880
excellent greg that was an amazing talk

857
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,240
we do have a few

858
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,440
questions um first one being

859
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,760
uh well back to the threat modeling of

860
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,640
course which was first

861
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,080
the first question we got was how do you

862
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,399
determine probability for adverse events

863
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,760
determine probability for adverse events

864
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,080
i think you just have to you have to

865
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,480
know about your system and um

866
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,840
i would say that i would try to use

867
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,520
something um

868
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,880
like a cvss score might help but yeah

869
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,919
um it's really takes the practice

870
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,960
of of um of determining the severity and

871
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
the likelihood

872
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,080
yeah okay great and then uh

873
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,159
in your experience what elements of

874
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,679
threat modeling have you found to be

875
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,520
more challenging for non-security

876
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,960
experts and how to address them

877
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,840
um i actually think that threat modeling

878
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,200
is a really good way to get into

879
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,880
security because it doesn't necessarily

880
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,799
require a lot of technical knowledge

881
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,039
but i would say the the mitigation

882
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,720
pathways i think are the

883
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,399
most difficult and i would say not

884
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,240
necessarily non-technical but for the

885
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,600
people who aren't familiar with the

886
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,559
system

887
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,399
for example being in security i think

888
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,480
that like a lot of us

889
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,039
we didn't build it necessarily so we

890
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,880
don't uh we don't know

891
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,640
um all the different elements and i

892
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,320
think that that means that

893
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,679
it's really important to bring in the

894
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,120
stakeholders and the people who built

895
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,039
the system to do the threat model

896
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,600
um so you know that those mitigations

897
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,720
are like

898
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,039
safe and sound and make sense for

899
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,720
whatever system you're dealing with so

900
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,320
yeah but i think like thinking like a

901
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,760
bad person

902
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,840
that's easy you know we that's what we

903
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,120
do so

904
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,399
right okay great and then um how

905
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,080
how deep do you go into your threat

906
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,720
modeling and they gave a great example

907
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,440
of for example say you look at threat

908
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,279
models for ub keys

909
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,640
how do you account for things like your

910
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,880
user's dog swallows the key so they lose

911
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,360
access

912
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,039
is that too deep um

913
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,760
i i would consider that out of scope for

914
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,320
me

915
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,159
um i mean yeah like

916
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,600
if you have a dog that likes to eat

917
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,520
things i guess then in your throat model

918
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,399
that is

919
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,440
high likelihood and uh in the

920
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
in the world of like distributed work

921
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,799
that would be kind of critical because

922
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,240
you wouldn't be able to access things

923
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,679
for like a week

924
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,039
because you have to be mailed a new one

925
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,960
um but yeah i

926
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,120
i would say that once things start

927
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,799
getting

928
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,760
fun and silly you probably need to real

929
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,200
reel it back but like there

930
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,120
there's an element to like having fun

931
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,480
during a threat modeling session

932
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,080
we usually limit ours to um 90 minutes

933
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,480
where we um i didn't talk about a lot

934
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,080
about our processes but we bring in

935
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,200
developers

936
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,520
uh to talk with us about their their

937
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,640
system and we

938
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,000
just go through everything that can go

939
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,760
wrong and we can go through

940
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,559
how to fix it um and so in that timeline

941
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,200
like

942
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,480
trying to keep that tight i think is

943
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,480
like um

944
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,720
how not to go too far into the weeds of

945
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,760
like what what's

946
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
likely for what you're doing you know

947
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,360
right right

948
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,120
okay and then is there a suggested

949
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,960
pathway to get some experience before

950
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,200
applying for threat modeling roles or

951
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,480
even other skills that would be helpful

952
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,559
to get started

953
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,760
um i would say do it like and

954
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,559
and if you're already working in in a

955
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,360
tech role

956
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,039
encourage your like if you're a

957
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,600
developer i come from web development so

958
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,120
this is how i'm thinking it's like

959
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,480
uh when you're working on a a tech spec

960
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,320
and you're a developer just throw in a

961
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,159
security section throw in a mini threat

962
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:10,720
model

963
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,080
you know do do like do like a 20-minute

964
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,760
threat model with yourself and think of

965
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,039
like okay what can go wrong with this

966
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:17,760
system

967
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320
and write that out um the books that i

968
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,039
mentioned though

969
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,640
are um are essential to

970
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,399
i think the threat modeling ecosystem

971
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,080
and like if you read through those

972
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,279
you'll have a really good idea of what

973
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:29,919
to do

974
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,919
but i think it also comes out of doing

975
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,519
it and figuring out what works for

976
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,519
your your company or your organization

977
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,399
okay and then do you recommend a site

978
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,320
like radio reference for finding

979
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,760
frequencies

980
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,240
yeah radio reference is great um i think

981
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,120
i have

982
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,720
one of the apps on my phone but yeah i

983
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,559
use that to find

984
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,200
different repeaters around me and you

985
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,840
can also um

986
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,440
i'm forgetting the site but there's like

987
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,960
any of the sites that have like

988
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,200
place scanner frequencies that are live

989
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,799
you can actually just listen to the

990
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,919
repeaters there

991
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,480
and um that if you don't have a radio

992
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,000
yet that might be a good idea

993
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,039
there's also something called utah scr

994
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,760
which stands for software to find radio

995
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,960
and you can google that

996
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,320
and that gives you a an online radio

997
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,360
where you can

998
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,159
explore any of the high frequency bands

999
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,760
and so if you want to listen to

1000
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,279
things on there you can do that without

1001
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,320
a radio

1002
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,840
and then do you

1003
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,320
use a defense in-depth checklist when

1004
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,080
having threat modeling reviews with

1005
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,080
developers uh we have checklists that we

1006
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,000
use for our

1007
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,399
secure development life cycle that that

1008
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,840
cover like

1009
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,720
common um pitfalls and how to mitigate

1010
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,679
against them

1011
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,200
but for threat modeling we

1012
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,640
yeah that's kind of a different part at

1013
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,559
slack of like we have our checklist that

1014
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:56,799
we

1015
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,960
produce for every um for every project

1016
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,320
that developers are expected to go

1017
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,440
through and then

1018
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,399
they um and then they come to us with

1019
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,279
any questions

1020
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,279
but yeah we i don't we don't use that

1021
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,559
for our threat modeling yet

1022
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,120
but i'd like to um if you can ping me in

1023
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,000
the chat i'd

1024
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,279
like to know exactly what you what

1025
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,760
you're thinking there

1026
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,960
okay and then if you had only a 100

1027
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,640
for starter gear what would you invest

1028
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,159
in

1029
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,000
um a balfing radio a long antenna for it

1030
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,360
because it comes with a little short

1031
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,039
little rubber ducky

1032
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,600
and um i don't know that would get you

1033
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,559
about 60

1034
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,919
and you'd be okay um

1035
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,200
yeah trying to think of what else i

1036
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,600
would have i mean the prices go up so

1037
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,200
quick you can like you can

1038
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,720
you can blink and spend like two

1039
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,399
thousand dollars on a shack

1040
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,200
um but yeah like a good uh a little

1041
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,960
balfang and a good antenna

1042
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,519
and then looking at upgrading your radio

1043
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,000
from there

1044
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,679
is getting like a one that can do

1045
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,519
digital modes um

1046
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,200
because that's kind of opens you up to

1047
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
being able to connect to um

1048
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,640
all kinds of different things and like

1049
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,919
getting on the internet with your little

1050
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:02,640
hd

1051
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,000
yeah and and just just

1052
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,560
to be clear with the baofeng radio you

1053
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,199
can

1054
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,520
use it before you get licensed correct

1055
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,760
like you can listen on frequencies

1056
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,359
you just can't transmit anything is that

1057
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,359
right yes legally

1058
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,320
like yeah but like i mean you can push

1059
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,599
the button and you'll

1060
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,119
it'll do whatever it doesn't prevent you

1061
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,199
from anything but yeah um

1062
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,960
yeah you can listen all all day long i

1063
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,119
had my baofeng for a year before i got

1064
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:29,679
licensed

1065
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,520
because you know i heard about a cool

1066
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,679
little radio and of course i bought it

1067
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,800
um

1068
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,719
yeah but yeah yeah you can you can buy

1069
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,560
it today and and use it but yeah

1070
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,800
then were there any um study guides you

1071
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,280
would suggest for the radio exam

1072
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,480
yeah sorry i didn't cover that um

1073
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,719
hamstudy.org

1074
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,760
is amazing they make a phone app it's

1075
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,520
not free but it's worth the

1076
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,879
few bucks and um it'll grind you through

1077
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,599
the questions

1078
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,240
so the thing about ham radio licensing

1079
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,079
is that it's a pool of questions

1080
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,560
so it's not like they don't like you

1081
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,599
don't have to do like an essay or

1082
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,040
anything to get licensed

1083
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,880
so if you just grind on the questions

1084
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,640
and you remember memorize the answers

1085
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,280
you can pass the test um and i actually

1086
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,640
suggest that for people who are getting

1087
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,599
started because you're going to do all

1088
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,960
your learning

1089
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,240
when you have your radio when you're

1090
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,000
getting into it and

1091
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,160
once you uh once you learn the the

1092
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,839
questions to get the license

1093
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,960
then that opens the door it's not until

1094
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,240
you get into some of the more

1095
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,640
advanced licensing like the amateur

1096
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,079
extra which is the last one

1097
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,920
where you really actually do need to

1098
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,920
start to know the material

1099
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,400
to pass the test but yeah put that on

1100
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,119
your phone

1101
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,359
delete instagram delete twitter stop

1102
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,800
getting arguments on the internet for a

1103
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,520
few months

1104
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,240
and you'll be a license in no time at

1105
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,920
all

1106
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,000
excellent uh okay and then what does

1107
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,920
programmable aspect mean what does the

1108
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,599
programmable aspect mean of a handheld

1109
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,440
radio

1110
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,280
uh the programmable aspect

1111
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,960
so for the bow things you can program

1112
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,359
them with a a program called chirp

1113
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,520
which that's just means putting in all

1114
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,839
the um the frequencies

1115
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,079
um if you're talking about digital modes

1116
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,200
that's just like

1117
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,400
digital versus analog audio um

1118
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,160
but yeah like you can program the radios

1119
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,480
to i have mine programmed with

1120
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,520
i uploaded all the all the repeaters

1121
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,560
around me within like

1122
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,200
a certain radius i think i did 50 miles

1123
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,640
and i just put them on my radio and then

1124
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,160
i'll scan through them to find things

1125
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,640
so yeah got it and for the

1126
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,599
uh for the antenna will the um will any

1127
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,960
antenna extender do

1128
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,400
or you have to look for something

1129
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,200
specific for the balfing

1130
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,400
um it should match the right um so i

1131
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,000
have the signal stick

1132
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,320
uh what it's called and this is um from

1133
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,599
the people who

1134
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,200
make hamstudy.org and um

1135
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,760
they that's one of the ways they make

1136
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,839
money because their website is free

1137
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:58,960
you want to make sure that it's the

1138
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,320
right adapter i don't know if you can

1139
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,920
see that on the camera but like

1140
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,560
that is a

1141
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,760
unfortunately named female adapter and

1142
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,560
this is a

1143
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,440
unfortunately named male adapter input

1144
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,119
output

1145
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,599
and that's what you would need sma is

1146
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,040
the type of adapter that you're working

1147
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,200
with

1148
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,720
excellent thanks um i know we have a

1149
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,160
couple more minutes but

1150
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,640
um okay here's another how does the

1151
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,480
balfan compare to something like the

1152
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,240
dvb-t or the dav

1153
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,279
rtl sdr

1154
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,880
well if you're talking about an sdr

1155
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,359
that's different and you're probably not

1156
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,560
going to be able to transmit on it

1157
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
unless it's a very expensive one

1158
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,920
i mean the baofeng is a analog transmit

1159
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,040
receive radio

1160
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,280
so that's the difference there um i will

1161
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,480
look at your question though i don't

1162
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,000
know exactly what you're talking about

1163
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,040
um i'm very new and also

1164
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,520
this ha if you are into a hobby where

1165
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,160
you

1166
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,440
can get lost in the weeds of

1167
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,960
like there is a million ways to go in

1168
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,880
ham radio like again i mentioned

1169
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,839
microwave there

1170
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,599
is people who set up uh emergency

1171
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,720
microwave internet um

1172
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,119
backbones which is really cool there's

1173
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,480
people who do high frequency stuff and

1174
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,119
try to talk

1175
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,359
across the world there's digital modes

1176
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,520
on high frequency where you just send

1177
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,920
little tiny packets and people send

1178
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,280
little tiny packets back to you it's

1179
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,920
like

1180
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,440
the sky's the limit once you open the

1181
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,680
door

1182
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,640
and then i think um do you ever get on

1183
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,280
the

1184
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,400
wins system i haven't yet

1185
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,160
um but yeah my uh

1186
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,480
yeah i i mostly have been doing my

1187
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,599
digital stuff is like

1188
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,240
ft8 which the person who and asked this

1189
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,680
question probably knows what that is

1190
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,200
um but no i haven't gotten on the win

1191
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,440
system yet um but yeah you can send

1192
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,280
email on damn radio now too so that's

1193
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,560
part of the win system

1194
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,839
pretty cool for new for noobs can you um

1195
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:00,880
tell us what the wins

1196
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,000
system is uh i

1197
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,240
think it's like internet-enabled ham

1198
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,440
radio again i haven't dived

1199
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,599
too much into it or but it's like

1200
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,280
internet over

1201
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,640
cam radio but somebody probably can

1202
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,720
answer it better than i can in chat yeah

1203
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,800
yeah ed please answer that in the chat

1204
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,320
thanks

1205
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,960
um i think i think another question that

1206
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,640
uh the audience wants answered is where

1207
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,960
did you get your shirt

1208
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,920
oh i would have to take it off and look

1209
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,599
at the and look at the tag and i'm not

1210
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,480
going to do that

1211
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,079
um i think i no this one was from target

1212
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,200
yeah definitely target for the win

1213
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,160
awesome um okay and then i know you did

1214
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,520
mention that the

1215
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,040
repeater is down so what's

1216
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,720
like what can somebody do now besides

1217
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,240
study for their test obviously

1218
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,079
um what can you do in the meantime until

1219
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,599
it comes back up

1220
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,520
um if you're interested in space

1221
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,119
listening uh again there's

1222
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,359
other amateur satellites that are around

1223
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,720
and you can catch those and those are

1224
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
also featured

1225
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,800
in the iss detector app um and you can

1226
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,920
try to catch some of those if you're

1227
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,760
interested in just space stuff

1228
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,640
um as for listening um if you buy this

1229
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,160
radio and you want to see what to listen

1230
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,880
to

1231
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,280
uh i would start hitting up the local

1232
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,319
repeaters around you

1233
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,040
and listening to those um also if you

1234
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,480
get really bored you can just listen to

1235
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:18,800
the

1236
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,359
um the weather reports the weather

1237
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,880
frequencies are always fun um yeah

1238
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,960
that's what i would suggest but yeah i

1239
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,079
mean if this is

1240
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,359
if this is something that's interesting

1241
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,280
to you at all though i really suggest

1242
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,720
getting a license it'll take you a month

1243
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,520
of studying

1244
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,359
probably less if you're if you know how

1245
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,000
to study yeah

1246
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,040
excellent perfect thank you so much greg

1247
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,640
