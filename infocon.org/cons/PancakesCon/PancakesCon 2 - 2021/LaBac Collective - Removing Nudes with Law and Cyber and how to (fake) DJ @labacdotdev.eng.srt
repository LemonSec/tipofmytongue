collective

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,560
um we are going to give this

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,439
presentation

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,479
um about removing nudes with law and

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,120
cyber

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,320
and then we will talk about uh

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,879
dj psyops and perception management

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,160
in the club scene um

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,399
before we get started um we want to

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,920
provide a content warning

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,160
we are talking about uh what's

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,360
collectively known as

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,280
revenge porn we also deal a lot with

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,680
cyber sexual abuse and harassment in

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,039
this space

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,520
um we are not going to be offended if

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,760
you need to

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,360
take a step away some of these topics

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,320
are very hard

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,520
but we take it upon ourselves to to talk

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,080
about it uh when we can't but

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,240
we bear in mind that everyone needs a

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,759
content warning for this

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,439
um a little bit about us

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,600
so i am a computer engineer

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,360
and i also specialize in cyber security

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,560
policy

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,920
uh i'm i've also founded

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,960
a organization called decrypted so what

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,520
we do

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,000
is provide accessible educational

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,200
resources

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,880
with regard to cyber security

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,320
and i'm erin pronounced them i

43
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,399
enjoy working as a security researcher

44
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,240
trusted safety researcher um i started

45
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,600
le bach with a cohort of mine a couple

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,399
years ago

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,360
and ever since then we've added more to

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,079
it so

49
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,200
uh what is labok um fun fact

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,598
it's cabal backwards we've never

51
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,000
actually publicly acknowledged that

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,640
um but it's uh mostly a hacker

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,440
collective

54
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
with a bunch of people from other groups

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
um what we wanted to do when we

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,720
initially started it was united

57
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,080
folks who were thinking about tech

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,400
criticism folks who were in the cyber

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,680
sexual abuse

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,879
space and just share resources

61
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,480
get people in the same like chats

62
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,720
so that we could talk about what we're

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,840
doing separately

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,160
and share resources that we may want to

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,440
deploy across

66
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,080
different segments so you may know some

67
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,800
of these groups like cyber decrypted

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,800
tech against fascism we are also members

69
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,720
of the new york cyber sexual abuse task

70
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,280
force

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,800
um hello to those watching um

72
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,720
that is a joint task force in new york

73
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,599
full of really awesome people uh who

74
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,080
work

75
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,959
in the cyber sexual abuse space um

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,120
fighting for survivors

77
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,040
uh we also are the curators of the

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,519
museum of modern malware at defcon

79
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,920
um i know it's been a while since the

80
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,000
last irl defcon but

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,159
it was cool and it was fun and i'm

82
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,640
excited to do it one day again

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,440
uh and um you can contact us at

84
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,840
labok.dev

85
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,400
at labok.dev on twitter you know we we

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,640
look forward to every message that we

87
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,958
get there

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,280
all right so i'm gonna tell you a little

89
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
bit about decrypted which is a new

90
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,560
organization

91
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,760
um so we provide accessible educational

92
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,280
security resources

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,400
completely free of charge um so this

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,959
is really targeted toward people who

95
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,000
don't feel

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,920
like they're included in conversations

97
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
regarding cyber security

98
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,280
um so in 2021

99
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,319
cyber security is really a basic

100
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,599
life skill at this point um it is

101
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,439
a key part of cyber self-defense

102
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,560
and there are a few just

103
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,600
hacks that everybody could use uh we're

104
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,079
also

105
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,358
a member organization of the bach and

106
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,360
with that we're also members of the new

107
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,639
york cyber sexual

108
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,759
abuse task force so our largest platform

109
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,560
at the moment

110
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,759
is instagram just to reach everybody so

111
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,240
if you are interested in what we do you

112
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,080
can reach us at decrypted.tech

113
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,758
or on instagram we're also

114
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
decrypted.tech

115
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,280
all right so now we're going to get into

116
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,479
something that is very uh

117
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,520
important but not always practice so

118
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,840
we're going to talk about sending needs

119
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
safely

120
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,320
so one of the basic things when you're

121
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,120
sending some

122
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,000
anything safely is to use an encrypted

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,960
channel

124
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,880
rather than uh just one side encryption

125
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,000
which is called encryption

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,800
and transit which is when you have your

127
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,759
message

128
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,199
from the sender going to the server

129
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,000
that processes something and at that

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,720
time it's jumbled up and encrypted

131
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,759
at the server level it's then decrypted

132
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,960
with a key

133
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,000
and then they are able to read it

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,400
and then it goes to the final recipient

135
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,280
so

136
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,520
what needs to happen when you're sending

137
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,639
sensitive information

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,840
is using end-to-end decryption so one

139
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,120
of the software's that we recommend

140
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,160
is protonmail and also

141
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,680
another one that we're going to get into

142
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,320
is signal you always want to use

143
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,720
open source software if you can that way

144
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,160
you know that the claims that are being

145
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,120
made are true

146
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,319
all right so signal this is a

147
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,240
great app that gained a lot of

148
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,400
popularity in 2020

149
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,280
um one of the huge benefits is the

150
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,080
default

151
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,560
end-to-end encryption so this is not

152
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,160
something that you see in a lot of apps

153
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,039
for example

154
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,680
telegram you need to take the steps to

155
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,000
make it end to end encrypted

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,840
also encryption is not available

157
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,039
for group chats whereas for signal it is

158
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,639
also with phone calls and

159
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,240
video chats so this also

160
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,319
minimizes the information associated

161
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,759
with your identity

162
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,759
the only thing that you need to sign up

163
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,840
for signal is a phone number

164
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,479
um you can use your own phone number or

165
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,240
you can mask it by using something like

166
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,479
google voice uh

167
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,039
as you can see in the little diagram we

168
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,319
have below

169
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,319
there's minimal information attached to

170
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,120
you with signal

171
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,360
and then with whatsapp you start getting

172
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,280
some more data that's linked to you

173
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,400
so location contacts

174
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,720
then you get into facebook facebook owns

175
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,000
everything

176
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,039
so that's where they get into your

177
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,000
biometric data health and fitness data

178
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,199
um

179
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
and then we have some other parts that

180
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,160
just make it easy to use like a built-in

181
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,599
blur tool

182
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,160
really what we're hammering in here is

183
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
if something's easy to use

184
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,560
people will use it um and you don't need

185
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,759
to have

186
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,520
a very complicated way

187
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,960
of sending something securely

188
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,240
all right so now another thing to keep

189
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,360
yourself safe is

190
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,879
some photo manipulation this can be

191
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,360
for anonymity or it can be for later

192
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,479
identification

193
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,720
so this is something that comes into

194
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,400
play when we're talking about sensitive

195
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,919
topics like revenge porn

196
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,039
so one of the first things that

197
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,879
unfortunately not a ton of people know

198
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,280
about

199
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,919
is eggs of data so when you take an

200
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,479
image

201
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,120
it's not just what meets the eye there

202
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,960
is an associated file

203
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,319
with over 50 tags on it

204
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,720
some of the things that are there are

205
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,120
extremely sensitive identifiers

206
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,160
so if you're able to open the exit data

207
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,280
you are often going to see a location if

208
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,840
the

209
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,599
if the photo was taken with a smartphone

210
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,479
so it gives exact coordinates along with

211
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,000
the date and time that

212
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,039
it was taken and then other things like

213
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,159
the camera information it also

214
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,240
allows the user to edit the copyright

215
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,440
information

216
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,200
um later we're gonna be talking about

217
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,480
dmca

218
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,480
and where copyright comes into play

219
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,000
so uh this is gonna sound really simple

220
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,760
because i know this is like a major part

221
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,040
of a lot of apps but

222
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,360
um a lot of people just don't turn

223
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,720
disappearing messages

224
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,760
on uh even though we all go to these

225
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,600
apps that have it as like a somewhat

226
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,279
standard feature

227
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,800
um so just your general reminder i don't

228
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,160
know who needs to hear it

229
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,800
but this is a feature that you need to

230
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,320
turn on yourself

231
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,560
um it doesn't need to be for 30 minutes

232
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,760
it could be for a week

233
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,959
um actually most of mine are for a week

234
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,640
because we are

235
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,839
talking about memes um but

236
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,800
you know there's there's actually a lot

237
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,240
of people i know who

238
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,320
who don't actually turn on the

239
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,000
disappearing messages in signal

240
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,279
um basically every app messenger has it

241
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,760
now

242
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,320
um and a lot of them even have

243
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,040
anti-screenshot protection as well

244
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
so these are all settings that

245
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,080
unfortunately not

246
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,800
on by default but they are there go and

247
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,080
find them they're very useful

248
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,320
um a little bit about water marking so

249
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,480
remember we aren't just scrubbing

250
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,760
exif data so that we could care about

251
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,480
privacy but

252
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,200
sometimes we actually want to add things

253
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,120
and that's for later identification a

254
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,640
big one is watermarking

255
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,760
uh watermarking your nudes great idea

256
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,959
um it helps us prove later that those

257
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,360
nudes are in fact yours

258
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
why would we want to do that well in a

259
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,640
copyright

260
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,560
scenario a watermark will actually help

261
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,360
us prove that you are the copyright

262
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,240
owner for

263
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,519
that material what's great about a

264
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,959
platform like only fans

265
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,000
which we are a member of um

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
you can actually upload anything to only

267
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,000
fans and it will put the watermark right

268
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,800
in the corner

269
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,920
a very simple way to prove that

270
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,519
it originated from your account um

271
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,200
by the way quick shout out on our only

272
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,880
fans um

273
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,760
we find that it's a great and easy way

274
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,959
to

275
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,279
get us on your case so if you're an only

276
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,240
fan user

277
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,360
you can essentially message us say

278
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,000
i give you the legal right to you know

279
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,920
go find my nudes on the internet

280
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,399
and that will actually be permissible

281
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,120
from

282
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,079
a dmca standpoint which is awesome which

283
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,440
is why we're there which is why we're

284
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,360
helping people out there

285
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,079
it's very simple way about doing it um

286
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,360
uh we have a quick demo of how

287
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,640
some of this might work uh fair yes okay

288
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,120
so

289
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,240
um we're just gonna put together a

290
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,480
situation where this might need to come

291
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,920
into play

292
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,399
um so very

293
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,839
intimate situation where two might

294
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,839
two people might be talking one thing

295
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,760
that always needs to be there

296
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,360
is consent and boundaries um regardless

297
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,160
of the platform this needs to be spoken

298
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,880
about

299
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,680
it doesn't need to be a long thing um

300
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,839
but it is important

301
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,480
so we don't want to be using something

302
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,160
like imessage

303
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,279
um because this will attach a lot of

304
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,399
things

305
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,440
to your identity um so we want to move

306
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,079
this to

307
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,360
an encrypted channel like signal so

308
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,279
before moving to signal we're going to

309
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,040
use something called exif

310
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,000
metadata so this allows us to scrub the

311
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,200
metadata

312
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
as you can see one of the things is you

313
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,880
can see the location that the photo was

314
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,839
taken

315
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,040
and you can just remove all of that with

316
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,680
a

317
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,160
key click

318
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,560
and then we're going to move to signal

319
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,839
and

320
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,440
here we have the encrypted channel

321
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,880
and one thing that we're going to turn

322
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,120
on is disappearing messages

323
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,000
um so let's say you want to leave it for

324
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,639
30

325
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,760
30 minutes

326
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,200
so before sending the picture this is a

327
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,959
matter of personal taste

328
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,240
if you would like to remove or blur your

329
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,880
face

330
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,040
signal has that built in and then you're

331
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,800
able to send it

332
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,920
and again safety does not have to be

333
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,240
a long drawn out process you can see

334
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,440
that this took

335
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:21,839
about a minute to do

336
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,800
we are going to wrap up with a little

337
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,200
bit about taking down content

338
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,639
um this next part

339
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,639
real quick i'm just going to say the

340
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,560
thing we talk about a lot

341
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,000
is are we giving tools and techniques to

342
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,279
the enemy and um a big part about what

343
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:43,760
labor

344
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,160
does is we see ourselves as having all

345
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,079
this cyber security knowledge hacking

346
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,199
knowledge whatever

347
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,360
um and we want to diffuse that give that

348
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,480
to people who

349
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,320
could use those skills but don't have

350
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,839
them because they don't work in cyber

351
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,160
so that's people like survivors of abuse

352
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,360
sex workers

353
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,160
but we talk a lot about in the security

354
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
community and we talk a lot about in the

355
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
cyber sexual abuse space

356
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,440
uh about whether we are giving tools to

357
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,880
abusers um and

358
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,720
i'll just say right now if we ever catch

359
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,480
you doing that you know

360
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,120
you you'll make a lot of enemies uh but

361
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,920
i know that

362
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,880
is not going to stop everybody finding

363
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,000
this content

364
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
is very useful if you're looking for

365
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,199
your nudes

366
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,720
it's also very useful if you're trying

367
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,560
to find them and i'm

368
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,040
going to be patently aware of that by

369
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,079
not

370
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,040
talking in detail

371
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,680
one thing about only fans and why

372
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,639
we're often requested by onlyfans users

373
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:44,959
to

374
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,639
go find their misused content

375
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,480
is because there's a lot of people who

376
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,720
don't want to pay for that content

377
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,199
one of the first places they go to are

378
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:55,839
reddit

379
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,360
followed by discord telegram twitter

380
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,639
it's not impossible to find these

381
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,079
in fact most reddit uh most

382
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,720
reddit content misuse cases we see on

383
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,079
the only fan slide

384
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,240
they will typically put the only fan's

385
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,480
username as the subreddit

386
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,519
um one thing that we essentially do when

387
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,399
asked is

388
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,720
we'll go to reddit act on behalf of the

389
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,839
only fans user

390
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,320
and say this subreddit is full of

391
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,360
misused content

392
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,440
here's the originals here's the uh the

393
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,040
uh infringing work

394
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,880
um and reddit will take it down no

395
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,399
problem guess what

396
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,360
um another thing for the other platforms

397
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,680
is

398
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,320
just doing a google door um double

399
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,079
quotations around the username you'll

400
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,800
find it eventually

401
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,000
um further research um this is

402
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,759
there's an awesome awesome article i

403
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,519
suggest everyone to put in their browser

404
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,320
and google it

405
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,639
but we're not going to talk it too much

406
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,440
you could take

407
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,560
image fingerprint hashes and essentially

408
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,920
create a database

409
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,000
um of wherever things are being posted

410
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,920
one long-term project that we are

411
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,519
working on is

412
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,600
essentially using forum scrapers that

413
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,680
we've used for the dark net

414
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,600
but use it on forums where they post

415
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,040
you know voluntary sexual imagery

416
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,279
we end up with a database full of image

417
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,720
hashes

418
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,759
and that's something that we can

419
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,680
reference later when someone wants to

420
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,120
know if any of their content's been

421
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,560
leaked there

422
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,759
um really really brief thing on the dmca

423
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,959
um it's a law that

424
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,079
does a lot of things um but for the most

425
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,560
part we're gonna use it as a tool to

426
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
uh make sure that copyright isn't being

427
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,600
infringed

428
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,199
um some websites have a very easy form

429
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,000
to use this otherwise you have to

430
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,480
actually

431
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,160
send it in to whatever email address or

432
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,959
contact info

433
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,440
that site might have if they are

434
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,959
operating in the us

435
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,079
and they have user gender generated

436
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,160
content being uploaded

437
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,319
then they have to have participation in

438
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,640
this there will be some sort of contact

439
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,520
info

440
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,959
um if you want the full story um you can

441
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,880
go to our website labok.dev

442
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,919
content we have links to all the major

443
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,439
social media platforms

444
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,880
content takedown sites as well as

445
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,119
a dmc eddy template that you are free to

446
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,639
use that works in the past

447
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,400
very very quickly first you draft the

448
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,880
letter

449
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,280
in the exact format that is required by

450
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,480
law

451
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
you send this to the websites either via

452
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,679
that contact form

453
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,000
or the dedicated emails that they have

454
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,960
set up

455
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,240
and you await any follow-ups sometimes

456
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,600
they won't even notify you if the

457
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,440
content's been removed so just be sure

458
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
to keep on checking

459
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,080
um but this is this is like our

460
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,120
our bread and butter um this wasn't

461
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,440
like a very commonly used tactic maybe

462
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,240
even like

463
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,799
a couple of years ago i'm very happy

464
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,320
that more people are using this

465
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,080
they're watermarking their nudes they

466
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,400
are copyrighting them in some cases

467
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,000
and going after all the content misuse

468
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,559
that

469
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,000
they find themselves it's very um simple

470
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,600
to do as long as you follow

471
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,320
everything to a t um unfortunately

472
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,000
because of the

473
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,480
you know the the kind of obtuse like

474
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,840
legal understanding

475
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,240
that is required that might be a little

476
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,280
intimidating

477
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,160
just contact us ask for help if you ever

478
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,600
need it

479
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,240
or contact anybody else in this space

480
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,200
and

481
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,520
we'll make sure that we could do the

482
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,600
best that we can

483
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,280
um okay all right we're gonna pivot to

484
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,039
the second part of the presentation

485
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,200
um this is about

486
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,840
being a fake dj uh this is based on

487
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,720
experience

488
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,880
uh i i know it may not work for

489
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,799
everybody but

490
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,000
let me let me begin by talking

491
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,360
a little bit about what psyops are

492
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,440
if you work in the cyber security space

493
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,200
especially in a very particular part of

494
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,520
the cyber security space

495
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,160
you may have run into this um the

496
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,360
idea is that people have perceptions

497
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,679
that can be played with manipulated

498
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,360
um and you you hear a lot about this in

499
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,880
the social engineering

500
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,919
part of the hacking community um

501
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,840
psyops are typically uh

502
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,080
outside of the military context they're

503
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,240
they're they're broadened

504
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,080
social engineering campaigns across a

505
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,400
wide variety of people

506
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,440
um so

507
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,640
a little bit about djing well so there's

508
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,880
a classic look of what a dj looks like

509
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,480
a lot of times they have a turntables

510
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,799
with vinyl records

511
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,880
that's a little old school but the

512
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,960
concept is the same

513
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,080
you have two musical inputs two input

514
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,120
sources

515
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,439
and you are managing between the two

516
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,120
the concept is the same regardless if

517
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,360
you're using a cdj which is the most

518
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
popular digital one today

519
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,640
or you're djing with vinyl records um

520
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,080
you're you're gonna basically have the

521
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,480
same setup this is what that setup looks

522
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,640
like today with a digital

523
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,760
interface but since we're learning how

524
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,600
to fake dj

525
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,880
this is a little uh irrelevant

526
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,720
but you can see how on the left we have

527
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,159
an audio source on the right we have an

528
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,200
audio source

529
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,840
you're queuing up a playlist below and

530
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,039
you're managing

531
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,440
what the audience is hearing between the

532
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,559
two

533
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,000
um this is going to be important when

534
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,080
uh we are spinning up perception not

535
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,520
disks

536
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,240
here's the plan we're going to design an

537
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,159
aesthetic and brand for your dj alter

538
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,600
ego

539
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,919
we're going to come up with a playlist

540
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,720
it doesn't need to be that crazy

541
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,039
and uh we're gonna book a gig at a

542
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,320
non-suspecting bar

543
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,720
club or party um here's how you're gonna

544
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,799
do that you're either gonna call ahead

545
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,440
and say you're your manager booking for

546
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,960
the last leg of a tour

547
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,799
sounds they aren't gonna question it um

548
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,799
or you're just gonna walk in on a random

549
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,960
night and claim to be the dj for that

550
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,080
night now this

551
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,440
relies on a unsuspecting or

552
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,600
apathetic staff we'll get into that

553
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,480
later

554
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,320
um four you actually need to do the gig

555
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
and then five profit

556
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,760
a lot of these gigs typically pay in

557
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,480
cash or in drinks

558
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,240
um so here are some five tips

559
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,159
on how this works um most important one

560
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,400
confident body movement you got to be

561
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,240
bopping you got to be dancing

562
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,400
the occasional fist bumping if you have

563
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,360
your homies there

564
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,200
you're going to want to like have them

565
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,799
like whisper in your ear

566
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,840
you know you you kind of yeah yeah you

567
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,480
talk

568
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,320
but you got to be smiling you got to be

569
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,919
like looking like you're having a blast

570
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,880
you gotta know what you're doing when it

571
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,760
comes to the

572
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,640
hand movements um like i said we don't

573
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,400
need to know how to dj but you need to

574
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,120
at least

575
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,360
look like you're doing something it

576
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,480
could

577
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,679
i've actually coded and done work while

578
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,880
djing

579
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,960
and it gets the job done programming has

580
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,080
a lot of tip taps

581
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,600
it's fine um

582
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,280
the next one is astroturfing

583
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
this is important remember we've

584
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,600
established a brand an aesthetic

585
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,480
um hopefully you have a dj name pharah

586
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,840
what's your dj name

587
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,650
[Laughter]

588
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,799
[Laughter]

589
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,559
uh but hopefully hopefully you have your

590
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,919
instagram set up

591
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,400
that's important um instagram is

592
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,520
currency and

593
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,080
the number of followers that you have

594
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,039
will determine

595
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,679
the uh appreciation of that that

596
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,720
currency so

597
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,640
um you're just going to want to acquire

598
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,320
fake followers that's that's what you're

599
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,200
going to want to do

600
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,440
um you can get them for pretty cheap um

601
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,640
you can usually get

602
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,919
uh bulk packages of thousand five

603
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,360
thousand ten thousand

604
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,120
um another thing you need to think about

605
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,280
with this not like i'm some opsec

606
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,799
expert obviously but you are going to

607
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,640
want to buy likes as well

608
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,000
um the sus the suspecting

609
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,600
viewer of your instagram will be able to

610
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,280
see that you have a high follower

611
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,000
account

612
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,320
but not a high number of likes on your

613
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,360
posts

614
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,960
that's a red flag so you're going to

615
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,880
want to budget for

616
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,000
the number of likes and followers you're

617
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,720
going to need

618
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,039
you don't need a bunch i'd suggest 10

619
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,320
000 followers

620
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
and then you know a couple thousand

621
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,440
likes across

622
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,480
several posts um but remember everything

623
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,840
you post needs to be part of the

624
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,960
aesthetic

625
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,520
um another way you could hack that is if

626
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,039
you post stories you don't need to

627
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,080
necessarily buy likes on stories

628
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,840
um targeting all right very important

629
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,480
you're gonna want you're gonna want to

630
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,440
find a venue

631
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,799
with ideally these four things it's

632
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,840
known for djs or open mic sets um it's

633
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,159
in a low-key yet artsy area

634
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,520
um dj mail fraud's career was

635
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,279
all in bushwick brooklyn um

636
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,919
unassuming apathetic staff that's

637
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,360
they're your friends

638
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,440
um and they're the ones who are

639
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,039
essentially going to go along

640
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,720
with your grift and known for cheap

641
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,279
drinks

642
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,640
um booze is important um the more

643
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,960
alcohol is in circulation in the bar

644
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,120
the better you will sound and that is

645
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,640
not a you problem

646
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,080
that is a everybody else's problem

647
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,559
so yeah this is the venue

648
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,480
i'm not gonna state which one you could

649
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,679
see the defcon hat

650
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,720
that's how you know i was there um

651
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,720
aesthetic um so we talked a little bit

652
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,480
about this you need a dj name you need

653
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,200
an aesthetic

654
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,760
um you need a really cool poster you

655
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,080
need to dress cool

656
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,360
that's my attempt but you essentially

657
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
need to look cool

658
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,240
you need to look like what you think a

659
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,400
dj might look like and

660
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,440
that will go a long way no one's going

661
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,520
to question it when you're the coolest

662
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,559
person in the room

663
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,480
and you're carrying a computer and

664
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,159
saying you're the dj

665
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,080
um people will just go along with it

666
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,279
and lastly you're going to need a tiny

667
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,760
bit of musical know-how um

668
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,320
so i know that this is about being a

669
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,480
fake dj but you're gonna need

670
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,120
bare minimum these skills you're gonna

671
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,480
need to be able to put together a

672
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,279
playlist

673
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,279
i actually recommend putting together

674
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,960
like three playlists

675
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,400
um one sorted by ambient poppy hard

676
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,840
which will be anything from

677
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,480
like rock punk um to like hardcore

678
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,440
techno

679
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,760
and then uh latin i have an entire thing

680
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,640
of latin

681
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,840
um that's that's important

682
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,679
uh don't don't skip on the bad buddy um

683
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,400
you're also gonna want either cheap dj

684
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,720
software or literally just spotify um

685
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,000
spotify has a crossfade option

686
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,640
in the advanced settings you can go an

687
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,440
entire set

688
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,520
using that as long as you have the

689
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,840
playlist queued up exactly the order

690
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,440
that you want to

691
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,679
what they call in the industry selection

692
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,559
you can get pretty far with spotify's

693
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,799
automatic crossfade options so

694
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,640
so don't think that you need any sort of

695
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,960
like new software to do this you don't

696
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,640
you just need to be the selector and

697
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,679
to use the crossfade option um the most

698
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,240
important aspect for transitioning

699
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,200
between songs

700
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,039
whether you're doing it manually or

701
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,760
with relying on spotify's algorithm

702
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,200
you're going to want to

703
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,080
keep beat matching in mind even when

704
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,760
you're not doing this manually

705
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,240
so beat matching the concept is you want

706
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,559
to transition from song to song

707
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,600
where both songs have a similar tempo or

708
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,480
at least

709
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,320
they have a tempo close enough that when

710
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
you transition over

711
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
um whether it's sped up a little or sped

712
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,760
down a little um

713
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,840
it's gonna want to seem as seamless as

714
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,240
possible when it comes to the beat

715
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,559
you can't go from a slow song to a peppy

716
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,960
song without a little bit

717
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,919
of jarring from the audience perspective

718
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:38,480
um

719
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,240
so there are plenty of sites and

720
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,840
softwares that do this

721
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,880
um depending on the dj software again i

722
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,960
recommend dj pro it's free

723
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,720
right i think um they will actually do

724
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,240
it for you automatically

725
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,039
uh or you could go to a website like

726
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,600
songbp.com

727
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,480
just type in the song and it will give

728
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,120
you the key

729
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,840
it will give you the bpm and you can

730
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,440
start

731
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,399
planning your playlist accordingly based

732
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,120
off of

733
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,960
what the bpm is so again

734
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,440
a little bit of musical new how know-how

735
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,399
but you can

736
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,760
go a pretty long way faking it

737
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,840
uh and the outcomes are fun i mean you

738
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,679
get to be a dj

739
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,120
essentially um and you get to play a

740
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,279
a a gig which is hilarious

741
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,799
uh and really you get free drinks which

742
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:33,520
is

743
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,960
particularly half of why i did it

744
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,279
so yeah being a fake dj the secrets

745
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,720
of dj ing kind of spilled there

746
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,799
i mean uh they all look like they're

747
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,799
very busy they're not

748
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,919
they're they're not all right

749
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,200
well thank you um we'd be happy

750
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,399
to turn it over to our moderator i

751
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,480
actually don't know if we're going

752
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,360
are we doing a q a um yeah we've got

753

time for a q a if you guys want it

754
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,320
fantastic um how much how much time uh

755
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,440
we have

756
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,559
about 10. awesome cool um

757
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,600
well yeah let's do that um are

758
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,640
would we just take that from slack yeah

759
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,640
fantastic i don't see any questions in

760
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,279
there just yet but if anybody wants to

761
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,440
ask up then we can go from there we had

762
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,640
some minor

763
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,480
technical issues that we were working

764
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,000
through during your talk but everything

765
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,200
looks to be good now

766
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:40,960
so folks may be just catching up awesome

767
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,159
all right so our first question yeah

768
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,320
you can see that one uh what's up with

769
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,279
the gru flag

770
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,080
and where'd you get it oh what that

771
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,240
that's nothing um i got it from the

772
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,360
internet uh

773
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,000
where most people get loose things

774
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,080
nothing to see here

775
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
how do you find songs for your playlist

776
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,919
um well

777
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,679
i'm maybe i'm being a sumptuous but i

778
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,679
hope you have music taste um

779
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,919
and if you do have music taste then you

780
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:10,960
start thinking about

781
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,799
okay what are the songs i listen to when

782
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,240
i'm happy what are the songs i listen to

783
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,840
when it's sad

784
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,880
branch those out into different moods

785
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,600
vibes different playlists and you will

786
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,159
start

787
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,760
to uh you know get the ball rolling

788
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,360
thinking about other songs that you like

789
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,799
that are similar if you have something

790
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,080
like spotify again

791
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,679
the algorithm is everywhere they will

792
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,080
continue to recommend songs based off of

793
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,559
what you've added to a playlist

794
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,840
that's also good for selection um

795
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,640
but you know i get most of my music from

796
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,919
suggestions from friends

797
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,000
suggestions from algorithms like youtube

798
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and spotify

799
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,080
it's it's it's easy once you have a

800
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,159
couple to get the momentum

801
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,799
from all that recommendation and and get

802
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,799
some more on there

803
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,799
um how do you delete exif data through

804
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,720
your phones native at photo apps

805
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,480
or do you need a third party to do that

806
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,799
um yeah um fair maybe you could talk a

807
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,080
little about that i think that was

808
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,919
i don't know which app that was i forget

809
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,679
off the top of my head sure

810
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,880
um so you can't do it on any phone's

811
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,640
native app you can only view the access

812
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,919
data however if you're using apple you

813
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:18,559
can use

814
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,000
exif metadata or if you're using android

815
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,640
you can use

816
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,840
exif editor so these are free apps

817
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,799
really easy to use

818
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,519
is that for android and ios so

819
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,799
exif metadata for ios and then

820
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:47,840
exif editor for android

821
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,399
oh and there will be a recording awesome

822
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,399
can you touch more on how

823
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,240
anti-screenshot tech works

824
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,919
um so it's fairly new um

825
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,840
both ios and android have native sdks in

826
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,279
the operating system

827
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,480
for developers to use so

828
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,919
it's not something that you can

829
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,080
implement on your phone

830
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,159
so that it works on every single app it

831
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,080
will vary from application to

832
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,120
application

833
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,279
perfect example is most of the banking

834
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,480
apps have this now

835
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,320
you can't take a screenshot of your

836
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,799
account if you're in the jpmorgan chase

837
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,120
app

838
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,039
for instance and that works on android

839
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,480
and ios

840
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,519
um so it will depend

841
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,559
from app to app to app the way that you

842
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,880
turn it on in something like signal is

843
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,000
you have to go to the advanced

844
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,480
settings and it will

845
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,760
stop screenshots it supposed that but

846
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,080
again it relies on the developers of the

847
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,880
app to

848
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,480
implement it it's not something that you

849
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,799
could turn on across the entire

850
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,960
uh phone operating system um

851
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,679
oh there's more above thank you leslie

852
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:04,399
um

853
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,960
so do you have a recommendation on how

854
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,559
many transitions you need

855
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,320
to have a tempo versus more down tempo

856
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,480
in a given time if i have an hour long

857
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,600
set should i

858
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,080
peek once or twice an hour more or less

859
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,440
um

860
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,159
yeah i i think you mean like peak like

861
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,480
in terms of tempo

862
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,519
and yeah i i mean i don't necessarily

863
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,039
have a suggestion there i think

864
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,080
um one thing about being a fake dj is

865
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,799
you have

866
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,480
more uh more capacity to monitor the

867
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,200
crowd

868
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,919
and read the room and frankly that's

869
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,919
more important than any sort of musical

870
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,720
skill

871
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,039
um if people are feeling the music then

872
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,799
great you should just continue on

873
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,159
whatever you're doing

874
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,039
um don't try and force cocktail twins

875
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,080
when everyone's

876
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,600
like bopping to uh jlo so

877
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,399
um you know there's you gotta be

878
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,600
cognizant you know

879
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,399
again you're a social engineer you are a

880
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,720
psychological operator you want to

881
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,600
read people read the room get a sense of

882
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,639
what the vibe is

883
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,800
and exploit that you could have 10 peaks

884
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,679
for all i care if everybody's loving it

885
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,000
so

886
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,280
so no recommendation there other than

887
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,480
be cognizant of your environment um

888
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,359
let me look a little i i think leslie

889
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,879
said that there are some talks

890
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,800
or some questions let me just see if i

891
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,159
missed any i think we've caught up on

892
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,679
all of them we've got one last one about

893
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,440
x-fifth data and the parlor hack

894
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,719
and then we'll uh wrap up from there

895
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,599
okay um we don't have to answer that

896
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,130

00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:43,040
[Laughter]

898

peter peter peter is our paid stooge

899
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,960

900
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,320
um but i i hear exif data helped with

901
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,879
the

902
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,000
uh uh it helped with

903
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,040
people analyzing people

904
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,200
um who were involved in the interaction

905
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,920
uh i've heard about that

906
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,680
but you know who knows

907
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,359

908
