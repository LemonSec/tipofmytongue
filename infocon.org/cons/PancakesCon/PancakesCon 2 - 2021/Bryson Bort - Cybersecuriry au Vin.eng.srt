1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,960
and now we have cyber security of in

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,799
with bryson bort

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,919
welcome bryson hi

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,000
hi oh do i get to start five minutes

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,759
early yeah let's do it

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,360
oh all right so let's go out in five

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,520
more minutes let's let's do this hold on

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,880
let's wake up swing of courage

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,400
and let's get those slides up share

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,519
screen

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,840
feel free to take more sips if you need

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,240
time

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,399
and my slides are seen yep looks good

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,960
okay all right cyber security out

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,640
then because why shouldn't we drink

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
while we do cyber security

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,440
um all right who am i uh i founded a few

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,559
companies

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,559
um i founded grim a little bit more than

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,760
eight years ago

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,079
consultancy started off as a army of one

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,600
we worked our way up to a lot more than

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
that now uh we also have our own

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,280
conference which is part of where i feel

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,119
a particular affinity with pancakes con

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,040
because uh both

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,159
leslie and i saw the need to

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,520
really reach out help the rest of the

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,439
community

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,000
when um everything was getting kind of

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
swirly back a year ago

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,920
so um really feel the kindred spirit

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,119
there uh

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,720
spun a product startup out of that

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,960
called scythe which is an adversary

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,000
emulation platform

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,680
and then i co-founded the non-profit at

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,759
the ics village and then i do a bunch of

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,000
unicorn shenanigans

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,119
all right so goals for today one

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,159
reduce the haystack this is why we're

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,439
going to be talking about logging and

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,000
detection

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,240
engineering because we are always

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,560
looking for the needles in that haystack

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,159
sometimes there's not a needle but the

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,479
problem is that haystack is really big

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,880
so goal one for this talk is we're going

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,119
to try to give a brief overview

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,720
on how to reduce the size of the

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,200
haystack goal number two

52
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,360
we're going to eat well so it's women's

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,479
history month

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,280
month march and we're going to celebrate

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,560
julia child

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,759
who was very famous in bringing

57
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,160
french cuisine to the united states and

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,920
her signature dish that

59
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,280
started that was coco van

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,599
all right so metrics

61
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,680
metrics go along this maturity model

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,800
from logging

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,840
can i even see it all the way through

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,400
to being able to alert on that which is

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,239
a level of starting to bring human

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,519
interaction because we're establishing

67
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,120
correlation of events

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,760
putting it into the business terms uh i

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,920
note one 1060 here this concept is from

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,239
dimitri alperovitch from a few years ago

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,080
he notes this as this is the amount of

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
time for detection investigation

73
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,800
and response remediation that we need to

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,360
do

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,519
to be able to effectively contain an

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,480
adversary from

77
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,560
their breakout time now i note those as

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,000
goals because those are really

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,360
challenging to hit those

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,879
more importantly is just getting the

81
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,959
maturity to start to be able to measure

82
00:02:58,959 --> 00:02:59,519
them

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,840
will help us along that path and then

84
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,080
starting to turn that into a contextual

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
and continuous obviously is a phrase of

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,519
while things cannot be continuously done

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,720
um that we can get

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,120
more from snapshots to those snapshots

89
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,959
being like calculus where it averages

90
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,760
over time

91
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,879
and we can get much better insight

92
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,840
paul nelson one of those great

93
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,080
illuminati in cyber security

94
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,680
the truth is detecting threats is easy

95
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,879
identifying threats is hard and what

96
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,000
he's saying here is

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,200
that this is the haystack we can build

98
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,480
to the point where we're capturing

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,440
everything

100
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,000
but then being able to sift through that

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,480
in a

102
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,440
timely and effective manner is the hard

103
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,599
part because that's where the threat is

104
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,200
when is a screenshot not just a

105
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,519
screenshot we take screenshots all day

106
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,319
long

107
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,360
the context of a screenshot being

108
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,400
this is me doing something for me

109
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,560
and this is a malicious actor who's

110
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,480
using it to steal credentials

111
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,879
that context is what makes detection so

112
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,720
hard when it comes to

113
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,480
correlating that to an event where we

114
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,599
want to bring somebody because

115
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,439
something's suspicious

116
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,879
so at the top

117
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,040
i simplify the attack chain into three

118
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,478
elements

119
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,079
recon access post access i want to case

120
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,680
the joint i want to break into the joint

121
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,360
i want to steal the jewels

122
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,280
correlate that to the cyber defense

123
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,960
matrix if you haven't heard about sunil

124
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,520
you

125
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,080
sunil yu is one of the smartest people

126
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,280
in cyber security

127
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,240
bar none he's amazing and he came up

128
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
with this concept a few years ago at rsa

129
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,840
called the cyber defense matrix

130
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,919
where he splits the phases of a defender

131
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,440
from identify

132
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,520
what do i got 80 percent of cyber

133
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,560
security is

134
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
configuration management do i even know

135
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,600
what i have into

136
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,400
protecting denying access detecting

137
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,160
responding and recovering

138
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,759
across the categories of assets in our

139
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,560
company

140
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,639
which not only include the technical but

141
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,000
also the people

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,919
and so the key here is why detection is

143
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,120
so valuable

144
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,320
is it's the part that we can control

145
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
we have limited ability and there's

146
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
limited business value in being able to

147
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,120
affect

148
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
what can be seen about me and denying an

149
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,880
attacker the perimeter

150
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,560
is dead the detection aspect is what do

151
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,120
we do

152
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,360
afterward every attacker has to be

153
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,199
visible at some level afterward

154
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,880
and what are the things in our control

155
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,720
that we can do that and it starts with

156
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,759
establishing again

157
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,240
what can we see correlating that and

158
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,199
starting to go to

159
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,479
more advanced analytics so

160
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,320
why why are we doing this first of all

161
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,680
lots of tools

162
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,919
something like 50 of all tools in

163
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,120
aggregate are either

164
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,440
bought and not installed or they're just

165
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,160
installed with the default configuration

166
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,000
we're talking about security tools here

167
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,280
well

168
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,960
none of those are going to work they're

169
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,479
not going to detect anything

170
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,080
no matter what the vendor tells you and

171
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,840
this is where i think the snake oil

172
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,880
comment about vendors

173
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,319
is not quite fair is most of the time a

174
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,160
vendor has sold you a correct bill of

175
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,960
goods

176
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,600
the challenge is it has to be put into

177
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,240
your

178
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,000
context we need to take what this can do

179
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,400
and tune it for you and so that's where

180
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,759
we're going to provide an overview here

181
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,840
on how to do that

182
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,680
threat intelligence is primarily stale

183
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,240
iocs and signature driven approaches

184
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,759
we all know the pyramid of pain i think

185
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,360
it's mandatory that we say two things in

186
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,280
every presentation we talk about david

187
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,440
bianco's pyramid of pain and we give a

188
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,919
call out to mitre's attack framework

189
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,440
the problem is that we are still

190
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,120
primarily stuck at the bottom

191
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,759
of discovering yesterday to detect

192
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,479
tomorrow

193
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,840
and the reality is we're always going to

194
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,080
be behind on that one of the things that

195
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,759
we're going to talk about today that is

196
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,720
going to provide

197
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,560
very rich insight is cismod microsoft is

198
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
the largest surface area in enterprise

199
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,280
id

200
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,520
microsoft has done a phenomenal job with

201
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,120
their security program

202
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,759
but they are the largest target almost

203
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,880
everybody uses them

204
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,000
there are very few environments that

205
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,080
don't have microsoft sysmond

206
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,960
is a fantastic and most importantly free

207
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
tool to help us do that

208
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,479
so we're going to go from not just being

209
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,560
able to see but to provide context to it

210
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,720
and part of that is because attackers

211
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,360
are always changing

212
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,080
payloads can be polymorphic they're

213
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,280
looking and understanding that

214
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,720
signatures are what you're looking for

215
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,919
so that's something that they're moving

216
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,280
beyond

217
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
impact defeats so the way that we

218
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,199
signature in an environment they can

219
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,319
defeat that

220
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,039
and then we always see this ability for

221
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,639
them to take derivatives

222
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,240
where a successful tool set payload

223
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,360
will be derived from built upon and fork

224
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,840
out in different directions

225
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,120
so one doing this you will get an

226
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,080
immediate return

227
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,879
on implementing these detections it will

228
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,599
save you

229
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,680
time this is the biggest thing because

230
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,599
we're all so busy

231
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,360
there aren't enough of us and there's

232
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
more than enough work and we're always

233
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,039
behind the curve

234
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,319
while this seems like a little bit of

235
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,639
extra effort to begin with i promise you

236
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,520
it will pay

237
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,680
dividends in saving you time in the long

238
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,639
run

239
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,479
and i also want to call out an owasp

240
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,080
that one of their top 10

241
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,120
is insufficient logging and monitoring

242
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,120
um i didn't mention this at the

243
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,479
beginning but you'll notice here that

244
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,360
this is uh

245
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,080
underlined so all of my slides i will

246
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,120
have urls

247
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,199
to sources i will have urls to more

248
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,560
information

249
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,319
and i will share the slides after this

250
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,759
presentation i will also be in the

251
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,039
pancakes con

252
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,080
slack afterward to answer questions uh

253
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,839
and then i have an entire resource

254
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,719
section with

255
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,360
all sorts of a lot more information

256
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,958
because i can only cover so much in 20

257
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,958
so minutes um

258
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,120
and with that with that you can take

259
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,240
what you want and go

260
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,000
a deep dive even further with what i'm

261
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,760
sharing here today

262
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,200
uh if you haven't heard about detect

263
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,080
detect is this alternate perspective of

264
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,640
attack

265
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,399
based on the fact that the blue team

266
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,560
needs its own method for looking at data

267
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,320
sources to establish visibility into

268
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,680
detection

269
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,440
i have the link in here so feel free to

270
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,800
check that out for more

271
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,880
all right so our starting problem

272
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,080
especially with

273
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,680
windows logs is the event logs

274
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,519
suck there's just not a lot of data to

275
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,560
work with

276
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,480
so when we look at the foundation of a

277
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,760
building that we're trying to

278
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,720
take up to a skyscraper it's really hard

279
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,399
to build this with the default event

280
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,080
logs that exist

281
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,680
i have a snapshot in here because i

282
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,440
can't go back and forth between

283
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,040
the m's in my kitchen in enough time

284
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,959
here so you can kind of see

285
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,560
looking in here there's a basic amount

286
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,160
of information in your average

287
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,640
windows event log but there's not a lot

288
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,680
to work from

289
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,600
so we need higher fidelity logging

290
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,040
one of the first things that you can do

291
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,200
is there's some edits inside windows so

292
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,480
in group policy and

293
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
administrative templates that can enrich

294
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,160
those data sources

295
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,399
so we can capture even more information

296
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,880
and then there's cis mod so if you

297
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,080
haven't heard about cismod

298
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,680
sysmon is awesome it provides

299
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,600
rich detailed information on the host

300
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,480
um you'll note here this is 13.01 this

301
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,600
is the latest version

302
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,519
the reason i took a snapshot here is to

303
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,440
show that the

304
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,040
they're still maintaining and keeping

305
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,360
this up so here we are the last one was

306
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,240
in january

307
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,320
um the additional element that they

308
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,920
added so the way that cisbond works is

309
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,399
it has

310
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,640
event ids uh the last one that they

311
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,040
added is number 25

312
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,600
which uh allows you to detect process

313
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,240
hollowing

314
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,440
i mean that's pretty cool um

315
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,079
so why first of all it's free again we

316
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,040
love free free is a great starting point

317
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,519
it's lightweight and it's native this

318
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,640
isn't yet another

319
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,480
third-party driver that you're trying to

320
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,720
install that's going to constantly break

321
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,680
every time that microsoft is pushing out

322
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
a patch or an update

323
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,480
is has tons of logs to build custom

324
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,360
detections

325
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,279
this is a great tool to start with and

326
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,600
then to be able to tune

327
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
it's really easy to tune it has a very

328
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,640
flexible language

329
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,240
it allows you to be selective about

330
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,000
what's interesting you and to eliminate

331
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,959
noise

332
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,760
in the resource section i'm going to

333
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,600
post the links to

334
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,320
uh two really great uh sysmon

335
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,279
configurations

336
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,000
one from uh one of the smartest guys i

337
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,839
know in the detection space that's olaf

338
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,800
hartong

339
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,040
um called sysmon modular and then of

340
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,480
course swift on security

341
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,079
there's some differences between the two

342
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,760
unfortunately i don't have time to to go

343
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,200
through those but the point is

344
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,120
those are great starting points and even

345
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,640
with those they're

346
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,040
they're a tuned element to capture a

347
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,079
certain amount but

348
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,680
these are going to be generating a

349
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,120
certain amount of data

350
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,440
and what is of interest to you is

351
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,560
something that you want to take that

352
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,079
next step but those are great starting

353
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,399
points

354
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,360
there we go all right so so best

355
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,000
practices um make sure you're archiving

356
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,200
your sysmon files

357
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,760
versions uh microsoft does not make

358
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,440
previous versions available

359
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,600
uh so uh going back to again

360
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,519
configuration management for assets

361
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,320
you're going to want to apply

362
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,440
configuration management for cispond

363
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,880
so that you know exactly what it's doing

364
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,839
for that logging uh 10.0 is different

365
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,120
than 13.0

366
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,560
and knowing that there are different

367
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,959
versions and your ability to track that

368
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,480
for what you're using in your enterprise

369
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,519
is going to be important it's going to

370
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,399
be on

371
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,480
uh it's going to be on you um as a part

372
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,760
of your install and upgrade

373
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,519
uh script you're going to make sure that

374
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,760
you want to be checking that version

375
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,839
so that you're you're doing what you

376
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,279
want to do

377
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,519
um all right some install options

378
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,160
so just uh real quick uh

379
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,440
yeah we'll just say that but one of the

380
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,800
cool things i thought about this

381
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,920
is that you can obfuscate sysfont so as

382
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,279
somebody who has always been

383
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,120
on the offensive security side for his

384
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,480
career

385
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,680
the attacker is really good

386
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,040
at being able to turn whatever is static

387
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,360
in a defense into our test matrix

388
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,600
we take that down we reverse engineer it

389
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,200
and we test what we're going to do

390
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,440
before we go into your environment

391
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,360
obfuscating cismod is just one of those

392
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,200
things that adds a little bit of an

393
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,079
extra mix

394
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,839
right i don't know that you're using

395
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,000
cismod i know it when i do an

396
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,720
enumeration of a host and i see

397
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,360
cisbond.drv

398
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,920
loaded on the other hand if it's called

399
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,720
something else

400
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,639
then that's not going to be necessarily

401
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,480
as apparent it takes an extra step for

402
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,920
me to learn this so

403
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,560
just a little extra hint there that

404
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,160
being able to obfuscate this is

405
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,320
something that adds a little bit more

406
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,360
difficulty

407
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,959
and provides assurance that your eyes

408
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,079
will be still there and able to work to

409
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,760
track what you want although it does

410
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,680
have an eight character limit

411
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,880
so once we load cisbond i'm a big fan of

412
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,480
check your work as you go so we can see

413
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,240
that sysmon is running here

414
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,839
in events uh syspod logs if you remember

415
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,279
just a few minutes ago we were showing

416
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,800
the windows event log and how windows

417
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,680
event log

418
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
was not as rich in information here in

419
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,959
sysfond we get a

420
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,519
whole bunch more information that we can

421
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,639
uh pull out

422
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
uh in this example uh specifically we're

423
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,920
looking at

424
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,399
event id one which is process creation

425
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,000
so we're now tracking down to

426
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,079
specific specific events that are

427
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,360
happening on the host

428
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,440
and a level of rich data that is coming

429
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,120
with each one of those events

430
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,360
and so it's already easier to splice our

431
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,040
data

432
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,199
now of course we need some way to be

433
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,680
able to ingest and analyze this data

434
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,160
one of the most popular tools out there

435
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
is elk which stands for elasticsearch

436
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,000
logstash and cabana

437
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,320
it's free it's open source i note that

438
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,839
everything has a price

439
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,440
and part of that price is going to come

440
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,040
with the fact that

441
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,399
elk is powerful but elk can start to get

442
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,399
uh difficult to use in certain

443
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,240
circumstances and can be

444
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,519
a little a little touchy but for a

445
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,320
starting point

446
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,920
this is a great thing to work with in a

447
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,600
lab because it's free and it's open

448
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,399
source

449
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,440
it's the kind of thing that you can

450
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,959
build and tune and deploy to an

451
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,720
environment to get you going

452
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,560
um but out of the gate we're getting

453
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,480
centralized scalable

454
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,800
data store for us to do analysis which

455
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
is key for us to do that detection

456
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,760
engineering

457
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,480
so we've got something like sysbond

458
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,560
which is enriching our logging at the

459
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,360
source

460
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,880
we're going to use something like beats

461
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,480
in this case wind log beats

462
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
to pipe that information into a

463
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,320
centralized data store so we have all of

464
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,560
our endpoints combining that information

465
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,759
now we have this ability to splice this

466
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,360
data any way that we want

467
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,120
and then kibana is there for us to be

468
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,120
able to visualize this so it's a lot

469
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,600
easier to look at

470
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,160
so i talked about when log b when log b

471
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,360
is how we're getting the information off

472
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,120
the system

473
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,839
uh really easy to install with

474
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,040
administrator privilege

475
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,360
powershell running the script

476
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,680
reconfiguring the yml file

477
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,920
make sure to check your configuration uh

478
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,959
there is

479
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,440
in my resource section uh there is a

480
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,959
command to be able to check your

481
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,399
configuration to make sure that it's

482
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,440
kosher

483
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,399
i will give the warning that this is

484
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,040
very

485
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,959
space sensitive so the configuration

486
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,639
file requires everything to be exactly

487
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,320
where it's looking for it

488
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,079
even one space off and it won't parse

489
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,519
correctly um

490
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,720
restart sysfon restart wind log b uh and

491
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,279
just

492
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,639
for note as you're going through the

493
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,199
installation a pro tip

494
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,680
rename the installation directory for

495
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,600
ease of use what i mean by that is when

496
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,279
you unpack the initial zip

497
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,560
it's going to come out with this really

498
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,800
long directory title including with

499
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,600
dashes

500
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,279
and of course if you're working in linux

501
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,360
that can be a little tricky

502
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,880
so just simplify it

503
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,440
all right something else to consider is

504
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,560
that with cisbond

505
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,639
you're going to want to have different

506
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,680
configurations

507
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,240
for different assets what you're looking

508
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,920
for on a server is going to be different

509
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
than what you're looking on a user host

510
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,000
and then whatever asset categories that

511
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,839
you have going back to that comment

512
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,600
about configuration management this is

513
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,120
where this starts to get sticky

514
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,040
not only can there be different versions

515
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,559
of the sysmond driver working in our

516
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,520
environment

517
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
there can also be different

518
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,919
configurations of what cismod is doing

519
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,439
on different hosts

520
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,119
so being able to track all that is going

521
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,679
to be really critical for us

522
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,000
all right so some final thoughts make

523
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,520
sure that you're testing first

524
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,559
in a lab so working very simply

525
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,079
building it up making sure that when you

526
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,599
go to a production environment you're

527
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,120
not overwhelming yourself at the end of

528
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,039
the day our goal is to reduce the size

529
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,000
of the haystack

530
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,840
not just add all of the data to begin

531
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,120
with so

532
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,200
visibility is great we want to reduce

533
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
that visibility over time

534
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,240
elk is resource hungry you're going to

535
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,799
need a lot of ram

536
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,240
storage gets really big really

537
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,080
fast so this is part of what you want to

538
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,280
see in your environment

539
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,559
is when you're testing how much am i

540
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,360
generating

541
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,960
per host with average traffic

542
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,559
um and what's really happening in the

543
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,240
environment can shift that

544
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,440
so uh on average you can expect a host

545
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
to probably take anywhere from like

546
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,400
10 to at a top maybe 40 or 50 megabytes

547
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,600
per day

548
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,679
as as i said here that can add up real

549
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,760
fast and then on the other side is data

550
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,640
retention

551
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,400
as we well know uh it usually takes some

552
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,840
time to be able to find

553
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,320
a breach afterward so the amount of data

554
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,919
that we have for as long as we can have

555
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,400
that data

556
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,520
that's what helps us look back

557
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,360
historically to identify that first

558
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,480
point

559
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
so data retention is a challenge here

560
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,440
because you're always going to be in

561
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,559
this balance of

562
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,080
of course i went as much as possible

563
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,880
versus the cost of maintaining that

564
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,280
almost all of these platforms uh there

565
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
is a cloud element to it which of course

566
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,200
they will happily charge you more

567
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,240
uh to keep things longer and then again

568
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,520
we talked about the challenges around

569
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,360
configuration management so

570
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,240
something you want to plan for up front

571
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,280
all right

572
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,000
if you don't know this cyber wardog

573
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,559
created

574
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,600
a packaged version of elk called

575
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,880
hulk help is a very very

576
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,240
easy way to get started in a lab

577
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,799
you just do a git clone you pull down

578
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,520
from the link

579
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,280
i have the the email and excuse me i

580
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,120
have the url here so you can go through

581
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,960
that he has a bunch of instructions

582
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,480
um the only uh advice that i would give

583
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:22,960
here

584
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,679
is make sure you're starting from a

585
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,840
clean linux install

586
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,039
this is the kind of thing where you're

587
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,640
working with somebody else's package

588
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,000
dependencies that

589
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,280
are not anticipated can break things

590
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,720
so this is a great

591
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,919
start to getting something in a lab and

592
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,080
getting going and all the visualizations

593
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,120
and all the indexing

594
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,039
is already built in there uh one of the

595
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,720
other things that he includes for you

596
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,080
is our sigma rules so sigma rules are

597
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,120
yaml files that are a way to share um

598
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,440
the way logging is described

599
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
and so i just have some snapshots here

600
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,120
where you can look inside

601
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,960
of the helk distro and actually see

602
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,760
where he has already built in in this

603
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,240
case

604
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,159
um you know for example powershell

605
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,360
detection

606
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,559
and and elsas here for event id10

607
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,200
um and oh right i also forgot that he

608
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,159
also included

609
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,760
automatically tagging all of these

610
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,919
events into the miter attack framework

611
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:22,640
so

612
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,280
uh out of the box you're already getting

613
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,360
a pretty mature perspective on being

614
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,480
able to how to index

615
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,760
and analyze the data there's

616
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,080
links okay there's always a butt uh one

617
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,440
of the other ones is soft

618
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,799
elk which is created by the great folks

619
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,440
over at sands

620
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,200
i've always talked about context i

621
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,360
started this talking about context

622
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,240
these are great tools just like the fact

623
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,679
that we have security tools your

624
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,760
analytic tools need to be geared

625
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,000
toward your environment and what works

626
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,120
for you

627
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,600
so these are awesome things but if you

628
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,880
were just to deploy them into your

629
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,840
environment

630
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,440
we get to that data storage and

631
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,120
retention problem right something that

632
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
works well for one machine

633
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,720
or 10 machines or 100 machines might not

634
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,240
scale as easily if you have a large

635
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,880
environment

636
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,280
of 10 000 plus machines or 100 000 plus

637
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,159
machines

638
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,159
so being able to really look at a

639
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,440
fine-tuned perspective of

640
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,280
what's important to you based on the

641
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,200
natural activities of your environment

642
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,880
and how much data that's creating is key

643
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,480
before you just push it into production

644
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,880
all right so one of the ways to do that

645
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,480
is we need to create

646
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,799
a functional signal and this is what the

647
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,080
red team does

648
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,320
is finding a way to establish context by

649
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,720
using

650
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,960
apt grouping or adversary emulation to

651
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,080
drive that

652
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,159
so my setup here we're going to have an

653
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,440
attack server

654
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,080
going after a windows target with a

655
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,280
linux box with help

656
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,600
pulling that information again this is

657
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,200
where log beats comes in

658
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,240
and conducting the analysis what you're

659
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,360
using to attack

660
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,960
can be anything so if you haven't heard

661
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,919
about the c2 matrix uh the c2 matrix is

662
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,960
a project that i

663
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,000
worked out with uh george ortiz and adam

664
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,320
schinchy over at red canary where we

665
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,400
just built the largest compendium of all

666
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,559
of the c2 tools that are available

667
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,720
some of them are commercial most of them

668
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,320
are free and open source

669
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,799
we have over 60 c2 platforms in there

670
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,480
there's a decision tool that allows you

671
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,360
to go in and say

672
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,520
what am i trying to test and it'll

673
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,200
automatically spin that up

674
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,720
one of the things that george did in

675
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,440
collaboration with the sands institute

676
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,559
was create a linux vm called sans

677
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,600
slingshot that has

678
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,320
a number of those free c2 platforms

679
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,480
already built and installed for you

680
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,960
so that's a great resource to start to

681
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,000
work again for

682
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,280
free to drive the detection engineering

683
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,400
for you

684
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,799
all right so what we're doing here is

685
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,159
start basic

686
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,679
so in this case we're creating a basic

687
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,000
payload um what we're trying to do

688
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,679
is through user execution using run

689
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:56,159
dll32

690
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,480
uh if you're not familiar with law base

691
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,280
law bas

692
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,600
is the fact that there are a number of

693
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,440
binaries that have already been

694
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,919
uh seen as benign so they're allowed

695
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,280
listed in the environment

696
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,120
attackers love those because those are a

697
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,280
great way for us to use those to spawn

698
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,880
our own processes because

699
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,640
the operating system is going to think

700
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,320
it's okay

701
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,039
we get in we get started and then we

702
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,960
establish our command and control

703
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
i recommend something like https to

704
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,520
start https is i believe about

705
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,640
60 to 70 of the

706
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,799
of all attacks the most common uh

707
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,400
protocol that we see

708
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,480
it's a little bit harder than http of

709
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,440
course because

710
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,320
it's encrypted and so this forces you to

711
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,200
look at

712
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,600
what you're able to do in terms of

713
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,559
either are you

714
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,840
intercepting certificates or are you

715
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,919
uh looking at the metadata to establish

716
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,760
network traffic activity back to host

717
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,279
activity

718
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,120
to correlate that context understanding

719
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,960
an attacker

720
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,720
doing something really simple again

721
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,320
running who am i

722
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,840
if you haven't played our red team

723
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,679
arcade game that was created by tim

724
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,640
malcolmbetter

725
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,480
over at the red team lead over at

726
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,559
fortune one as he likes to describe

727
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,600
um who am i is a

728
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,279
very benign request but

729
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,159
is it how many users even know what who

730
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:16,720
am i

731
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,799
is right if we were to look at our

732
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,760
entire group

733
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,679
chances are there's a very select group

734
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,279
that would even know what that is

735
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,880
which means it would be very suspicious

736
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
for them anybody to run that

737
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
and even those that are authorized to

738
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,000
run it

739
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,039
seeing that they are is a questionable

740
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:33,760
thing

741
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,240
attackers don't know where they start

742
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,919
they basically come into an environment

743
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:38,720
blind

744
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,559
who am i is a great starting point of

745
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,480
like all right well like

746
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,000
what host am i on what does this mean in

747
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,760
the network that i first started at

748
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
so it's a it's a good basic step to

749
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,039
begin to

750
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,400
see what i could log and start

751
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,240
establishing that correlation of what

752
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,480
that means in our environment

753
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,720
and then um we are executing a

754
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,840
powershell payload

755
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,440
from windows registry because uh most

756
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,720
malware today is fileless it resides in

757
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,840
memory only

758
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,080
uh the days of things going and touching

759
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,360
disk immediately

760
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,039
are pretty much gone because of course

761
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,440
that's a lot easier to work with

762
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,520
something that touches with disk creates

763
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,080
a forensic artifact that i can begin to

764
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,200
track and work with

765
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,679
so attackers know this and being able to

766
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,400
conduct

767
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,159
forensics analysis and understanding and

768
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,400
memory is a much harder problem

769
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
and this is a a good baseline to kind of

770
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,520
get started with

771
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,799
what's important and of course you're

772
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,640
going to want to work through the

773
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,120
law base of different ways to start

774
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,320
these invocations

775
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,760
there are many different communication

776
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,799
protocols besides https

777
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,799
and then of course there are a lot of

778
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,640
benign commands that we can run from the

779
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,520
command line

780
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,440
that we want to be able to take a look

781
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,360
at what those mean and then from there

782
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,640
we start graduating ourselves up to more

783
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,360
complex

784
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,159
apts to emulate to understand what would

785
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:56,559
happen

786
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,440
against a stealthier and more difficult

787
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,960
adversary

788
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,279
uh so from the who am i for example

789
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,720
we're going to go into kibana

790
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,039
we can see that by looking at that what

791
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,720
kinds of things we've seen and start to

792
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,600
build

793
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,720
those correlations for that

794
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,799
another free tool that i'm a big fan of

795
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:15,919
is vector

796
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,840
so we can import in vector

797
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,679
those ttps that we've ran from that

798
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,840
campaign of course this is pretty simple

799
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,960
and now we have

800
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,840
a it gives us a few things uh it is a

801
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,159
good

802
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,400
process flow for red and blue to work

803
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,600
together to determine

804
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,760
what was detected at one point and it

805
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,279
gives us those simple metrics of

806
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,679
understanding detection percentages

807
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,679
so we didn't detect anything as a

808
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,720
baseline

809
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,600
um oh all right well let's let's install

810
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,640
sysmon

811
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,559
let's enable event id with process

812
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,320
creation so we're detecting these kinds

813
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,880
of

814
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,520
the creation of those executables run it

815
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,159
again

816
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,960
and we can start to see improvements in

817
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,400
our visibility so

818
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,360
really simple easy overview of detection

819
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,559
engineering

820
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,760
to get to 9000 on your own continue

821
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,520
testing so that's snapshot uh is

822
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,799
showing the basics of where we began

823
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,559
but if i've seen anything about security

824
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,360
in my career security is a constant

825
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,840
fight against gravity

826
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,080
whatever worked today at some point will

827
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,440
break

828
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,360
and our ability to continue to make sure

829
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,520
that the work that we put in to achieve

830
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,080
this level

831
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,240
is maintained means we need to continue

832
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,919
to check those baselines

833
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,919
the good part is from a people process

834
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,159
and technology side of doing this

835
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,559
it gets faster and it gets easier and so

836
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,720
as you continue to build the plateaus

837
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
through much more mature detection

838
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,240
engineering

839
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,240
validating that you haven't lost ground

840
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,919
is what helps you continue to

841
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,200
that momentum to better security um

842
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,039
as you can see this was primarily host

843
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,240
level focused

844
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,120
um you want to add the network level of

845
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,520
this

846
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,159
so it's that combination not just of

847
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,760
isolated host incidents

848
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,720
but starting to look at host activities

849
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,760
or hosts

850
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,159
activities tied to specific network

851
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,279
detections

852
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,320
um that is going to take this to another

853
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,200
level

854
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,039
a great example of this like is

855
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,799
solarwinds right so everybody's been

856
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,000
talking about that for months

857
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,159
now and why not let's talk about it a

858
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,039
little bit more

859
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,159
um this one of the weaknesses of

860
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,240
solar winds and this is the challenge

861
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,520
for most adversaries

862
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,760
is while their initial bounce points are

863
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,600
going to be as close as possible to the

864
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,240
host

865
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,600
and typically they're going to be cloud

866
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,279
hosters in the united states

867
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,480
the end adversary is not last time i

868
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,960
checked

869
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,360
uh i haven't seen the gru or svb set up

870
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,559
around here

871
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,200
they're still somewhere else and so one

872
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,559
of the ways that you can look at network

873
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,320
traffic to identify these things

874
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,960
is um that initial call to what's

875
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,520
probably

876
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,080
looks like a benign host there is a

877
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,640
longer

878
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,120
round trip than would be expected for a

879
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,000
response

880
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,679
because that's just an initial bounce

881
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,600
node as it goes through its

882
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,360
c2 network back to the c2 host

883
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,840
and so that longer amount of time is a

884
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,200
giveaway at the network level that

885
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,279
something is a little odd happening

886
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,799
um we talked about increasing the

887
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,480
sophistication level uh

888
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,600
and then in terms of leveraging

889
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,679
adversary emulation plans uh

890
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,000
this is something uh that we do and

891
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,039
share freely so

892
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,840
go check it out uh on our github uh it's

893
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,760
just json's where we break down

894
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,360
the the latest threats that we're seeing

895
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,880
into ttps

896
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,039
and then of course mitre attack is the

897
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,320
golden resource for

898
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,799
a lot of that group intel and insights

899
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,480
and there are a lot of other folks that

900
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,080
do a lot of great work on this

901
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,440
um so just look for uh those sources

902
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,000
that are out there

903
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,880
they're all free and pull together and

904
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,000
share with the community

905
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,039
as we go all right so

906
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,600
moving on to the cooking part

907
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,360
we talked about that security is best

908
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,559
with wine

909
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,880
so is cooking and since it's women's

910
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,240
history month

911
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,840
we're going to talk about one of the

912
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,480
great female chefs of all time and that

913
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,000
is julia child uh julia child uh

914
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,720
was one of the first to help bring uh

915
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,760
french cuisine

916
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,919
to united states she did this co-writing

917
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,600
a book called mastering the art of

918
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,039
french cooking which was released in

919
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,159
1961

920
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,919
and then in 1963 on pbs she went on to

921
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,919
create her own cooking show called the

922
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:24,640
french

923
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,000
chef which went on for about a decade

924
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,520
now the thing about this is that one

925
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,559
wine should be involved

926
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,640
and two people hear french cooking and

927
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,399
go whoa

928
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,080
that sounds hard i don't want to do that

929
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,279
we're going to make it easy we've got 20

930
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,799
minutes

931
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,799
and we're gonna walk through the basics

932
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,080
of making a

933
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,399
an awesome almost the first one pot meal

934
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,600
uh which is coco van i'm a big fan of

935
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,440
one pots because i don't like

936
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,240
to clean as much as i need you know i

937
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,080
keep keep the cleaning simple

938
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,440
excuse me all right so coke event

939
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,000
translates directly as rooster and wine

940
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,640
of course

941
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,880
chicken um really simple

942
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,559
render bacon brown the chicken

943
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,919
skin side down saute onions garlic

944
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,679
and whatever savories we want to add

945
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,519
what's the savory

946
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,600
thyme rosemary sage

947
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,720
savory herbs combine with

948
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,240
chicken stock and cover let that sit for

949
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,360
a while

950
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,480
add mushrooms and carrots

951
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,320
whisk in some flour to thicken up the

952
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,519
sauce

953
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,320
let it sit for as long as you want and

954
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,039
that's it

955
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,399
this is that easy so

956
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,159
um one of the things i like about this

957
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,919
dish is it can go

958
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,559
with a lot of different things you can

959
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,640
use different kinds of wine

960
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,919
and it gets better over time

961
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,519
so i started this this morning

962
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,600
[Music]

963
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,519
there we go see it's over there the red

964
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,880
pot going

965
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,840
uh just uh to make it easier because uh

966
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,440
trying to cook and do all of this in

967
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,039
this cadets time period is difficult

968
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,559
just like i wasn't showing vms i did

969
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,440
snapshots

970
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,720
so we're gonna do the same thing for the

971
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,440
food all right step zero

972
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,080
pour some wine

973
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,320
cheers

974
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,320
quick shout out to this knife uh this is

975
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,919
a custom sentoku

976
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,159
that blenster's father made for me you

977
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,600
can actually see his name

978
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,639
is engraved on it

979
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,559
so i've uh trying to highlight this

980
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,760
whatever possible and i know on

981
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,120
glenster's twitter

982
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,480
uh he has um some additional knives that

983
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,919
he's highlighting right now so check

984
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:04,480
those out

985
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,120
they are well made all right step one

986
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,840
render

987
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,960
the bacon so what we're doing here is

988
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,559
we are pulling the fat the grease out of

989
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,880
the bacon

990
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,679
traditional french cooking has lots of

991
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,640
butter

992
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,320
i actually didn't use any butter in this

993
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,919
recipe because of the approach that i

994
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,200
did with both the bacon

995
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
and the chicken is i use the natural fat

996
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,640
that's in both of those

997
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,440
to form the base to cook for this the

998
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,399
holy trinity

999
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,679
is garlic onion and a fat

1000
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,480
cooking with that will achieve just

1001
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,080
unbelievable results

1002
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,919
so once we've rendered this out so you

1003
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,080
can see here we've got the oil here

1004
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,360
in the pan um the pan

1005
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,519
you want it to be a pot that's large

1006
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,799
enough because this is kind of

1007
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,080
this is this is like a large stew um

1008
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,080
so if you start with something too small

1009
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,679
you're gonna have a hard time always

1010
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,600
start with a bigger pot that you need

1011
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,360
and you'll find that more often than not

1012
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,799
you fill it all the way up

1013
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,480
after we've rendered our bacon we pull

1014
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,280
it out let it sit

1015
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,679
then brown the chicken so two things

1016
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,639
here

1017
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,960
um

1018
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,040
americans tend to like chicken breasts

1019
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,560
without the skin

1020
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,839
it's it's uh it's just an easy chicken

1021
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:24,879
to work with

1022
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,599
and that will work for this um the

1023
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,280
difference being is you're not going to

1024
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,239
want to

1025
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,440
brown it the same way you can you can

1026
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,040
kiss it on both sides to make it easier

1027
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,320
to chop but at the end of the day for

1028
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,440
that i recommend just

1029
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
chopping it and throwing it in because

1030
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,800
once you get it into a stew

1031
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,760
everything just cooks out and i really

1032
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,480
like

1033
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,359
um chicken thighs with the skin on um

1034
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,119
this is the same thing for duck

1035
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,679
cook it skin side down that fat will

1036
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,199
pull out of the skin

1037
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,079
you get a really really nice crisp brown

1038
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,160
um did i have any

1039
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,119
no i didn't sorry i i meant to include a

1040
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,320
picture of the

1041
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,240
the brown skin it gets this really

1042
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,640
really pretty golden brown color on the

1043
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,280
skin

1044
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,880
uh we'll see it when i played it um

1045
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,520
and so we're pulling pulling that out uh

1046
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,880
the other thing i wanted to talk about

1047
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,200
here

1048
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,880
is so uh these cuts of meat are also

1049
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,720
not as expensive because they're not as

1050
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,560
popular so

1051
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,680
uh for example the leg quarters they got

1052
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,800
here which are the thigh with the

1053
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,160
drumstick attached

1054
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,200
i think we're like 79 cents a pound and

1055
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,359
the trick to uh cutting the meat up

1056
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,440
is you just come at an angle about where

1057
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,040
the joint is and you just come in at a

1058
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,079
diagonal

1059
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,000
and the two will split apart like that

1060
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,280
so this is something else i think a lot

1061
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,800
of people are a little intimidated by

1062
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,480
cutting this and you can see it's

1063
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,920
actually not that hard

1064
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,680
takes a little bit of practice but a

1065
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,760
good sturdy knife that right angle cut

1066
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
and it comes right apart and we've got

1067
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,599
our chicken all ready for us

1068
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,040
why pay somebody else to do it we can do

1069
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,680
it ourselves then we saute

1070
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,760
so uh i am a huge fan of what i call

1071
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,960
the rustic cut uh

1072
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,800
mincing onions there are some techniques

1073
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
to mince onions really easily

1074
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,839
same thing with garlic how i did this

1075
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,920
i did a rough chop of the onions i did a

1076
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,280
rough chop of my fennel

1077
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,280
and the garlic i actually threw in whole

1078
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,119
cloves of the garlic because when it

1079
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,160
cooks this long

1080
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,079
the garlic just achieves this perfect

1081
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,599
consistency and you wouldn't even mind

1082
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,880
getting a whole bite of it it's not like

1083
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,079
the

1084
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,839
like really pungent garlic bite that you

1085
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,480
get it's actually a lot of this like

1086
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,079
sort of sophisticated garlic like sorry

1087
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,359
more like sophisticated um umami of like

1088
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,560
sweetness

1089
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,920
so using a whole garlic is not a problem

1090
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
trick question how much garlic is too

1091
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,960
much garlic

1092
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,320
there is never enough i believe julia's

1093
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,760
original epi

1094
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,240
recipe called for four cloves with

1095
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,760
several pounds of chicken

1096
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,400
um i think i probably have about 16

1097
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,920
cloves in here

1098
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,119
bonus you keep the vampires away one of

1099
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,320
the other things that i like to do

1100
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,000
that's a neat trick

1101
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,200
is time so with time

1102
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,599
so this is out of my garden is the easy

1103
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,599
way to

1104
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,359
strip time is you just hold it and you

1105
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,960
just pull it down and those leaves will

1106
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,000
come right off

1107
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,760
however i really like the extra flavor

1108
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,200
that comes with the fact that i've been

1109
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,480
letting this braise for

1110
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,480
for several hours so i throw the whole

1111
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,920
thing in there with

1112
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,400
the leaves still on it's really easy to

1113
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,440
pull them out

1114
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,720
and i feel like you just get a little

1115
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,560
bit extra flavor from using the entire

1116
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,880
herb

1117
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,160
all right so after we've cooked so that

1118
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,920
our garlic our onion

1119
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,560
and our fennel has kind of opened up

1120
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,240
deglaze the pan so we're going to still

1121
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,839
have from earlier when we browned our

1122
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:46,400
chicken

1123
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,520
you know actually you can see some of

1124
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,680
the the really pretty browning on the

1125
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,000
top

1126
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,720
there of the chicken and you know

1127
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,079
sometimes the skin gets pulled off a

1128
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:54,880
little bit

1129
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,960
it's cooking just doesn't have to be

1130
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,000
perfect

1131
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,320
pour the wine in scrape those bits off

1132
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,599
pour a little bit more wine in scrape

1133
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,200
the bits off let it cook for a little

1134
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,119
bit and then we're going to throw

1135
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,320
everything in here so

1136
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,040
tear the bacon back up throw it in here

1137
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,280
pour more wine

1138
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,079
chicken stock

1139
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,280
and then the mushrooms the carrots

1140
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,119
whatever else you want to throw in there

1141
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,240
one of the other things that could be

1142
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,320
good in here is celery

1143
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,040
and this is the best part then is we

1144
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,520
just cover the pot and we let it sit

1145
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,240
so my pot has been sitting now for

1146
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,599
almost three hours

1147
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,040
so this would be the part where you get

1148
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,119
to sit back in your kitchen and just

1149
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,040
have a drink smile at the family

1150
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,040
and while we're waiting to do that we're

1151
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,320
going to talk a little bit about some

1152
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,040
wine

1153
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,359
so why uh wine is one of those things

1154
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,960
that i think people

1155
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,960
have kind of built up a bit more of it

1156
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,720
just like french cuisine

1157
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,800
we think it's so fancy and we build all

1158
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,160
of it up when actually

1159
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,079
the french were some of the best that

1160
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,920
just hey this is what i got available

1161
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,119
let's throw it together

1162
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,560
let's cook it for a long time a lot of

1163
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,480
fat and we're done that's pretty much

1164
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,839
french cuisine

1165
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,480
wine wine is kind of the same thing well

1166
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,760
not the same thing in that way but

1167
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,680
metaphorically the same thing

1168
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,200
where what we're doing is it's meant

1169
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,280
to help bring a group together

1170
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
and i know that's hard in the pandemic

1171
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,560
but

1172
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,720
i've got some tricks here that so i'm a

1173
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
household of of one

1174
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,040
adult uh where a bottle of wine

1175
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,640
i will show you a trick on how that you

1176
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,720
don't have to try to drink it all in the

1177
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,320
night because that's not good

1178
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,800
um as well as using it in the cooking

1179
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,040
like we've been doing so

1180
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,440
the temperature of wine matters um if

1181
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,160
you

1182
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,240
have watched my don't fight your whiskey

1183
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,240
talk at cocktail con

1184
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,079
uh the temperature of a liquid is going

1185
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,760
to change how your taste buds

1186
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,079
react to it and i think the most common

1187
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,200
misconception is

1188
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,760
reds should also be chilled slightly and

1189
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,520
the way to achieve that is throw your

1190
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,040
bread in the fridge

1191
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,200
and then about 10 to 15 minutes before

1192
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,319
you take it out

1193
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,560
i mean take it out in advance and so it

1194
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,319
just comes down to

1195
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,040
closer to room temperature than uh just

1196
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,240
what's there

1197
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,400
slightly a little bit chilled with the

1198
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,599
red you're going to want to let it sit

1199
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:25,839
for a little bit let it breathe

1200
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,040
i think pour it into whatever can hold

1201
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,640
it and drink it it's it's all going to

1202
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,599
work out so

1203
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,599
these are officially the ways to select

1204
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,839
your uh glassware but don't worry too

1205
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,040
much about it none of these are hard

1206
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,319
rules

1207
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,119
uh so again drink what you like anything

1208
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,240
over ten bottles

1209
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,400
it's gonna be i mean over ten dollars

1210
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,520
anything over ten bottles

1211
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,200
you'll be you'll be more than okay

1212
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,880
anything over ten dollars a bottle

1213
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,599
you're gonna be good um boxed wine

1214
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,480
actually can be

1215
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,000
pretty good so the stereotype of box

1216
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,760
wine as we think of like the two buck

1217
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,240
chuck or like frangia yeah those are not

1218
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,200
great wines

1219
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,800
but there has actually been a lot of

1220
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,560
work over the last about decade and a

1221
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,440
half of some pretty good wines

1222
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,359
that come in boxes and the advantage

1223
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,920
there is we don't have to wrestle with

1224
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,680
the wine going bad

1225
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,880
wine oxidizes as it's open so

1226
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,240
it's not the kind of thing you can leave

1227
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
open overnight box wine

1228
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,119
solves some of that um easy way to think

1229
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,319
about pairing

1230
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,280
red goes with anything red white with

1231
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,119
pretty much everything else

1232
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,400
and then one of the other tricks that

1233
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
i've personally used is i

1234
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,920
save the cork tops from my whiskey

1235
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,880
bottles

1236
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,280
and i have found that just by creating a

1237
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,400
collection of them

1238
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,000
i'm always going to have one that will

1239
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,319
just easily

1240
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,839
stop her a bottle of wine

1241
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,480
so with wine it's about the story

1242
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,480
so the wine we're drinking today is

1243
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,240
apostle robles

1244
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,319
the story behind this particular one so

1245
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,079
paso robles is

1246
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,119
um actually in california

1247
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,800
but uh this blend here was inspired by

1248
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,480
the delightful wines from the south of

1249
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,920
france and spain

1250
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,520
a combination of well-known varieties

1251
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,280
from the old world so

1252
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,560
on one hand you could say all right

1253
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,640
that's that's a bit much but that story

1254
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,319
kind of ties into what we're making here

1255
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,240
this is a traditionally french dish

1256
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,839
there's a little bit of a story to this

1257
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,760
it can be a little fun

1258
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,880
and then of course the stories

1259
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,040
you make with the one again i look

1260
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,200
forward to post pandemic world where we

1261
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,960
can sit around with a bottle

1262
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,640
and learn from each other

1263
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,560
so i paired my coco van

1264
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,599
with a parsnip bash i picked parsnips

1265
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,440
uh just to introduce something a little

1266
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
bit different it's a root vegetable

1267
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,440
just have to peel it dice it again i

1268
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,040
don't have to be too particular

1269
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,079
um dice it roughly boil it

1270
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,319
drain it and then just like baking

1271
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:01,440
mashed potatoes

1272
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,480
add what you want so this case

1273
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,560
all i did was butter salt and pepper i

1274
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,480
didn't add anything else because

1275
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,160
the juices that have been working here

1276
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,000
for hours are going to provide

1277
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,160
most of the flavor and the parsnip is

1278
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,760
just

1279
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,280
something there that's going to catch

1280
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,680
all of it

1281
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,920
i've been uh doing my own cooking show

1282
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,680
for about a year i've had a number of

1283
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,960
guests on

1284
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,520
our goals are make the kitchen

1285
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,480
accessible

1286
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,160
so it's easier for everybody else to

1287
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,319
cook raise money for good causes

1288
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,680
and have fun while we're doing it where

1289
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,760
every wednesday we try to publish the

1290
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,599
recipes about a week in advance

1291
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,960
each guest chef picks their own recipe

1292
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,440
so feel free to join us and for those

1293
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,880
who are interested in coming on the show

1294
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,440
shoot me a note

1295
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:54,400
alright so let's put it all together

1296
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,480
first i'm going to start with some

1297
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,079
parsnip mesh

1298
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,040
this could be our base

1299
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,839
then

1300
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:23,839
oh that's awesome

1301
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:37,599
all right

1302
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:38,720
so one of the things i like about

1303
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,960
cooking is you can taste and adjust as

1304
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,760
you go

1305
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,400
so before you serve you can always go

1306
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,079
light on the salt because you can add

1307
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,520
more salt

1308
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,280
but it's kind of hard to take it away um

1309
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,880
there we go make sure we get some more

1310
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,599
all right and then we're going to dress

1311
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,160
ours up so i kept some of the fronds

1312
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,319
from the top of the fennel just see that

1313
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,599
there we're going to just

1314
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,880
dress that up over it

1315
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,480
and voila

1316
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,280
chicken coco

1317
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,040
and i managed to do all that with uh

1318
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,720
four minutes to spare although to be

1319
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,319
fair i did start five minutes early

1320
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,200
so uh i'm happy to take questions i will

1321
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,079
be in the slack

1322
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,440
for a little bit afterward to answer

1323
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,920
questions and again i will share all of

1324
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,160
my slides so all the resources including

1325

00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,760
freezing

1344
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,160
um

1345
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,280
will you have a place where you also add

1346
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,240
um

1347
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,760
handouts as well uh following this

1348
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,520
not just like the powerpoint um handouts

1349
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,240
yeah i don't what do you mean by

1350
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:46,880
handouts

1351
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,560
i guess they mean like pdfs or something

1352
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,319
they could follow along with

1353
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,880
uh i mean the powerpoint will be i'll

1354
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,480
put it on slideshare so i mean to be

1355
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,440
able to access it

1356
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,640
through you know the website

1357
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,400
perfect um in your opinion

1358
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,520
uh do you think sysmon is necessarily

1359
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,160
easy for everyone or is there some work

1360
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:08,800
uh

1361
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,480
that needs to be done to tune it for

1362
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,040
each org

1363
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,160
so yeah uh sysmon is easy to install

1364
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,079
sysmont is easy to configure

1365
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,400
uh sysmon is gonna be generating uh this

1366
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,680
is where i was talking about about the

1367
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,839
challenge with data storage and

1368
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,559
retention uh

1369
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,800
based on how you tune it you can

1370
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,240
overwhelm yourself with

1371
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,359
too much data so uh tuning it to what

1372
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,559
matters to you versus

1373
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,760
like for example um uh the last time i

1374
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,280
was looking at the sysmon configs

1375
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,480
between

1376
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,680
swift and olaf swift

1377
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,119
was not capturing like lsas

1378
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,680
and that's an example of okay you know

1379
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,200
what that's something where that's a

1380
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,280
common process on an operating system

1381
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,400
that's getting invoked so it can

1382
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,599
generate a lot of data

1383
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,599
on the other hand that leaves you open

1384
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:56,880
to the fact that

1385
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,119
that could be used as a low-bass

1386
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,839
injection point

1387
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,040
excellent thanks um and then you

1388
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,200
mentioned using that on user hosts

1389
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,200
is sending logs to a centralized host

1390
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,319
something that can be achieved with

1391
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:13,520
everyone working from home

1392
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,480
or and also what ways could that be done

1393
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:16,880
yeah

1394
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,920
so um you can have inf so

1395
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,079
the challenge usually with uh more of a

1396
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,200
remote workforce

1397
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,240
is that uh that host is not always on

1398
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,400
and so you can have it where it's stored

1399
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,760
locally and then it's forwarded when

1400
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,359
that connection is there

1401
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,160
um but i mean other than that it's a

1402
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,920
corporate asset that's going to be

1403
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,920
vpninting in just like any other asset i

1404
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,680
mean the difference is just that vpn

1405
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,359
versus it being

1406
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,160
locally present

1407
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,240
and lastly lastly

1408
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,880
what is your ratio of wine to chicken

1409
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,890
stock

1410
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,079
[Laughter]

1411
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,119
um great question so uh the thing about

1412
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,240
cooking and you'll notice this when i

1413
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,599
publish the recipe is

1414
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,319
i'm not a fan of giving like real

1415
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,440
particular amounts because i really

1416
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,319
think each chef

1417
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,800
kind of wants to sha-tune to you know

1418
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,160
tune it to themselves

1419
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,280
um but i i aim for

1420
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,680
about a cup of wine to about two to

1421
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,440
three cups of chicken stock is how i did

1422
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,079
this

1423
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,119
um uh you you want enough

1424
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,480
where you are cooking and adding flavor

1425
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,160
um it helps to keep the chicken on top

1426
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,079
there so you can still benefit from

1427
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,280
the skin staying a little crispy and

1428
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,559
uh uh the the harder part really is

1429
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,319
figuring out the right amount of flour

1430
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,400
to thicken the sauce to the the right

1431
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,079
level and that's just something where

1432
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,760
add a little bit add a little bit add a

1433
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,880
little bit and you want to do that

1434
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,839
anyway otherwise your flour is going to

1435
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,119
clump

1436
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,520
wonderful thank you so much this was

1437
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,480
amazing

1438
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,319
i know i'm starving there's some more

1439
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,920
questions in the chat so i'll let you

1440
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,640
answer those

1441
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,400
for example can you store snacks in your

1442
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,400
beard but save it for the chat

1443
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,680
and we will see you there

1444
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,520
thanks bryson see on slack
