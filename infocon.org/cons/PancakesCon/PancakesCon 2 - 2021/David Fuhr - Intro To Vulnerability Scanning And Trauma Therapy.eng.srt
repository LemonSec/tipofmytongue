talking to us

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,040
about vulnerability analysis and trauma

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,000
therapy two very important topics david

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,599

i hope you can see them okay so this is

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,160
a pancake

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,120
yes according to berliners this is a

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,640
pancake

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
according to everybody else in germany

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,719
was to be taken seriously at least this

23
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,960
is a berliner

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,079
so almost six years ago

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,040
the proudest boasts was ichiban iron

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,439
berliner i am a pancake

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,000
today in the world of covet and online

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,280
connectedness

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,320
the proudest boss is i am at pancakes

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:14,960
con

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,640
talking to you live from berlin

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
through a reshuffle of the of the of the

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,400
program i got some heavy competition

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,439
if i were you i might actually

35
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,680
go and watch lodrina cherny talk about

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,159
forensics data and world championship

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,640
uh if my google skills didn't fail me

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,360
she's uh

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,000
she's an sc magazine a woman in cyber

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,280
security to watch of the year 2019 and

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,479
unlike me she's a true world champion

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,360
so you should really uh go and check out

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,240
her talk

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,640
either now or maybe when when the

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,840
recordings are there

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,520
okay so what i

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,759
brought you today is two topics that are

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,759
close to my heart both of them

49
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,320
um i changed the title a little bit

50
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,840
before it was vulnerability

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
analysis now it's vulnerability

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,880
management

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,360
we'll get to why that that distinction

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,560
is important

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,040
and i'll be talking to you both about

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,959
vulnerability scanning

57
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,879
in security and trauma therapy

58
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,440
especially gestalt therapy

59
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,879
so why am i doing this so i like to

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,360
spend

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,040
my time focus my my attention

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,920
to to borders to to boundaries between

63
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,120
different topics

64
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,959
so i come from a tech background i

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,239
started with software

66
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,440
when i was nine years old i have a mass

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,959
degree

68
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,680
and i'm a trained gestalt therapist and

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,200
organizational consultant

70
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,480
so i always try to bring these different

71
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,160
topics together

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,200
and you always find interesting mixes in

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,840
between

74
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,720
like security automation is where math

75
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,120
can

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,879
can help you to do better to get better

77
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,319
at tech or

78
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,040
math and psychology is when you try to

79
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,920
teach me

80
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,120
machines how to think and the

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,159
traditional

82
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,080
link between tech and psychology is

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,159
social engineering

84
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,360
also very very exciting topic

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
but uh when when the when the when the

86
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,280
call for

87
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,000
for for talks for for pancakes was up i

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,680
had the idea there's another thing

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,560
that's both

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,080
in tech and in thinking about the human

91
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,720
soul

92
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,040
and that's vulnerabilities and hence my

93
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,280
talk

94
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,920
behind every pancake there's a strong

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,680
team this is my colleagues

96
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,560
as we speak now that was uh that was the

97
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,519
other night

98
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,760
uh working on the on the hafnium

99
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,120
incident response

100
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,360
near germany so hi everybody

101
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,519
okay so what's the vulnerability well

102
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,360
there's different definitions

103
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,120
uh i chose a uh um especially beautiful

104
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,560
one um

105
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,480
this is from from a standard this is

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,080
this uh which is otherwise

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,360
rather useless the iso 270

108
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,480
32 but it has this nice graphic uh

109
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,879
and it shows the vulnerability in the

110
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,560
middle right in the center

111
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,600
of what it what security is about

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
so it's really one thing that you want

113
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,560
to consider when thinking about security

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
uh and in different ways so you have

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,960
stakeholders who need to

116
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,840
know what their valuable assets are they

117
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,320
need to

118
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,840
evaluate their assets you have risks

119
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,440
stemming from inside or out outside a

120
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,759
threat agents

121
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,360
who pose threats to your assets

122
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,320
and when when do they do this when

123
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,240
there's a vulnerability

124
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,759
in your assets that threatens to reduce

125
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,600
the value of your assets

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,479
that you're not controlling uh well

127
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,479
enough

128
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,320
okay maybe a little bit confusing we'll

129
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,800
we'll get it on an easier level

130
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,080
but this is in at the heart

131
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,440
what every what every security program

132
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,840
tries to achieve all these different get

133
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,120
all these different arrows and

134
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,280
relationships right

135
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,720
okay so what

136
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,960
what do we do when we do vulnerability

137
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,320
management

138
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,800
here's one of those typical management

139
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,360
system

140
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,440
circles so there's different steps that

141
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,120
you that you're doing

142
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,680
uh in a defined order and there's a lot

143
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,240
of

144
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,479
tasks that you have to do so you need

145
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,560
some some kind of system that

146
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,160
reminds you or the people responsible uh

147
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,039
when when what needs to be done by by

148
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,240
whom

149
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,560
today we're only going to look at a

150
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,680
small part of this

151
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,360
a little bit of the pre-work so the

152
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,039
scoping

153
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,039
and then especially the part about

154
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,199
assessing vulnerabilities

155
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,479
and there's you see the uh the scanning

156
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,639
as one central element vulnerability

157
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,400
scanning of one

158
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,520
um of one tool that can use to assess

159
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,319
vulnerabilities in your or your clients

160
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,720
assets

161
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,440
okay so what's what's this scanning

162
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
thing well you can buy

163
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
or rent different kind of kinds of

164
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,360
scanners some are

165
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,520
better known some are some some some are

166
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
more niche products

167
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,080
so here's a yeah here's some examples

168
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,240
it's not another complete list by any

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,960
means there's

170
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,360
nessus by channel that's quite well

171
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,080
known

172
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,240
uh and there's different other vendors

173
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,560
koalas rapid seven trustwave

174
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,319
there's even an um a free one open

175
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,800
source one openvas

176
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,080
um and there's there's lots more um

177
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,240
i'm going to use nasa's as an example

178
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,120
today

179
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,599
uh not because i'm endorsing them but

180
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,160
it's the

181
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,639
the the scanner that i've been using the

182
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,199
most

183
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,880
in in my career so um yeah for me it's

184
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,360
easiest to talk about nesses

185
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
but you could use um any of these

186
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,080
products actually

187
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,960
so what what what what does a scanner do

188
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,280
okay i try to find a

189
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,639
a metaphor for this so

190
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,800
imagine somebody built a sandcastle or

191
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,960
you build a sand castle somewhere on on

192
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,680
the beach

193
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,160
yeah or maybe different people build

194
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,319
sand castles

195
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,120
spread out across the beach and then

196
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,319
somebody comes

197
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,520
a kid or any anybody and

198
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,919
and starts throwing things at these sand

199
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,199
castles

200
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,880
uh random things so what would they

201
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,759
throw they would throw air they would

202
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,240
throw

203
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,000
a hair they would throw a hydrogen

204
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,440
atom an oxygen atom that would through

205
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,680
throw lots and lots and lots of things

206
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,199
and most of those things

207
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,240
wouldn't hurt the castle but eventually

208
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,319
they they're really clueless what what

209
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,919
what they what they should throw though

210
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,800
so they just try everything they can

211
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,080
they can find

212
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,919
eventually they they they try a stone

213
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,280
and the stone um manages to to to

214
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,240
destroy

215
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,639
a little bit of that sand castle and

216
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,840
then they learned

217
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,000
something about that sand castle oops

218
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,520
this sand castle is vulnerable to stones

219
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,280
well now you can say well they they

220
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,039
should have known before

221
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,759
but they they could have but uh

222
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,000
vulnerability scanning is really

223
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,639
uh being stupid about what might work

224
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,159
and what what what wouldn't

225
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,958
um and you throw lots and lots and lots

226
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,360
of

227
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,958
things 99.9

228
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,279
of them were useless and ridiculous that

229
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,200
somebody would even try this

230
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,399
uh at a at a number of targets

231
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,120
and just take note what happens nothing

232
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,519
nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing

233
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,640
oops

234
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,440
so what do you get out a long list of

235
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,320
nothings

236
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,120
and a few oopses and of course the oops

237
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,240
is

238
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,320
your your vons and that's what you're

239
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,720
interested about

240
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,240
okay so a modern vulnerability scanner

241
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,760
can can cover tens of thousands of cves

242
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,200
so known vulnerabilities um

243
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,279
they they can have uh more than a

244
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,480
hundred thousands of

245
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,560
plugins or whatever they call them so

246
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,600
that's uh

247
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,240
that's little descriptions of what you

248
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,640
could

249
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,640
try throwing what object in what way

250
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,760
and what reaction you would expect

251
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,040
and how to interpret uh if you don't get

252
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,880
a reaction a but reaction b

253
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,839
back so that's like your little little

254
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,720
tests and you want

255
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,360
lots of them the more the better uh

256
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,800
because it gets you more

257
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,240
coverage in in breath what what uh

258
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
what works and what doesn't on a given

259
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,440
target

260
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,880
and of course you want that uh uh um

261
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,680
current so they should uh update these

262
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,839
these plugins so it could be new ones

263
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,720
uh as often as possible because uh

264
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,440
there's

265
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,320
new new new products new software new

266
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,600
new applications

267
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,160
uh a new vulnerability is discovered

268
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,640
every

269
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,600
every every day worldwide so you want

270
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,399
your scanner

271
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,519
to to to try and recognize these new

272
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,320
valves as well

273
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,880
so the inside of a scanner can look

274
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
something like this this is this is a

275
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,640
version of nessus for example

276
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,800
so basically there's there's there's not

277
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,079
so many things in here

278
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,079
on the left hand side you see you have

279
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,160
your scans

280
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,480
and then you have customizations like

281
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,600
policies

282
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,200
rules reports and and so on

283
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
and for the for the for the scans you

284
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,320
can have different types

285
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,560
depending on what you want to want to

286
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,079
scan what kind of

287
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,519
what kind of assets and also what you

288
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,399
want

289
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,959
from your report what it is for is it a

290
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,720
compliance report

291
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
possibly then you and it needs to have a

292
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,839
certain form

293
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,399
or it needs or it needs to cover certain

294
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:06,959
certain

295
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,360
things certain tests or should you be

296
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,160
more aggressive

297
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,040
less aggressive do you want to tweak it

298
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,200
to the last detail or you want to try

299
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,320
something standard

300
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,880
out of the box so there's a lot of

301
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,560
templates you can choose from julie

302
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,760
usually and in my experience you you end

303
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,200
up having your favorite

304
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,120
uh handful that you that you're using

305
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,680
for for most projects

306
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,120
okay so when you when you when you want

307
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,320
to do a scan

308
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,480
um the most important thing you have to

309
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,560
fill out or import

310
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,160
uh from a file is your targets so this

311
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,240
is the scoping so the scanner needs to

312
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,959
know

313
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,000
uh where to throw these

314
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,200
uh where to throw all these things uh

315
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
what what what objects what assets to

316
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,399
tests

317
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,120
so in here in this field you will put a

318
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,160
range of ip

319
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,440
addresses or one ip address or or a

320
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,880
domain name

321
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,120
and here you really need to be careful

322
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,320
to to enter

323
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,639
the correct ones because you do not want

324
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,360
to test

325
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,160
somebody else's somebody else's assets

326
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,120
where you didn't get

327
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,680
um where did you get permission to do so

328
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,880
yeah so this is one

329
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,600
one thing where you need to when you're

330
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,040
a consultant for example

331
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,839
uh to have an agreement with your with

332
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:24,959
your client

333
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,760
better get it in written in some form

334
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,399
okay

335
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,920
these ip ranges arranges are are cleared

336
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,480
to be

337
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,360
to be to be scanned um and you need to

338
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,320
make sure the right

339
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,639
the right numbers and symbols go in here

340
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,240
and you don't you don't mix it

341
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,560
you don't mix it up on the way okay

342
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,639
other than that there's a there's a

343
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,639
number of configurations that you can

344
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,160
that you can do

345
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,000
um i will just uh talk about very few

346
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,480
because this could be another talk of

347
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,000
three four or five hours

348
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,800
um credentials so you can give

349
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,440
credentials to a scanner and this might

350
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,279
feel a little bit strange for

351
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,920
for security-minded people usually you

352
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,519
don't want to give

353
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,200
uh hacker tools credentials because

354
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,120
they should find those credentials for

355
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,279
you or break them or brute force them or

356
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,720
whatever

357
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,880
but here i think they're thinking is the

358
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,040
other way around so the scanner is

359
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,399
your friend so they want to get as much

360
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,279
information

361
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,480
as as possible from those

362
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,720
hundreds and thousands of of throwings

363
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,839
that they do

364
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,040
so you better help them do it and

365
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,079
if you can enter credentials for for the

366
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,920
machines you're scanning be it windows

367
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,600
obvious ssh

368
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,920
and the linux unix world you make it

369
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,720
easier

370
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,240
for a scanner to to place it to throw

371
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,440
its tests

372
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,839
so once you have an account on the

373
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,839
machine and the scanner can use it

374
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,880
it's much easier it's faster and also

375
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,079
they can use more

376
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,079
of the plugins more of these tests so

377
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,199
you get better data so you want this

378
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,639
uh it's good practice not to use uh

379
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,680
an account that has um a privilege to to

380
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,399
to write

381
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,079
important things so if you can have

382
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,160
something like

383
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,279
an unprivileged account either read only

384
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,880
depending on the use case

385
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,920
or um just something that is just enough

386
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,000
to get out the information that you need

387
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,279
but cannot or alter your system or just

388
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,959
destroy the configuration

389
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,000
uh the better this is what you want

390
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,279
okay so what do you get out in the end

391
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,399
um a list basically a long list well

392
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,000
depending on your target

393
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,920
could be short but in typical cases

394
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,040
you get long long long lists of

395
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,199
vulnerabilities

396
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,240
and these lines are volumes uh

397
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,519
every line is wrong it's structured data

398
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,480
so you have

399
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,959
different fields like the severity

400
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:01,519
that's

401
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,760
for the most important one uh this is

402
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,639
the ranking

403
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,839
that the scanner has well not hard coded

404
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,880
but it's in

405
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,360
the scanner's database so the scanner

406
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,079
knows nothing

407
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,639
about your application nothing about

408
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,639
what's in there what kind of data

409
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,920
how critical is the application

410
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,199
per se what it knows is uh in a typical

411
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,880
application

412
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,639
a von like this uh could be critical

413
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,800
for typical use cases something like

414
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,959
that yeah so this is where the rating

415
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,040
comes from and then you have counts and

416
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,199
you have uh cross references where was

417
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,839
it found how often in what assets and so

418
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,120
on and so on

419
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,759
and these lists can be really long so

420
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,920
you need some kind of um

421
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,880
um summaries and uh and one is here on

422
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,000
the right hand side

423
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,399
you just count how many critical high

424
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,040
medium low info bonds were found so

425
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,759
these kind of

426
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,959
dashboard like things and this is a

427
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,279
report they call this a report

428
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,519
but oftentimes this is not what you want

429
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,959
to give your customers

430
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,160
so if you just throw them

431
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,360
throw give them a list of 250

432
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
vulnerabilities of different of

433
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,040
different severities

434
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,839
they will not do they will not know most

435
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,279
most customers will not

436
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,079
know what to do with it so usually it's

437
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:22,880
a good idea

438
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,160
to process it even more to to get

439
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,279
for example to the root cause if there's

440
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,120
100 100 volumes that all go back to

441
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
uh the organization not patching

442
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,160
correctly

443
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,639
then this is the real find i mean you

444
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,160
should you should uh

445
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,639
put the all the data what was found in

446
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,399
the appendix for sure

447
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,440
but uh for them the

448
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,759
the operationalized data is more is more

449
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,759
important so what steps do they need to

450
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,639
take

451
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,320
to make uh this long list get shorter

452
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
uh especially in the in the red and the

453
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,079
red areas

454
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,519
okay and if you want to

455
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,959
dive into one of these bonds or report

456
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,919
report lines then you can see exactly

457
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,520
what the scanner did

458
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,400
um so it tried this and that got that

459
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,119
and that

460
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,919
result back that's why it was reported

461
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,760
uh it happened on part x

462
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,799
and host y um and uh

463
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,280
so better scanners even give you uh

464
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,119
advice how to fix

465
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,400
uh how to fix this thing for for

466
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,480
at least for for for a large number of

467
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,440
vulnerabilities

468
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,000
uh one last thing maybe uh for the

469
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
configuration

470
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,320
so you um there's there's basically two

471
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,280
use cases

472
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,520
for for a scanner to use either you can

473
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,960
use it just to scan

474
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,000
one host or one application one ip one

475
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,880
domain

476
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,600
um and then you know what your asset is

477
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,400
and then

478
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,240
you basically um decide um

479
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,320
how hard you want to go so there's

480
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,240
aggressive more aggressive and less

481
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,760
aggressive settings

482
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,080
uh so for example if this is uh

483
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,520
something something

484
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,960
in industrial security um you might want

485
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,080
to be more careful

486
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,039
and and not um not throw all the tests

487
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:17,600
to

488
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,679
um uh to an asset because uh you have to

489
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,280
you have to think about what might go

490
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,400
wrong um on the other hand if this is a

491
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,799
web application that is uh on the

492
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,320
internet on on the world wide web

493
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,600
anyways

494
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,880
and and anybody can just try anything uh

495
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,559
then it shouldn't and it shouldn't

496
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,039
crumble when when somebody

497
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,520
comes and and says nasa's aggressive so

498
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,919
you and and if it and if it fails

499
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,799
uh then you want to know right so uh

500
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,320
this is the aggressiveness

501
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,160
but then there's also when you have a

502
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,760
big big network

503
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,200
to to scan so in um in internal audits

504
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,600
um

505
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,000
or when you're as a consultant you uh

506
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,919
you you're you're called to do an

507
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,440
internal network audit you might run uh

508
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,480
nessus or or another scanner across a

509
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,200
whole

510
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,559
um subnet

511
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,440
b class c class yeah so there's lots of

512
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,720
assets and you don't

513
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,679
know in advance how many there will be

514
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,880
and then what ips

515
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,960
because maybe the organization doesn't

516
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,640
have our

517
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,799
current current data that they can

518
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,160
really rely on

519
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,080
so part of you part of your assignment

520
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,000
is to find out what they what they have

521
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,799
what assets are are there what's online

522
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,440
um

523
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,559
and then you need to think about

524
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,840
discovery because

525
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,039
uh if you try and throw these 150

526
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,960
000 plugins at every port

527
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,480
and every ip uh that that there is in

528
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,440
the subnet

529
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,919
you wouldn't get finished so there's

530
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,840
some smart sources choices the the

531
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,799
scanner makes

532
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,919
so it doesn't make sense to to throw ftp

533
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:58,400
tests

534
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,120
say at ports that are never used by by

535
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,000
ftp

536
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,559
uh and there's a lot of these of these

537
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,440
of these uh

538
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,880
things um but you also have to

539
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,240
uh think about how can i can i find out

540
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,400
uh where there is active hosts and

541
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,000
active ports at all

542
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,880
um so this would be another talk how you

543
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,000
do this

544
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,559
efficiently and reliably so this is this

545
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,360
is about

546
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,039
port scanning but the the vulnerability

547
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,320
scanners have built-in

548
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,039
port scanners um and there you can

549
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,120
try to hit a sweet spot between

550
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,480
efficiency so you

551
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,760
do you don't want to try everything

552
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,360
everywhere because that's going to take

553
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,520
forever but you don't want to miss a

554
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,400
host

555
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,240
just because you tried ports 443

556
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,280
80 and uh 23 and it

557
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,400
and it didn't answer so um this is

558
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,960
uh a little bit some something you have

559
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,760
to get a

560
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,600
feeling for what makes sense and it

561
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,280
definitely depends on the

562
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,159
um on the on the on the network you're

563
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,640
testing

564
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,240
okay yeah i think i said this so there's

565
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,039
uh

566
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,440
different levels of aggressiveness also

567
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,039
in the in the port scanning but

568
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,480
especially in the

569
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,080
in the in the advanced scanning so in

570
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
the in the plug-ins

571
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,679
um okay

572
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,520
one last thing for for for this topic um

573
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,400
uh one nice little thing that you can do

574
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,320
when you get out these long long long

575
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,960
lists

576
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,919
say 200 000 400 pounds and you don't

577
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,320
have

578
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,000
any tools any any process

579
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,320
any any any year-long experience how to

580
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,159
how to process this for for for a

581
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:46,960
customer

582
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,760
one nice thing you can do is export the

583
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,480
report

584
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,400
uh as a csv file uh

585
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,159
pull it into microsoft excel or

586
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,280
open open office if you want um and

587
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,840
build

588
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,480
a pivot table now this is something

589
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,320
a lot of people hate seem to hate for me

590
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,559
maybe because i'm a mathematician pivot

591
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,159
table is one of the

592
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,760
loveliest inventions in in the history

593
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,720
of it

594
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,880
so what it basically does it takes a

595
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,000
long long long

596
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,240
list much too long and boring for humans

597
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,200
to read so on the

598
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,120
in the lower left corner that's your

599
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,600
that's our way too long list

600
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,880
um and then it aggregates um

601
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,520
this list dynamically so you can change

602
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,640
the the

603
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,440
order and and type of aggregation and

604
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,360
and do sums and averages and means and

605
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,240
and whatnot of things and thereby with

606
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,679
just a couple of clicks

607
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,919
you get your long list of of 400 rounds

608
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,720
to

609
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,840
uh to a really short list depending on

610
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,919
how much your customer needs

611
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,159
so um this is really oops

612
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,159
now my screen is not

613
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,600
okay i'm back okay uh

614
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,840
so you can you can really uh choose what

615
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,720
you want to show them

616
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,559
just the the top valence or the sum

617
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,799
or per year per per ip range per country

618
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,480
uh whatever so um so you can you can

619
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,600
basically build

620
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,799
your your your reports just by

621
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,720
doing a couple of clicks in in an

622
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,520
excellent code

623
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,960
coming to the second topic so this is uh

624
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,039
at this moment this is quite of a quite

625
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,559
of a a jump

626
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,799
or we'll try it anyways so we're still

627
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,880
talking about vulnerabilities this time

628
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,880
in the human soul so as i said i i'm a

629
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,000
trained gestalt

630
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,080
therapist and i'm not going to say

631
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,000
anything unfortunately due to time

632
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,480
constraints about gestalt today

633
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,240
i would love to talk to you about it for

634
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,440
for for half of today and tonight

635
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,799
um i'm just gonna show you a few things

636
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,400
um that were developed in gestalt and

637
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,559
uh and some and some related fields of

638
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,520
psychology

639
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,480
so this is the gestalt wave and it's a

640
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,279
model

641
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,320
that tries to explain how the human

642
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,760
soul works um

643
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,279
and you can do it with an example of

644
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,600
food so when you

645
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,120
when you're hungry uh you you do

646
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,840
you know it's it's not uh on off so what

647
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,960
what really happens is

648
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,360
you have a sensation something something

649
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,919
strange you don't know what it is yet

650
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,039
you have to get aware at first oh i

651
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,880
think i might be hungry

652
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,919
um and then

653
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,200
you need to find something where to

654
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,600
where to point your awareness okay

655
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,640
hungry hungry

656
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,279
ah there was this picture of this of

657
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,000
this berliner pancake that david had in

658
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,440
in his talk and then you uh you have

659
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,720
you have your your target but then

660
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,400
uh you need the next step you need

661
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
mobilization you need to

662
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,440
to to build up enough energy to really

663
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,279
stand up go outside

664
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,720
uh well if you can it's not locked down

665
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,640
um get moving and really buy steel

666
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,799
or or or bake this pancake this berliner

667
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,200
so this is called a contact so you have

668
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,000
to

669
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,520
you have to do it you have to make

670
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
contact with the outside world it takes

671
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,400
the most energy and then you're not done

672
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,760
yet because uh

673
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,360
you still need to eat it you need to

674
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,120
bite it so you need some kind of

675
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,000
aggression

676
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,720
it's a positive positive thing in

677
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,840
english doubt

678
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,360
and then you need to chew and you need

679
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,960
to swallow

680
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,600
and then you need to digest it and then

681
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,960
you're still not done

682
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,240
because it takes a while until this

683
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,400
feeling of hunger now we know it was

684
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,600
hunger

685
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,360
can calm down and your energy

686
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,320
goes to a lower level the wave is over

687
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,039
and there's

688
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,320
space and energy for a new wave and

689
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,840
our life is just um it's just

690
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,080
lots and lots of these waves some are

691
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,320
overlapping some are

692
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,240
some are finished some are not because

693
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,000
at every point in this wave

694
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,240
something can go wrong and i'm saying

695
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,600
this in quotes because

696
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,080
um in gestalt we don't like to think

697
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,440
about

698
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,400
right or wrong this is uh because these

699
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,799
are

700
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,760
these are powerful concepts um that that

701
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,559
have a

702
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,200
they can have a very uh a negative

703
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,760
effect

704
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,600
on on people so uh what we we try to

705
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,720
say things like in every step of this

706
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,159
of this wave something can go

707
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,760
with uh can can go with too much energy

708
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,480
or

709
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,600
or too little energy too

710
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,320
much too little like compared to the

711
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,120
normal

712
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,760
uh and it's all good yeah you get

713
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,039
through the curve

714
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,480
but you might not be fully satisfied in

715
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,039
the end

716
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,159
or you might not be calm in the end just

717
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,440
one example you don't find out uh

718
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,960
that that it is a pancake that you want

719
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,080
although i showed it to you but you

720
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,440
forgot or you didn't you didn't you

721
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,640
didn't see my talk

722
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,120
uh and then you just go outside and you

723
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,480
grab the first thing that

724
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,799
the that that crosses you and that's an

725
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,399
apple and you bite that apple and you

726
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,679
think

727
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,480
okay it's nice yeah will get me

728
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,440
satisfied

729
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,640
you chew you swallow

730
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,880
and then you're still sitting there

731
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,399
something is not right something is not

732
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,039
right

733
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,919
and it's okay you didn't starve but the

734
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:46,880
problem is

735
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,039
this takes up a little bit of your

736
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,320
energy

737
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,279
and now remember we said there's

738
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,440
hundreds thousands

739
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,600
millions of these waves throughout your

740
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,880
lives

741
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,000
and anytime a wave doesn't run through

742
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,039
smoothly a little bit of your energy

743
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,000
can be caught in it and this is what

744
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,600
happens necessarily

745
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,480
life doesn't run smooth um and gestalt

746
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,279
is a way of thinking about these things

747
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,720
um thinking about theories

748
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,760
also but but but more about about

749
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,200
practices how to how to get this running

750
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,320
smoother how to how to close

751
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,840
uh close

752
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,520
where the name comes from okay

753
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,159
because okay i should move my

754
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,840
window so i can see see

755
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,159
see this beautiful slide that i found in

756
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,440
the preparation for this talk i didn't

757
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,200
know it i didn't know it before

758
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,679
by nick by nick um because

759
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,520
what's happened what happens is not only

760
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,440
that these waves are

761
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,640
feeding us and allowing us to live

762
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,640
it's it's basically the definition of

763
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,039
life right um

764
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,600
but the very process of going through

765
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,120
these waves defines

766
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,159
ourselves so according to gestalt

767
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,130
there is no self

768
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,799
[Music]

769
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,600
apart from contact contact with the

770
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,799
outer world

771
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,440
and the inner world so hunger is contact

772
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,080
with our

773
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,760
with our own body and the the pancake or

774
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,760
the apple is contact contact with the

775
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,159
with the outer world

776
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,520
so we go in these circles and we we have

777
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,799
contacts

778
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,960
that are realized that that do that

779
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,840
happen

780
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,120
and contexts that um are avoided for

781
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,480
example that we that we

782
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,640
avoid by different mechanisms and

783
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,679
there's there's a ton of these

784
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,640
mechanisms

785
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,919
for example desensitization so i don't i

786
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:54,720
just don't

787
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,799
feel i'm hungry i will be running one

788
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,080
example yeah

789
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,520
blame would be another one okay i

790
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,760
only think about somebody else is

791
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,679
somebody else's fault i don't think

792
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,960
about myself

793
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,240
at all uh all the opposite i

794
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,480
i don't even get to thinking about

795
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,440
anybody else

796
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,679
it's just me it's just my fault this

797
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,279
would be called retroflexion

798
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,320
for example but um

799
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,200
what's hap what happens is these these

800
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,399
these boundaries

801
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,000
between the in inner and and outer world

802
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,480
and what happens at those boundaries the

803
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,080
name is contact

804
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,880
this is what defines us uh in the in the

805
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,159
gestalt model

806
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,440
so uh this is this is really where we

807
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,720
where we live in in the

808
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,440
in the true sense of the of of the world

809
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,559
so it's not

810
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,840
how we live but this is what we are

811
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,639
how we how we deal with our boundaries

812
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,519
and now different things can can go

813
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,159
wrong

814
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,000
i'm going to go back one slide

815
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,600
um so um we had this example with the

816
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,440
with it with the apple so that was uh

817
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,200
well it was contrived but

818
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,000
what what usually happens is that we get

819
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,720
that we get

820
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,720
um into patterns somewhere

821
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,559
so well let's talk about

822
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,720
what whatever

823
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,279
somebody uh has this feeling of okay

824
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,000
there is some something i should get

825
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,799
moving

826
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,120
i need something i don't know yet what

827
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,919
it is

828
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,120
um and there is awareness okay

829
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,080
i know um okay i know what it is i want

830
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,480
to do a talk i want to do a public talk

831
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,519
uh and i even get uh

832
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,799
moving so i i bring up the energy um

833
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,919
i i want to talk at pancakes con so i

834
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:00,960
fill out the form

835
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,559
i have i have an idea and then i get

836
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,519
uh into action and and send send the

837
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,799
form

838
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,000
and when it comes to the contact phase

839
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,120
um then maybe in my past uh

840
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,440
i have learned that it's a dangerous

841
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
thing to make that contact

842
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,399
to to do this aggression maybe i got

843
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,559
punished in another phase in my life

844
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,720
for trying too much maybe maybe it

845
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,799
wasn't well well received in my in my

846
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,679
family

847
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,559
that i was that was courageous for

848
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,039
example

849
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,519
i wanted to try a new thing and then i

850
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,360
might have learned

851
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,519
that this is not a good idea then i

852
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,880
might

853
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,200
then i might retract my talk that even

854
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,240
got accepted

855
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,519
and not do it because this is

856
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,720
right now the way i learned it um and i

857
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,279
feel

858
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,039
safer doing it that way and

859
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,519
this is okay and we'll get to this this

860
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,240
is this is

861
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,600
okay this has served that somebody well

862
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,720
um we also get to this um

863
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,919
but what it does not serve for

864
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,960
is getting through this curve fully

865
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,559
and so that person might not find out

866
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,600
um what what it feels like to get to the

867
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,720
end of that

868
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,760
kind of curve and we all do this in one

869
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,600
way all the another

870
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,799
most most of the time in several ways so

871
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,000
we don't have these

872
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,279
curves but we have waves that are have

873
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,440
waves in between and we get stuck

874
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,000
and we retry and we run circles and this

875
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,799
is all

876
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,080
this is all normal when the and when the

877
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,279
when the the patterns um are very

878
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,760
very strong so we really get caught by

879
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,480
it again

880
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,440
and again and again and the old term for

881
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,080
that is

882
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,679
neurosis so uh gestalt doesn't use that

883
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,399
term because

884
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,880
again it's like a a box and we we don't

885
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,640
like to put people in boxes

886
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,279
but um if you want to use that old

887
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,519
language then

888
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,799
is is is is a

889
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,480
it's a way tries tries to get these old

890
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,320
neuroses these these patterns uh

891
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,960
moving and then you don't even know what

892
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,639
comes next that's that's the point

893
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,079
because you haven't because you haven't

894
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:20,879
tried

895
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,679
uh usually for good reasons um and

896
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,679
sometimes sometimes people get to

897
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,839
to a point in their life uh where they

898
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,359
feel

899
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,560
i don't know i'm stuck now i

900
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,879
would like to try something new okay

901
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,239
back to here um and then there's more

902
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:40,800
extreme

903
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,760
cases and again we don't use boxes here

904
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,960
so i i put that

905
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,560
i put the term trauma on

906
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,679
slide trauma means an injury so

907
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,040
it's an injury of the soul but actually

908
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,760
it's not

909
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,839
it's it's not black or white one or one

910
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,280
one or zero either

911
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,079
so we're all injured we're all

912
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,359
vulnerable and we're

913
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,160
we've all been hurt in life it happens

914
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,359
in life

915
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:12,000
and sometimes the um the injuries are

916
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,359
are so deep like like in dense

917
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,400
indents in this into into this self so

918
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,000
so maybe somebody um disrespected our

919
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,560
border

920
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,160
so strongly um that there is a

921
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,000
there is a scar in here or a deep indent

922
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,760
that that led us to reorganizing

923
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,480
everything

924
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,200
inside in a way that we could still go

925
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,480
on living

926
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,160
and this can be called a trauma and

927
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,320
again we don't have much time so i

928
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,560
cannot i i cannot tell you

929
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,079
much about trauma therapy uh today but

930
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,520
what i want to say is

931
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,800
there is there is there is proven

932
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,359
methods

933
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,200
of of positively working with

934
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,680
with trauma and one one example would be

935
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,119
emdr so that's

936
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,560
eye desensition and reprocessing

937
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,960
not even gonna say much uh how how it

938
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,880
works you can you can easily look

939
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,520
look that up but uh somebody i don't

940
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,520
know who they are here headspace

941
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,960
um they made an um an analogy with

942
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,160
uh with it so i just so i stole this

943
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,280
um and so

944
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,560
before um uh in in the trial

945
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,920
in the traumatized state ptsd

946
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,280
this is one of those uh a diagnosis that

947
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,839
quite a few people carry around um

948
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,760
um the the brain is like a

949
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,400
computer with a virus in this analogy

950
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,200
yeah

951
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,880
it's it's over simplified by by a lot

952
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,680
but for the sake of the argument and to

953
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,280
to to get a link between those two

954
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,160
topics we will

955
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,920
we will go with the uh with the metaphor

956
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,760
and then you do some kind of um

957
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,880
work and here it works with uh it's a

958
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,800
very very guided process

959
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,320
um with bodily functions

960
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,960
with the eyes and with with them with

961
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
the mind and with feelings bringing all

962
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,839
these things together

963
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,560
and what the theory says what it does

964
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,480
and you can even measure this uh

965
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,320
with uh with with with images of brain

966
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,280
activity

967
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,200
uh something in your brain is reordered

968
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,760
uh so things that were separate before

969
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,320
that

970
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,640
needed to be separate because it wasn't

971
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,839
wasn't bearable

972
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,440
to to get them in touch uh can start

973
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,440
um communicating again and

974
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,359
oftentimes this this helps people a

975
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,280
great uh

976
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,119
a great deal and there's a number of of

977
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,880
studies um

978
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,040
and if you're interested in it you you

979
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,000
can look it up

980
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,480
emdr either headspace or many other

981
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,359
sources

982
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,720
um so you can work with this with uh

983
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,879
with

984
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,680
um and um

985
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,280
can is the can is the important uh word

986
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,560
here because um

987
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,240
i tried because uh this was really uh

988
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,760
just a tiny little bit of of gestalt and

989
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,599
i tried to distill for you

990
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,320
like the six seven what do we have here

991
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,720
uh

992
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,520
truths again we don't like that word uh

993
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:29,920
but

994
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,640
like what would i like to to show you

995
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,920
from from gestalt

996
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,359
um not just concerning trauma therapy

997
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,640
but but in general

998
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,000
so and and here's my best of list so

999
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,720
if we if we're living parents they were

1000
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,800
learned for a good reason

1001
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,440
and good needs to be underscored here

1002
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,119
and it's usually to protect

1003
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,400
us because it was protecting us in the

1004
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,520
past

1005
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
and this worked well it doesn't feel

1006
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,200
like this usually but it worked well

1007
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,880
otherwise we wouldn't be here today

1008
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,280
so some people even get to the point

1009
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,040
where they

1010
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,690
learn to

1011
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,240
[Music]

1012
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,520
some respect some like some even love

1013
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,800
their patterns sometimes well it won't

1014
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
always work

1015
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,000
once you realize okay wow you

1016
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,480
strange thing that's that's been

1017
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,599
torturing me for

1018
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,560
for years and decades you were you're

1019
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,560
here for you're here for a reason

1020
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,119
and the reason is you saved my life

1021
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,280
something like that

1022
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,040
and if there's resistance or you don't

1023
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,359
want to talk about you don't want to

1024
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,160
know we don't want

1025
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,280
therapy and so on

1026
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,400
for me to talk about me as well this is

1027
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,480
this is a good thing because it means

1028
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,839
not yet not yet again a protector

1029
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,280
those patterns can and often have

1030
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,520
negative side effects for for our lives

1031
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,560
today

1032
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,680
so um there are good reasons

1033
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,680
why somebody would choose to to face

1034
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,720
them sometimes

1035
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,240
yeah but uh you don't have to now

1036
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,680
or tomorrow or or next year or ever

1037
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,200
and and uh um for myself i found it

1038
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,640
i found it i found it truthful to uh

1039
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,119
to know the soul or self or whatever you

1040
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,319
want to call it

1041
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,200
knows when it's time to deal with thing

1042
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,240
with things

1043
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,599
so the soul is quite a competent thing

1044
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,400
inside

1045
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,640
so we don't we don't need to control it

1046
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,760
too much

1047
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,160
so things will pop up when it's when

1048
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,520
it's time for them

1049
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,880
to pop up and for for us to to deal with

1050
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,000
them

1051
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,440
uh and and when you start going

1052
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,000
going on on a on a journey like this

1053
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,560
then

1054
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,520
usually feeling worse a lot and for a

1055
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,319
while

1056
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,480
and for a longer while is a normal thing

1057
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,400
so this is not a warning this is

1058
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,920
okay uh this is uh this is

1059
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,160
a normal side effect of of getting

1060
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,720
things moving and mixed up and

1061
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,680
stirred up and you probably you might

1062
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,560
have to go

1063
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,960
through there before things can settle

1064
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,200
again in a totally different way

1065
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,359
this is the most surprising thing you

1066
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,280
you don't know before

1067
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,319
uh what will come come out of it

1068
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,480
so this is uh this is really the wonder

1069
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,680
of it so

1070
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,880
you don't need a goal or uh um

1071
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,440
where to go uh because you can't know

1072
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,280
any you kind of know anyways

1073
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,000
it's going to be something completely

1074
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,280
different that i that

1075
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,040
you might not even have thought about

1076
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,560
ever

1077
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,760
and last thing when choosing a therapist

1078
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,400
or therapy

1079
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,240
because i get asked this a lot people

1080
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
get asked this a lot uh

1081
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,480
okay what what what what therapist

1082
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,000
should i choose how do i know

1083
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,680
somebody is is right for me yeah

1084
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,400
easy answer uh once you accept it it's

1085
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,119
easy

1086
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,520
trust your heart and because again you

1087
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,480
you know

1088
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,359
or the other way around try imagining

1089
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,480
you know

1090
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
if it's right or not and see what

1091
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,800
happens

1092
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,680
okay so that's about the end of my talk

1093
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,960
