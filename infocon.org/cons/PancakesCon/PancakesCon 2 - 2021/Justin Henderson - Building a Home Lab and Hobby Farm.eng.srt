2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,040
this

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,160
is the next talk line up in track two

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,000
uh justin henderson will be giving us a

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,920
talk on building a home lab

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,040
as well as building a hobby farm

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,440
so justin it is now in your capable

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,680
hands and we'll uh

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,240
go from there all right thank you very

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,880
much

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,119
so to be clear i i'm starting about

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,720
building a home lab and more more about

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,519
why it matters than about the actual

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,640
how-to

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,280
that being said i be sharing some

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,440
resources and references on what you can

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,960
do to build it out but

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,520
there's a lot of misconception on what a

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,559
home lab is

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,120
for i think we tend to think it's like

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,920
you have to have

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,879
passion for a home lab or you know it's

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,879
only for those elitists those

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,280
you know show and tell and bragging

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,160
rights and

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,399
we'll get into all that so i'll start

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,520
with that and then my

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,280
my second half is going to be on hobby

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
farm which

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,039
i'm literally sitting in a barn right

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,720
now because that's that's my

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,439
office and i'm surrounded by 16 and a

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,720
half acres of land

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,520
tons of animals so when i say hobby farm

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,439
in case you're wondering what that means

36
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,159
i'm not dealing with plants that's cool

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:18,560
too

38
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,680
i love i love planting personally but my

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,560
hobby farm is

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,720
animals and one day i hope to retire and

41
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,400
actually do like a little kids petting

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,680
zoo or something

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,320
so we'll go through you know what what

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,000
could you do to maybe start this

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,040
and join me so

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,720
with that uh my name's justin henderson

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,960
so i've been in infosec for

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,880
i want to say close to 20 years at this

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,520
point i've been doing consulting jobs

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,320
since i was

51
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,360
13. would actually go around do like

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,479
active directory installations what's us

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,320
patch management sorry windows server

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,520
update service

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,079
uh we would do pixie boot workstations

56
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,200
and when i say we it's because i

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
partnered with my brother he's three

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,840
years older

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,240
so we made some pretty decent money back

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,040
then

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,479
i have 61 certifications and i'm drawing

62
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,640
attention to this because

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,640
i don't know if it's about certs and

64
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,120
clearly i like certs i got a lot

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,000
but with 61 certs i got to say most of

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,760
my knowledge and training didn't come

67
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,000
from

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,480
studying for those certs i think they've

69
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,319
helped me get like job interviews and i

70
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,560
think certs are a good thing but

71
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,160
part of this talk is we have to figure

72
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,920
out where to draw the line in the sand

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,319
and

74
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,319
we need to get you some jobs and or

75
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,080
maybe get you some promotions or

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,599
i want to figure out what makes you tick

77
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,440
and what you want and i want to help you

78
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,640
get there

79
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,720
so on that note too you know i love

80
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,080
hobby farms i love

81
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,120
infosec i love the two parallels

82
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,040
i do a lot of open source projects i've

83
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,599
got a github full of stuff and talks and

84
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,480
so anyway that's me i'm also a gse and

85
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,400
you know sans author instructor i own my

86
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,760
own business blah blah blah

87
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,159
let's move on to the cool stuff so

88
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,959
let's start right out of the gate with

89
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:05,519
with this

90
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,800
problem i'm trying to identify why

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,840
why a home lab like why do you need to

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,000
take time out of your busy schedule from

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,480
your

94
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,360
family from all these things that matter

95
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,120
to your hobbies right

96
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,239
to build a home lab is is that even fair

97
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,440
that there's even

98
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,560
a potential for expectation

99
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,280
and i i want to share the flip side of

100
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,720
this for a second

101
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,640
i have interviewed hundreds of

102
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,760
individuals

103
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,319
i own my own company so i've hired folks

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,319
back before i owned my own company i was

105
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,200
a um

106
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,040
a systems and security architect and i

107
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,879
interviewed a lot of people for the team

108
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,799
i was managing and

109
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,200
there's this there's this problem and i

110
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,640
literally just went through this last

111
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,760
week i put a

112
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,599
interview i put a thing out for a new

113
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,840
position with my company

114
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,439
and within one day we had 50 plus

115
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,280
applications and we're starting to call

116
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,400
them and

117
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,480
it's the same old experience that looks

118
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,680
like this

119
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,000
resume looks pretty good you've got you

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,599
know a couple years of experience you've

121
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,239
got

122
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,959
a bachelor's a master sometimes even

123
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,480
phds

124
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,319
you've got at the bottom of the resume

125
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,560
all these different skills

126
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,639
you've got active directory you know how

127
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,478
to do network security monitoring you

128
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:20,959
have

129
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,720
you know all these different tools

130
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,360
splunk listed out and

131
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,479
some certifications as well fact

132
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,840
now today compared to say

133
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,880
uh five ten years ago you probably have

134
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,800
twice the amount of certifications that

135
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,080
i used to see

136
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,360
and so there's a trend towards

137
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,199
certifications there's a trend

138
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,479
towards college but there's one trend

139
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,479
that has stayed the same throughout

140
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,120
all of this when i start asking

141
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
questions and i'm i'm not trying to be

142
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
mean at all just like

143
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,280
okay i see you put that you've done this

144
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,600
at

145
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,400
college or it's in your skill section

146
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,960
how does that thing work

147
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,479
oh well um uh and there's a struggle to

148
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,240
answer the question and if you put it on

149
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,360
your resume

150
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,639
it's a fair game i get to ask you

151
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,479
and i'm not trying to make people fail

152
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,360
because really i'm not trying to hire

153
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,440
this is kind of crazy i'm not trying to

154
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,840
hire expertise

155
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,000
i'm trying to figure out what makes you

156
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,960
tick

157
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,600
how quickly you can learn where you've

158
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
applied yourself and

159
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,440
to be honest i found that i actually

160
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,720
have better results with

161
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,280
folks with associate's degree than

162
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,240
four-year plus

163
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,720
degrees because there's a difference

164
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,840
between

165
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,880
theory and information and

166
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,560
actually doing work it almost makes me

167
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,919
kind of wonder like we've gone to this

168
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,039
day and age where we go

169
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,240
so much towards information that i

170
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,440
almost feel like we need to trend

171
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,280
backwards towards the concept of like

172
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
apprenticeships

173
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,759
that's that's my opinion please you know

174
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,240
don't nail me to the wall

175
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,319
uh i'm giving this talk because i want

176
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,000
to help you

177
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,680
stand out i don't want to waste your

178
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,880
time i don't want to go through all

179
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,479
these things but

180
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,800
when i get in an interview and i talk to

181
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,720
someone and they're like yeah i've done

182
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,600
that in

183
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,240
a lab and i don't care whether that's

184
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,440
your lab

185
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,960
or if you work for a company that

186
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,880
hopefully gives you some lab time which

187
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,440
is

188
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,840
which is pretty rare for my employees i

189
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,639
try to give them

190
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,720
like a half a day on fridays and they

191
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,080
jump into a lab and they just get to

192
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,440
learn new things and it's

193
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,600
it's a de-stressor it helps increase

194
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,319
like productivity actually

195
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,600
that's pretty uncommon though but

196
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,360
when i start to talk about home lab

197
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,280
people actually get upset

198
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,520
i'm doing a huge youtube series that's

199
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,280
going to be like 20 to 30

200
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,919
clips long like ranging from 15 minutes

201
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,360
to an hour

202
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
and it's free i'm not charging for it

203
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,240
but i've gotten a lot of like

204
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,919
hate mail people reaching out to me and

205
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,440
like the comments at the bottom of the

206
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
slide like employers should not expect

207
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,759
me to invest in a lab on my time or i'll

208
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,479
be caught

209
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,599
dead wasting my evening or putting my

210
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,440
money to work building out a home lab

211
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,759
that

212
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,840
that's unfair it shouldn't be expected

213
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,160
and or my favorite one

214
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,319
asking about if someone has a home lab

215
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,840
is a form of

216
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,520
gatekeeping and

217
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,479
i i get this a lot and so when i'm doing

218
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,479
free videos on building a home lab it

219
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,039
kind of makes me feel

220
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,800
not dirty because i believe in what i'm

221
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,319
doing but it makes me feel like people

222
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,120
don't like me

223
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,000
and then i want to cry

224
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,080
because i think there's a misperception

225
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,199
here that

226
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,199
you know people with labs are they're

227
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,280
bragging about their half rack or full

228
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,960
server rack and

229
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,720
quite frankly some people have really

230
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,479
extensive labs they're

231
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,720
they're kind of cocky they're they brag

232
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,800
all the time they're proud but

233
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,759
not a good way and it ends up being this

234
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,360
conception of elitism

235
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,599
and then we start to think well wow in

236
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,120
order to have a lab i need

237
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,319
tons of time i need tons of money

238
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,800
because i got to buy all that equipment

239
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,120
and i better have some passion to

240
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,479
maintain that all and

241
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,280
that's not what a home lab is about like

242
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,720
you don't even have to be passionate

243
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,599
like if you

244
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,440
are in this and you're building out a

245
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,800
home lab

246
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,960
you might not necessarily even like it

247
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,840
but what are you trying to do then

248
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,599
trying to get a job

249
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,559
i'm trying to put food on the table and

250
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,279
so i want to

251
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,519
change this conception on why you should

252
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,640
do a lab

253
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,320
and really you should ask your employer

254
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,399
if you have an employer right now

255
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,440
can i have 30 minutes or an hour on one

256
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
day a week to do a lab and

257
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,720
maybe would you help buy some of the

258
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,320
software or hardware if you even need it

259
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,040
it's not about building a home lab it's

260
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,640
about sending a message

261
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,480
it's about standing out from the crowd

262
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,160
it's about you know

263
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
well why did you spend so much money to

264
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,279
go to college

265
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,839
like really like people are leaving i.t

266
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,360
colleges and they have

267
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,080
tens of thousands of dollars in debt why

268
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,839
would you do that and think of all the

269
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,839
time that goes into that

270
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,959
well well justin i i want a job

271
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,560
so why'd you go to college to get a job

272
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,399
but if everybody goes to college and

273
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,160
everybody applies

274
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
what makes me want to hire you versus

275
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,440
everybody else that went to college

276
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,279
because

277
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,279
most people in their resumes they went

278
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,320
to college

279
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,160
okay no problem i'll get some

280
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,640
certifications

281
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,440
okay so why do you get certifications

282
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,680
it's to stand out it's to help

283
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,959
get a job but here's the problem

284
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,360
and feel free to call me out on this

285
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,680
because i'm comfortable saying this

286
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,959
i have 61 certifications

287
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,519
i know for a fact how much i actually

288
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,080
grew

289
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,120
and learned studying for those certs

290
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,200
now some of them absolutely i learned a

291
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,640
ton like the gse

292
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,440
was a lot of work and it forced me to do

293
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,079
a lot of

294
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,320
hands-on labs because that was part of

295
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,240
the cert

296
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,680
in some of these i can pick up a book

297
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,760
because i went to college at wgu and it

298
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,120
was self-paced

299
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,480
so rather than doing traditional

300
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,640
learning i was buying a book from

301
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,040
amazon reading through it taking a

302
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,720
certification exam

303
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,360
once a week and any time i passed the

304
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,519
exam i passed the class

305
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,600
so i was financially motivated to go

306
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,200
boom boom boom

307
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,000
but i didn't learn a lot of applicable

308
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,640
direct

309
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,240
experience from a lot of that

310
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,959
so then i know and employers know when

311
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,560
they see those certs

312
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,959
it means you know the minimum bar to

313
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,160
pass it

314
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,760
which doesn't always mean you can

315
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
actually do that thing

316
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,279
you could have the security plus the

317
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,120
cissp you could have

318
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,480
microsoft certified security expert

319
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,240
specializations and

320
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,760
that doesn't mean you know how to roll

321
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,079
your own pki and do ipsec

322
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,839
and do knack and well but i did pass the

323
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:08,880
exam

324
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,680
so a home lab to me one of the major

325
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,480
points

326
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,959
is to get you a job to get you to stand

327
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,079
out

328
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,360
because once you start getting

329
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,120
interviewed and

330
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,959
when i interview folks like oh yeah i've

331
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,320
done that in a lab i'm not

332
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,640
maybe like a super expert but i'm

333
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
familiar with

334
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,800
active directory i'm familiar with

335
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,160
security onion

336
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,320
like it's not otherwise it's like this

337
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,680
oh yeah i've heard about that all the

338
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,399
time and

339
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,480
we learned about that in school and my

340
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,240
past employer did that but i didn't i

341
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,040
wasn't the one

342
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,079
driving but as soon as i interview

343
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,600
someone like oh yeah i've done that

344
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,760
and they usually will say well i'm not i

345
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,360
wouldn't say i'm an expert in this but

346
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:47,920
i'm

347
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,000
familiar then it's like that's what i'm

348
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,839
looking for that's what i want

349
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,800
and i want that for you because i want

350
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,720
to help you get a job or a promotion or

351
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,279
whatever

352
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,440
reason you're doing it maybe it's just

353
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
for fun because you're passionate but

354
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,000
it doesn't have to be the reason so then

355
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,079
from there what do you need

356
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,200
this is probably the biggest

357
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,040
misconception we think a home lab means

358
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
you got to buy cisco switches and you

359
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,399
got to buy a firewall

360
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,760
and you got to get all this different

361
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,839
interface and you know go on ebay buy

362
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,720
some servers

363
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,839
actually get rack mounted no

364
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,680
no all you need is the computer you're

365
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,720
watching this on

366
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,800
right now you load up a little bit of

367
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
virtualization software and

368
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,440
so to build out this lab it could be

369
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,720
free

370
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,079
this is one of the areas i've also

371
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,519
gotten a lot of hate mail because i have

372
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,000
a youtube

373
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
video showing all the possible home lab

374
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,040
equipment you might

375
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,680
want but let's be clear they're once

376
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,240
they're

377
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,639
these you know if you want a cisco

378
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,320
switch go for it but you can emulate it

379
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,000
in software and you can get a free trial

380
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,360
and learn how to use it so

381
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,079
don't don't don't overthink it from here

382
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,440
you take your laptop

383
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,079
your desktop whatever you have find a

384
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,760
computer that a company's thrown in the

385
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,680
trash can or ask them if they're

386
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,240
you know can i do a dod software wipe of

387
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,519
the hard drives or

388
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,839
can i have it without the hard drive and

389
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,360
repurpose a box

390
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,519
there's a lot of free virtualization

391
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,880
virtualbox

392
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,360
i personally prefer vmware workstation

393
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,959
and i'll pay the

394
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,880
you know whatever the license cost one

395
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,639
time so that i can have that

396
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,680
but virtualbox is almost the same thing

397
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,200
docker and kubernetes i'm sure you've

398
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,240
heard about them they're a little

399
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,519
intimidating

400
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,839
20 class on udemy and it'll show you how

401
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,240
to get started with those technologies

402
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,200
now you're deploying nginx web servers

403
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,040
and web application firewalls and

404
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,000
databases

405
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,920
and it was free completely free

406
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,480
now if you're on windows 10 you could do

407
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,279
hyper-v

408
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,120
i'm not a huge fan of that but you know

409
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,880
what it works just

410
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,240
fine for building a lab

411
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,600
prox mark proxmox sorry box marks a

412
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,079
different thing

413
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,240
proxmox if you have dedicated hardware

414
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,800
that you can do a hypervisor install

415
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,639
especially even if like you have three

416
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,480
you can do like software

417
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,199
raid sand it's not really sand it's over

418
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,240
converged

419
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,760
and you can learn what that means and

420
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,160
how to deploy it which is some cheap old

421
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,959
desktops lying around there's free isos

422
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,639
you can download for microsoft get

423
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,399
server licenses

424
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,040
cloud amazon and azure will give you

425
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,399
some free credits

426
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,560
and there's tons of other ways for low

427
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,600
cost

428
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,120
to get started so what do you

429
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,639
do with this then right you figure out

430
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,079
first why you want to build a lab what

431
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:36,880
motivates you

432
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,839
could be money right and then you start

433
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:40,720
to build things

434
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,120
out and there's a huge list of things if

435
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,160
and then maybe that's what's

436
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,240
intimidating like

437
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680
i'm gonna let you in on a little secret

438
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,360
the longer i'm in security

439
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,120
the dumber i feel

440
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,600
i have no problem saying that because

441
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,240
the more

442
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,279
i learn the more i know i

443
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,560
don't know and that's scary

444
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,240
but i think if we can come out and say

445
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,000
that and this group pancakes

446
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,880
con and all the talkers and attendees

447
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,480
this is a good group of people that

448
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,800
we've kind of shrugged that off and

449
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,519
we've come together and as we do that we

450
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,720
lift each other up

451
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,120
it doesn't have to be all huggy touchy

452
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,160
feely but

453
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,399
we're here for you and i'm glad you made

454
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,279
it

455
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,000
so if i have this huge list of things

456
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,519
and oh my gosh like

457
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,120
active directory windows event

458
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,199
forwarding web servers uh nsm

459
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,920
sim dns dhcp and capture malware data

460
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,480
like

461
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,079
i can go on and on and i didn't have

462
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,320
enough slide space to even list like

463
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,600
for the things i'm going to be covering

464
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,639
on youtube oh my gosh that's so

465
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,880
much stuff yeah you know what i've

466
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,480
interviewed hundreds of people

467
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
and i bet if i were asked hey have you

468
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,160
done this bullet in a lab

469
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
the max i would probably get is like

470
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,600
five bullets

471
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,040
and it probably would only be you know

472
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,199
two to three percent of the people i

473
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,560
interview

474
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,240
and so if you want to be a diamond in

475
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,639
the rough it might just be

476
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,199
play with a few of these okay you don't

477
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:13,759
have to do

478
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,240
all of them i've literally gone through

479
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,440
and done all these but

480
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,440
that's because i do consulting and it

481
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
directly turns into

482
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,480
money because then i can turn around and

483
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,399
do them for companies

484
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,880
that was my motivation it wasn't just

485
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,240
because i thought it was cool some of

486
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,920
these is yeah i thought it was cool

487
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,199
but then ultimately it turned into

488
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,759
consulting anyway so if you're just

489
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,600
starting what i would actually pick are

490
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,199
things that are either

491
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,759
so broad that everybody has them active

492
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,639
directory

493
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,759
so great for anybody to play with or

494
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,040
do something that's specific fun

495
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,600
easy with lots of documentation so like

496
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,199
these are some projects that there's a

497
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,480
whole lot of

498
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,519
online articles you can google you know

499
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,000
go this and security engine here's the

500
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,519
download link here's how to get it up

501
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,720
and running and

502
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,639
now you have sim and nsm even though you

503
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,240
might not know what the individual

504
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
components do

505
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,880
part of a lab try to figure out what

506
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,119
those individual components do

507
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,599
doesn't have to be in an expert level

508
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,039
and the fact that you got some of these

509
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,319
up and running and you've

510
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,520
maybe played with tuning them that's an

511
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,359
amazing feat polar proxy what the heck

512
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,480
is that

513
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,919
that's where you crack open tls and tls

514
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,960
sessions like i reach out to google

515
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,480
i reach out to um you know youtube and

516
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,200
all them

517
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,919
they're https and if you're running

518
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,520
things like wireshark or network

519
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,720
security monitoring

520
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,320
you can't see the payload but if on my

521
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,039
lab i put polar proxy in the middle

522
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,360
all of a sudden i can and i can do

523
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,880
packet captures and all

524
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,320
like snort circada and if i can even get

525
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,080
that working and i say hey

526
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,480
i've done ssl inspection with polar

527
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
proxy they're gonna be like what

528
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,679
you've done that before what did that

529
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,760
look like that's cool

530
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,679
plus you know for those of you who are

531
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,520
monitoring your kids

532
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,760
it's pretty interesting p of sense free

533
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,880
open source firewall

534
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,559
you can do it on hardware or a virtual

535
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,960
machine and you're just goofing off with

536
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,000
application control and web proxy and

537
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,480
pie hole you get a whole bunch of ads

538
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,799
block them with pie holes basically dns

539
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,760
sinkholding

540
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,960
it's easy simple and fun and

541
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,400
that's that's where you want to kind of

542
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,080
start is where things kind of

543
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,919
stroud that line of hobby versus career

544
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,039
raspberry pies you can buy like an eight

545
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,400
dollar raspberry pi

546
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,840
like a pie zero w slow as molasses

547
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,160
but it works it works it's cheap like

548
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,640
you can show your kids like hey here's

549
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080
this you know eight dollar

550
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,320
computer i want you to learn how to

551
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,840
stand up an nginx web server and

552
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,200
don't tell them that it was only ten

553
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,960
dollars

554
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,360
or eight dollars right let them learn

555
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,880
and have like that uh

556
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,200
you know father-son father-daughter or

557
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,120
mother-son mother-daughter experience

558
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,320
if if they're interested my kids

559
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,480
they're not interested in computers but

560
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,160
they think it's hilarious when i can

561
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,720
control

562
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,799
light bulbs or their little lego

563
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,160
robotics

564
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,640
with these and to be honest i'm not that

565
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,480
interested in robotics but i love the

566
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,000
fact that they are so it

567
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,720
it kind of bonds us together and there's

568
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,400
guides on how to deploy some of this

569
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:30,960
like

570
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,200
palatar the windows event forwarding can

571
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,039
be really intimidating with lots of

572
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,160
settings and

573
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,400
they've got tons of documentation and

574
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,919
walk through and

575
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,760
start with things that you can actually

576
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,960
follow

577
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,160
and there's one thing you're going to

578
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,240
get out of this that i think is so

579
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,360
important and that's when you go into it

580
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,720
anything in i.t especially infosec

581
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,320
we have this issue of i don't know what

582
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
i like i don't know what i want to do

583
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,600
and well i'm in cyber defense i'm

584
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,840
biased i i think cyber defense is

585
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,440
awesome it's the best and

586
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
so the videos i usually do are around

587
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,039
cyber defense

588
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,200
but there's specialties off cyber

589
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,280
defense and maybe you don't like cyber

590
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,159
defense

591
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,520
maybe you'd rather be like a

592
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,760
forensicator an auditor

593
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,679
maybe you want to do red team or pen

594
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,400
testing i don't care

595
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,080
because what matters is that you've

596
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,559
dabbled you've goofed off

597
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,919
in a lab until you're like that that was

598
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:32,880
cool

599
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,039
that that's something i might want to do

600
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,880
to earn an income

601
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,039
or maybe i'm doing something right now

602
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,600
but i don't really like it and again

603
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,840
you don't have to be super passionate

604
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,840
like i love my job i'm very

605
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,559
fortunate i thank god for that but maybe

606
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,080
you don't and that's fine

607
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,159
so just pick whatever's the least evil

608
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,919
that helps you make the income for you

609
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,360
or your family

610
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,720
a home lab is one of the number one ways

611
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,280
to help you figure that out so

612
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,120
where do you start this was a

613
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,159
a live stream i did uh and actually

614
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,240
take this screen and like multiply it by

615
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,320
four because i had to go to the left

616
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,120
to the right and up and down and you can

617
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,480
probably see in the background i've got

618
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,640
like some whiteboards over there and

619
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,159
we were just on a live stream i was like

620
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,400
hey i'm i'm gonna walk through how to

621
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,240
stand up a home lab and i'm gonna

622
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,760
anything we draw i will make a video on

623
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,360
but it was a live stream so i was like

624
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,880
so if there's something i'm leaving out

625
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,159
that you think we should cover

626
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,880
let's do it and it's supposed to be an

627
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,440
hour

628
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,840
an hour and 15 minutes and you can see

629
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,080
my handwriting here is horrendous

630
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,400
but we did like all sorts of on-prem

631
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,880
things web proxies we went to cloud

632
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,400
terraforming and you know hypervisors

633
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,720
virtualization platforms we did uh

634
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
data center controls on a different

635
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,240
screen and

636
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,440
that's intimidating that that's a ton of

637
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,400
stuff

638
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
and it took me a long time to learn all

639
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,080
that and you don't need to learn all of

640
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,760
that

641
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,640
but if i'm trying to get into a home lab

642
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,520
which of these

643
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,960
boxes or circles or chicken scratch

644
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,919
do you recommend well again my goal for

645
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,039
you is to probably

646
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,640
dabble enough to be scary play around

647
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,919
with and figure out what you

648
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,760
like the most out of the things you

649
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,000
played with do a little bit of forensics

650
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,280
do a little bit of

651
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,679
offense pen test red teaming play with

652
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,400
scripting powershell python and

653
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,200
in what i'm trying to do and my promise

654
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,600
to you

655
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,480
is all of those items that i've had

656
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
bullet points on here

657
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,039
i'm going to over the next 20 to 30

658
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:45,600
weeks

659
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,720
i'm gonna youtube them all out free no

660
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,840
cost

661
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,240
so what i would recommend and this is a

662
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,679
i'd say it's self-interest but i don't

663
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,600
make any money off of this but

664

if any of this stuff about a home lab

667
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,360
makes sense to you

668
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,799

670
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,360
other ones there's ones on pluralsight

671
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,760
medium.com has plenty of really good

672
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,520
documentation

673
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,919
but i'm going to hit it hard from the

674
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,200
ground up

675
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,440
from hardware recommendations all you

676
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,039
really need is a laptop

677
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,720
to virtualization whether it's a

678
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,960
hypervisor or software on top of your

679
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,559
laptop or desktop

680
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,080
and i'm going to go up through active

681
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,240
directory public key infrastructure

682
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,400
network security monitoring sim

683
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,720
cloud how to integrate the two get logs

684
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,880
from all the things and

685
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,679
it's going to be slowly built out in 15

686
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,240
minute

687
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,559
to 60 minute video clips over the next

688
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,559
20 to 30 weeks

689
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,080
so if that's something that interests

690
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,840
you check that out because you shouldn't

691
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,880
be doing your lab

692
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,120
all at once you're gonna get burnt out

693
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,279
plan for it i had one team member

694
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,120
fantastic gentleman

695
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,640
super passionate overly passionate

696
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,400
he burned himself out real quick and i

697
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,480
had to keep hey slow down like

698
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,080
i get that you're ramped up right now

699
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,679
but when you start hitting it and he was

700
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,960
doing like

701
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,000
20 hours a week plus building out a lab

702
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,960
i was like

703
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,559
and you're hitting the wall and rather

704
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,080
than trying to stop and breathe you're

705
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,679
just banging your head against the wall

706
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,880
and

707
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,720
you shouldn't do it all at once do it in

708
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,559
small increments

709
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,480
actually when you grow the most is often

710
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,080
when you do small

711
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,200
increments if you're disciplined

712
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,039
maybe you're trying to do like 10 to 30

713
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,559
minutes a day

714
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,480
i would still say that might be too much

715
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,159
like you know

716
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,159
spend maybe a few hours a week don't do

717
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,279
it all at once and

718
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,279
you went to college potentially for

719
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,320
years

720
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
studying for certifications is hard and

721
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,480
it takes time

722
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,640
home lab you can actually go much deeper

723
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,480
and get much more hands-on experience

724
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,159
and oddly

725
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,679
it's not the same time frame like

726
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,440
if i'm getting a microsoft search on

727
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,120
active directory well it's like three

728
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,720
different certs it's covered in and you

729
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,000
have to study a whole bunch

730
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,480
maybe a week per thing you could stand

731
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,400
up active directory in like an hour from

732
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,679
googling it

733
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,200
and then when things break and you're

734
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,720
like i don't know why this works you

735
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,120
learn

736
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,440
so much so

737
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,840
hopefully i've kind of shared

738
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,960
misconceptions

739
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,600
and why a home lab actually matters and

740
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,360
i i hope you take that to heart

741
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,279
and i if it helps you get a job or

742
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,880
change your mentality please let me know

743
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,000
i'd love to hear it

744
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,279
rather than some of the other bad

745
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,600
comments but with that being said

746
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,240
let's let's move to my other half let's

747
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,360
let's go to

748
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,200
the hobby farm and

749
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,720
this stuff's fun this

750
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,400
this personifies to me the hobby farm

751
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,600
life

752
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,240
i've got eight miniature horses

753
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,159
by miniature i mean like i'm sitting in

754
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,559
a chair like armrests down

755
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,000
size they're tiny uh miniature cows you

756
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,120
can see my wife

757
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,400
scratching the chin of one of our

758
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,279
miniature cows we have two of those

759
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,200
they actually lived in our house for a

760
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,640
few weeks when they're babies

761
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,930
oh it's so adorable

762
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,520
[Laughter]

763
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
we've got two miniature donkeys those

764
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,880
are my boys there

765
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,320
you can see they're scratching the chins

766
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,679
like there's a lot of chin scratching

767
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,960
around here

768
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,760
i've got five or six cats you can see

769
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,360
the one in the sink

770
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,760
i've got two golden retrievers and i've

771
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,960
got a

772
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,440
toy slash miniature dachshund who's like

773
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,240
all of

774
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,000
i want to say eight pounds uh the uh

775
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,559
the other black dog in here which is a

776
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,240
bernice mountain dog

777
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,840
is actually my mom's who lives right on

778
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,360
the property with me

779
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,919
and so we've had two baby horses we've

780
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,159
got about 20 chickens

781
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,080
uh four guinea hens which are those

782
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,159
really weird looking

783
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,880
like skin flapping things by the

784
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,400
chickens in the picture

785
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,320
got a few rabbits uh two goats

786
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,440
and i'm i'm probably missing something

787
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,799
oh we have four geese

788
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,679
and we have some ponds with fish and

789
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,880
lots of animals

790
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,360
so when i say hobby farm it's not about

791
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,240
like planting and growing crops

792
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,279
like a traditional farm hobby farm is in

793
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,399
animals we don't eat any of our animals

794
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,200
i'm a huge softie so i just i couldn't

795
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,120
even do it if i tried i don't hunt

796
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,640
i have nothing against it i just don't

797
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,880
do that uh we do eat

798
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,600
eggs from the chickens and the guineas

799
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,279
and i can tell you once you start having

800
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,559
farm fresh eggs

801
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,279
it's really hard to do store-bought eggs

802
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,200
and you see me in the little go-kart

803
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,840
with my

804
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,600
you can barely see my son with a little

805
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,919
spiky hat riding with me and

806
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,200
i've got three kids in the hobby farm i

807
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,000
just want to say it has really brought

808
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,760
our family together

809
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,200
uh and it's actually been a huge help

810
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,840
for bringing my local community together

811
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,799
like we do like a

812
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,679
we've done junior high ministry uh we've

813
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,399
done

814
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,559
uh my my daughter's girl scouts and we

815
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,080
have like a bridge that goes over our

816
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,279
pond and they've done like their

817
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,520
bridging ceremonies there and

818
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,960
we have a lot of get-togethers and it's

819
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,600
just

820
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,320
it's like all about community and i love

821
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,279
it

822
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,039
couldn't have dreamed for anything even

823
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,480
better and it's interesting because my

824
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,840
wife there

825
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,440
she didn't like animals when we were

826
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,919
dating like not even like dogs

827
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,600
and she's the one that wanted the cows

828
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,919
and now like i've changed her to the

829
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,120
dark side of the force

830
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,320
so if i'm talking about hobby farm

831
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,080
i think i need to be honest about what's

832
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
the the good side of it as well as

833
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,520
what's the bad

834
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,919
and so if i'm at like a sans conference

835
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:46,720
or i'm not about

836
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,760
folks here about this hobby there's

837
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,440
always like the same kind of questions

838
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,240
like

839
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,279
wow that uh that seems like a lot of

840
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:55,840
work

841
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,360
like even as soon as i mentioned like we

842
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
have horses they're like wow

843
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,960
that would be cool but i could never

844
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,559
keep up with that that's just

845
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,600
it's just a lot well

846
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,240
it's not really as bad as you think it

847
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,640
is

848
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,840
like maybe a few times a year you do

849
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,520
have to clean poop out of the stalls

850
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,480
but to be honest horses don't really

851
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,919
want to be in the stalls

852
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,840
if it's a nice day they're out and about

853
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,240
eating grass and moving around

854
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,559
so the stalls only get a bunch of poop

855
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,360
in them

856
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
like when it's raining or storming

857
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,320
because they want to get out of the

858
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,279
weather

859
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,360
it's really not that bad unless you're

860
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,200
like doing show horses in which they're

861
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,640
locked in the

862
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,399
the stall all year round i don't do that

863
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,840
all of ours are out and about

864
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,480
that's where i want them if you have an

865
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,159
old fence like when i bought the house

866
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,760
i'm at it was an older fence and so

867
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,600
occasionally like you bump into it it's

868
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,520
like it'd fall off it's like

869
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
so you'd have to go nail up with you but

870
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,559
i've replaced the fence since then and

871
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,000
i won't have to maintain anything for a

872
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,840
while and i put up the white vinyl fence

873
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,799
so i really shouldn't have to do

874
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:57,600
anything

875
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,320
for a long time occasionally animals get

876
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:00,960
hurt

877
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,360
that vet bill can be kind of expensive

878
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,200
uh to be honest i would actually say

879
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,960
animals getting hurt or dying is

880
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,760
probably one of the number one drawbacks

881
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,799
i'm a big softy so

882
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,640
like if you have to have an animal put

883
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,000
down because they're

884
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,360
you know just bad things happen um

885
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,080
something you do have to deal with my

886
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,520
kids

887
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,440
my daughter my son ha i feel like

888
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,120
they've grown a lot

889
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,799
because i don't hide them from that kind

890
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,120
of stuff i remember being at walmart

891
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,880
back when they had fish

892
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,640
and i was there with my daughter and

893
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,320
there was another dad with uh

894
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,120
i believe a son and the son's like oh

895
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,120
daddy the fish is dead

896
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,960
he's like oh no son it's just sleeping

897
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,200
i look at my daughter i was like he's

898
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,320
dead

899
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,159
and he just looks at me like what's

900
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,520
wrong with you it's like um

901
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,080
i'm sorry i my daughter's used to this

902
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
we have afar

903
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,240
it's like oops i ran my mouth i should

904
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,440
have been quiet

905
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,159
uh and it's sad but when you acknowledge

906
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:02,559
that

907
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,399
like i felt like that's helped even when

908
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,000
like some of grandparents and stuff

909
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,360
passed away like

910
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,519
they accept the grief they acknowledge

911
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,000
it and again i feel like hobby farm has

912
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
really brought our family together

913
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,519
you'll have to buy some like water

914
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,960
heaters and stuff because in the winter

915
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,720
you can't have the water freezing and

916
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,480
probably what's the most kind of pain

917
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,519
is i have to store hay once a year

918
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,720
so like end of summer early fall

919
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,320
i have to get like two to three hundred

920
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,039
bales and get it up in our hay loft

921
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,919
but our hay comes directly from our land

922
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:36,559
so i don't

923
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,600
buy it it's free and what i do is half

924
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,679
the hay goes to a local farmer and then

925
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:42,960
i get the other half

926
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,480
in exchange for him coming with his

927
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,240
equipment so it's a

928
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,039
nice little deal and we have an

929
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,960
electronic conveyor belt one of those

930
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,679
tire

931
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,679
tile conveyor belts we bought at an

932
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,519
auction for like 50 bucks

933
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,840
and so we put the hay on it and it moves

934
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,279
it up into the hail off and someone

935
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,640
takes it off and

936
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,240
it takes one day so one day probably

937
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,000
it's probably like four to six hours of

938
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,720
work it's hot it's not very fun

939
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,159
but then you're done so labor-wise if i

940
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,919
actually like plot this out

941
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,159
this might be mind blowing i'm actually

942
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,120
gonna say like

943
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,320
my golden retrievers are substantially

944
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,760
more work

945
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,120
than all of my horses donkeys cows

946
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,799
goats combined

947
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,039
how is that possible justin well because

948
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,880
the dogs you have to constantly let in

949
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,919
and out of the house to go to the

950
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,880
bathroom they sometimes track in mud and

951
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,720
you know like there's like the feeding

952
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,320
and all like they're more work

953
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,760
with horses in my farm we feed twice a

954
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,600
day because there's grass everywhere

955
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,279
and even whenever it's winter you throw

956
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,880
down like bales of hay

957
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,440
and they're good for the day so we do

958
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,399
grain

959
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,120
twice a day that takes five minutes if

960
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,919
you're in a rush

961
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,279
probably closer to 10 but 15 minutes is

962
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,919
kind of the upper bound and to be honest

963
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,880
i don't feed anymore my nine-year-old

964
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,640
daughter does it she gets on our little

965
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,480
golf cart and drives around

966
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,279
she gets up at six o'clock or 5 30 in

967
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,080
the morning

968
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,320
she doesn't have to and i didn't ask her

969
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,440
to do this

970
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,480
like i'm super proud daddy by the way

971
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,360
like she has to be at school at 7 45 so

972
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,000
she could feed

973
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
it like 7 20 7 15 7 o'clock

974
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,240
but she likes getting up so early in the

975
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,159
morning because then instead of being

976
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,440
10 minutes to feed she spends time with

977
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,519
them and pets them and loves on them and

978
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,399
it's like

979
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,960
that's cool so i don't even feed she

980
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,320
does it in the morning she doesn't

981
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,039
evening

982
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,320
i'll join her every once in a while

983
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,919
and everything outside of that is just

984
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,519
the family spending time with the

985
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,799
animals

986
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,519
which means these are more of you can

987
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,279
kind of let them do their thing

988
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,360
or you spend time with them and if

989
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,120
you're going on vacation

990
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,200
well you can front load hay like you can

991
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,039
do a big old round bale

992
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,880
you can technically like i hire someone

993
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
to just check on them just because

994
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,480
i like to make sure all the animals are

995
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,079
taken care of while i'm gone

996
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,000
but the grain is more of to get them to

997
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,599
come up and get used to being around

998
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,719
humans

999
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,800
to let us pet on them check to make sure

1000
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,040
everybody's okay nobody's hurt

1001
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,359
it's not actually a requirement because

1002
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,239
think of like

1003
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,639
wild animals what do they live off of

1004
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,040
the land

1005
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,000
so so to put the whole cost perspective

1006
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,719
time wise is actually very minimal

1007
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,000
the cost there is some cost like i buy

1008
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,440
eight dollars bags of

1009
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,399
uh sweet grain technically i buy like

1010
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,918
chick food and a few other things but i

1011
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,000
don't buy i have to get it that often

1012
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,440
but like for all the horses donkeys cows

1013
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,480
goats

1014
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,960
it's an eight dollar bag one bag will

1015
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,239
last approximately

1016
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,599
six feedings six feedings is basically

1017
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,880
three days right so with eight mini

1018
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,720
horses too many cows too many donkeys

1019
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,240
one full-size horse twenty chickens four

1020
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,079
geese four getting hands two rabbits and

1021
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,480
again i probably left some things out it

1022
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,440
equates to

1023
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,079
roughly four hundred dollars a month you

1024
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:10,560
know

1025
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,520
here's the technical aspect of my hobby

1026
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,119
side

1027
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,560
eight dollars per bag six feeds but i'm

1028
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,440
technically doing like four uh a day

1029
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,200
because i have two different barns

1030
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,560
times 30 days 360 a month plus the

1031
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,480
random like chick feed rabbit feed stuff

1032
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,200
like that

1033
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,560
it's about 400 a month so 400

1034
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,960
a month and probably 30 minutes a day

1035
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,560
is kind of the upper bounds now again

1036
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,160
i spend way more time with the animals

1037
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,680
in 30 minutes

1038
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,520
maybe not each day but that's because

1039
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,359
the whole reason i have them is to enjoy

1040
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,400
them

1041
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,040
but the requirements 10 to 30 minutes a

1042
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,000
day feeding

1043
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,839
and even then you don't technically have

1044
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,079
to do that

1045
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,480
well all right justin i feel like you're

1046
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,079
being a little conservative on the cost

1047
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,599
there because what about like the big

1048
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,839
old tractor that uh you know

1049
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,960
old macdonald had i don't

1050
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,079
i don't have a tractor i know like i

1051
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,680
my dad used to have a really old one

1052
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,440
that we'd use but when it broke down we

1053
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,680
didn't replace it

1054
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,760
because i don't need one i don't even

1055
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,359
have a four-wheeler

1056
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,839
i have a really good lawnmower because i

1057
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,599
have 16.5 acres

1058
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,640
uh i probably have to mow four or five

1059
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,320
acres like around our ponds and stuff

1060
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,040
but the rest

1061
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,800
are fenced in that the horses and

1062
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,160
animals can eat

1063
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,079
so i still have a decent amount of

1064
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,280
mowing to do but

1065
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,760
the largest costs with a hobby farm are

1066
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,440
the land and house

1067
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,200
by far the animals themselves can be

1068
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,880
kind of expensive like the miniature

1069
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,119
cows that's not a very common thing so

1070
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,839
i want to say they were like two or

1071
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,520
three grand a cow which was a

1072
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,200
kind of ridiculous amount of money but

1073
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,040
my wife really wanted them and so happy

1074
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,040
birthday right

1075
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,000
and we have a golf cart in fact you

1076
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,040
might

1077
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,400
hear them in the background because my

1078
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,480
kids are goofing off i can tell

1079
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,079
and that was bought used so we probably

1080
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,359
have all the animals in plus the golf

1081
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,079
cart

1082
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,000
the zero turn came with the property i

1083
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,079
bought

1084
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,200
maybe ten thousand dollars in because

1085
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,240
some of the animals aren't that

1086
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,280
expensive maybe

1087
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,960
20 at the max but that's just because i

1088
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,320
have so many miniature horses and

1089
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,400
they're a little bit more pricey but

1090
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,520
i want to say it was closer to 10. and

1091
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,800
really when you're factoring like is a

1092
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
hobby farm for me

1093
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,160
well if you don't like animals the

1094
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,279
answer is no

1095
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,480
but the total cost of ownership i feel i

1096
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,079
swear this is because i'm in i.t

1097
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,760
and i have to maintain budgets and stuff

1098
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,000
like that but the total cost of

1099
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,640
ownership

1100
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,560
if you like consider all the factors

1101
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,320
i actually feel like being on a hobby

1102
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,079
farm is cheaper than what most of you

1103
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,520
all are doing

1104
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,920
what do i mean by that well in order to

1105
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,880
buy land

1106
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,280
and have animals you have to be in an

1107
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,800
area that allows like

1108
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,480
you can't have chickens in the city they

1109
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,839
don't allow that it's against city

1110
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,839
ordinances or laws

1111
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,920
so you have to find land that's usually

1112
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,680
right on the outskirts of the city it

1113
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,960
might still be considered

1114
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,680
you know part of the township or you

1115
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,079
might be

1116
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,160
outside of it well when you're on the

1117
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,000
outskirts or out of the country

1118
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,040
i'm one block outside of city limits i'm

1119
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,720
right in the middle of town but i'm one

1120
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,000
block outside

1121
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,640
i don't have to pay taxes city taxes

1122
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,880
cha-ching yeah right

1123
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,359
on top of that because i'm in this type

1124
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,520
of area

1125
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,599
land and housing is substantially

1126
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,800
cheaper than

1127
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,440
other places like even in towns let

1128
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,720
alone cities like

1129
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,680
i live in roughly a 4300 square foot

1130
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,640
house

1131
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,079
with two outdoor barns and a shed

1132
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,680
and another outbuilding and all of that

1133
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,800
plus you know the really nice house

1134
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,280
and a hot tub and like all these nice

1135
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,880
things

1136
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,040
but it cost me probably less than it

1137
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,960
would cost you to live in a two-bedroom

1138
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,320
apartment in the city of the rest of

1139
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,920
your life

1140
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,400
so the cost because of where you might

1141
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,359
relocate

1142
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,280
assuming you can do like work for home

1143
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,960
and stuff like that which is

1144
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,760
more common now than ever could be

1145
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,640
cheaper

1146
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,040
and building all those family member

1147
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,320
memories

1148
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,800
that's priceless there's my son sitting

1149
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,599
underneath my

1150
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,160
uplift standing desk likes to watch his

1151
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,839
tablet and you know smack my legs

1152
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,400
try to get my attention the cat here the

1153
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,800
gray ones my three-legged tripod cat

1154
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,440
love that cat my daughter's constantly

1155
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,200
in the field with the horses and

1156
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,280
i love hobby farms so

1157
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,800
i don't know whether i persuaded it to

1158
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,400
you and if not

1159
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,680
at least you got to see some cute

1160
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,078
pictures

1161
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,480
so okay we're all end and then if

1162
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,760
there's any questions or time for

1163
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,200
questions we'll do that and if not

1164
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,040

through in the uh in the slide channel

1188

1191
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,880

animals so

1199
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,800
i would say they would taste better than

1200
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,400
store-bought but i don't eat my chickens

1201
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,040
and stuff like that

1202
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,520
and i'm not like john strand with a mine

1203
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,040
shaft um

1204
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,560
that'd be cool so

1205
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,240
i would be open to doing a bed and

1206
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,480
breakfast that would be cool and i i

1207
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,720
seriously am planning on

1208
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,280
doing a petting zoo like maybe like

1209
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,040
facebook where it's only like every so

1210
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,079
many weekends

1211
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,240
uh throughout the year and there's one

1212
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,760
thing i really want to do that if you

1213
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,400
ever own animals especially

1214
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,960
ones that aren't as common like horses

1215
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,440
um

1216
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,920
i want to do where children who have

1217
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,119
been

1218
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,319
abused physically sexually any way

1219
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:51,440
uh that they can basically pair up with

1220
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,200
an animal spend time with them and learn

1221
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,880
that like there's trust and

1222
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,560
there's love and life is good because

1223
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,839
i just think that would be really cool

1224
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,200
so

1225
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,359
