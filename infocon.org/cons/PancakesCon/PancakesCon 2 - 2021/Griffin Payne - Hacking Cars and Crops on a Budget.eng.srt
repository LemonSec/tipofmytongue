1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,360
up next we have hacking cars

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,240
and crops on a budget with griffin payne

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,560
so

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,320
thanks everybody for taking your time

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,320
out of a sunday afternoon to join us

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,559
and thank you to the pancakes con

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,240
organizers and volunteers for putting

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,440
this all together it's

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,240
good fun so today we're going to be

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,400
talking about hacking cars and crops

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,640
on a budget so let's begin

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,960
there you go so who am i i'm griffin

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,599
payne

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,679
and in my professional life i'm an

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,719
associate director

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,640
on productivity's attack and penetration

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,880
testing team and what that means is i

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,800
spend a lot of my time on the phone

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,719
and doing powerpoint presentations and

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,200
not so much hands-on hacking these days

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,360
but in a former life i was a pen tester

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,879
and previous to that

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,360
i've done ir blue team compliance and

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,800
everything in between

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,520
oddly enough i never wanted or intended

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,000
to be

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,640
in security or rit i wanted to be a

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
video editor when i was in school

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,320
but trying to get a job doing that in

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,079
cleveland was a bit hard so i got a job

31
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,239
doing help desk and kind of progressed

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,920
through the years into security and here

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,880
we are in my personal life i'm a husband

34
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,400
and father of two young boys

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
so i don't have much free time at all

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,280
anymore i like to collect art and scotch

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,280
so i'm pretty excited about nick

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,320
britton's

39
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,840
rare collectibles talk here in a little

40
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,080
bit i like growing plants which you will

41
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,640
see here

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,880
in a moment i'm an outdoor lover i'm

43
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,479
living in denver now so

44
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,280
lots to do out here big fan of animals i

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,040
have some dogs and cats and i'm not a

46
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,960
very serious person at all as you can

47
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,240
tell from this

48
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,840
picture of me in a hot dog suit at

49
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,079
defcon china a few years ago

50
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,520
and we'll talk more about that in a few

51
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,839
minutes

52
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,000
so before we start i'd like to throw out

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,200
a disclaimer so

54
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,520
what is presented in this content what

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,799
i'm going to be talking about

56
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,040
could be used for nefarious purposes and

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,560
you are solely responsible for what you

58
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,880
choose to do with this information

59
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,119
and it's all made for educational

60
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,119
purposes there's plenty of research

61
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,560
online that you can go find

62
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,399
that will help enable you to build these

63
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,320
things but it's entirely up to you what

64
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,520
you do with it

65
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,318
so with that a lot of the techniques and

66
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,239
tactics i'm going to talk about on the

67
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,599
automotive side

68
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,040
are dated so there's nothing

69
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,959
groundbreaking or zero day coming out

70
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:15,680
here

71
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,840
it's all things that have been out in

72
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,200
the wild for a long time

73
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
but the intent of this talk is to show

74
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
you what you can do with a very small

75
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,760
budget

76
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,000
and a little perseverance and dedication

77
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,680
and willingness to learn

78
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,319
so a lot of these techniques still work

79
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,000
on older models but some of the newer

80
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,560
models

81
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,840
have mitigated a lot of the things that

82
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,440
we're going to talk about or just scrap

83
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,000
technology

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,160
all together now that being said

85
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,519
so when i used to present to automotive

86
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,120
companies oems as they're called

87
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,840
original equipment manufacturers

88
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
to talk about testing and why testing is

89
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,599
important to them this was the pitch i

90
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,800
would use to start

91
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,239
so here we go imagine you're driving

92
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:56,959
down the street

93
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,280
nice summer day you got the windows down

94
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,120
you're just listening to some music

95
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,000
and all of a sudden the music cuts off

96
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,640
and

97
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,080
you get this weird error message on your

98
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,680
infotainment screen you're like what is

99
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,400
that

100
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,280
start tapping on it tapping on it boom

101
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,800
ransomware

102
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,519
my car how is that possible and when we

103
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,120
used to say this to the automotive

104
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,560
companies they're like yeah

105
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,440
right ransomware car but then it started

106
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,760
happening to refrigerators and

107
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,200
thermostats and things like that and

108
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,280
like okay maybe this does apply to us

109
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,440
maybe we should listen

110
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,599
now to give a little back story about

111
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,920
when i first got into automotive testing

112
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,560
i honestly didn't think i would ever be

113
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,920
able to do it i never thought i was a

114
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,440
good tester i'm still not a good tester

115
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,560
there's plenty of people that are way

116
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,920
better than me

117
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
and then coming from traditional i.t

118
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,319
systems into the automotive world

119
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,959
knowing how much time and money is spent

120
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,560
producing these vehicles and

121
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,400
you know airplanes and things in the

122
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,319
transportation industry

123
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,159
i assume it would just be like top of

124
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,799
the line technology and state-of-the-art

125
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,599
tools and software and in reality that's

126
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,640
not the case

127
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,439
so when there's a software vulnerability

128
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,280
people like microsoft or cisco push out

129
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,439
a security patch in 30 days 60 days 90

130
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,799
days whatever

131
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,439
and it fixes the vulnerability in

132
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,439
automotive or transportation or

133
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,199
you know gaming with slot machines and

134
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,560
things like that anything that's

135
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,959
built on hardware with software overlaid

136
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,479
isn't as easy to fix

137
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,080
so when a vulnerability is found in a

138
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,759
piece of hardware

139
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,000
you can't just push out a software patch

140
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,600
and fix it in a lot of cases

141
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,960
and once it's discovered it's out there

142
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,040
recalls are really expensive the

143
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,960
production life cycle on vehicles and

144
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,400
planes and trains and things like that

145
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,160
is really long it could be anywhere from

146
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
one to 15 years from

147
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,440
product inception to design requirements

148
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,680
definitions prototyping tests

149
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,160
prototyping again and then production so

150
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,919
when a vulnerability is found

151
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,320
it's a long time coming before you can

152
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,040
push out a

153
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,280
for it and then when you're building

154
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,240
these things

155
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,759
you don't anticipate with the attack

156
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,280
surface or the techniques you're going

157
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
to look like in 10 15 years

158
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,479
so when you i began testing automotives

159
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,320
i didn't think i'd be able to do it but

160
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,240
then you jump in and you see things like

161
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,560
telnet and clear text protocols

162
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,120
and linux operating system with sc linux

163
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
features turned off because

164
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,160
it makes infotainment units slower to

165
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,240
boot and it's a lot easier to test than

166
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,960
you might think

167
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,880
so get the preconception out of your

168
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,000
head that you won't be able to do

169
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,880
it because anybody can do it and we all

170
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,080
start somewhere

171
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,520
if you want to get more into automotive

172
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,280
testing i highly recommend popping into

173
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,400
the automotive

174
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
village the car hacking village those

175
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,759
guys are way smarter than me

176
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,280
they virtualized a lot of things so you

177
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,800
can get in there and play with stuff

178
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,680
and it's it's really good learning

179
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,880
experience you're not going to break

180
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,680
anything you're not going to hurt

181
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,639
anybody

182
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,360
so absolutely talk to those guys pop in

183
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,840
there and

184
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,400
ask questions now that we got that out

185
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,360
of the way

186
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,639
let's get into it so the

187
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,240
point of this talk is to show what you

188
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,880
can do on a very limited budget

189
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,600
on both growing crops and hacking cars

190
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,280
so our first example is going to be a

191
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,919
homemade

192
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,639
passive keyless entry start amplifier

193
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,400
slash relapse

194
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,240
now if you're not familiar with the

195
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,840
passive keyless entry start i'm sure

196
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
most of you are it's when you walk up to

197
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,000
a vehicle

198
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,240
the keys are in your hand or your pocket

199
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,759
and you touch the handle of the car and

200
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,120
it unlocks and you didn't do anything

201
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,039
with keys where you get in the car

202
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,160
and you don't put the keys in the

203
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,639
ignition you just push the start button

204
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,560
now the way this works is the car emits

205
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,919
a high frequency signal when you're in

206
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,280
close proximity

207
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,280
and the keys respond with a low

208
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,720
frequency signal so yeah we're right

209
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,199
here

210
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,880
you know open up now when this technique

211
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,960
was first hitting the scene you know 10

212
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,880
15 years ago whatever it was

213
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,360
police were dumbfounded when they saw

214
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,960
the home security footage of these

215
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,720
criminals going to houses

216
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,000
and holding something up to the side of

217
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,080
the house another guy would open the car

218
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,759
start it and drive off in less than two

219
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,759
minutes so when they found one of these

220
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,960
devices they figured out

221
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,080
that's what was happening and then we

222
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,720
were talking to oems about this and

223
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,919
everybody always downplayed it they're

224
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:02,400
like oh

225
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,160
it's not going to happen to us it's you

226
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
know it takes very sophisticated

227
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,160
equipment or it's really expensive

228
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,840
whatever the case we're like hold my

229
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,520
beard watch

230
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,800
so we built this using

231
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,400
really cheap components so what you see

232
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,319
here is a spool of copper wire

233
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,759
a breadboard holding all these

234
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,840
components together a microcontroller

235
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,319
with about

236
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,800
30 lines of c code and a battery and

237
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,319
it's all stuffed into a defibrillator

238
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,360
case because that's what we're laying

239
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,319
around

240
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,560
so all of this is done for less than 20

241
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,599
in less than a day

242
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,280
and this is what it can do so

243
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
in this video here the keys are inside

244
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,479
the house

245
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,479
this green thing in my right hand acts

246
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,080
as a receiver so it takes a signal from

247
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,199
the vehicle

248
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,360
and amplifies it through the box to the

249
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,879
keys in the house which then respond

250
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,240
with the low frequency signal which

251
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,360
travels further

252
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:59,840
and let me show you how this works

253
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,160
um

254
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
and that was all done in less than 30

255
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,479
seconds so

256
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,799
this is you know a serious problem for

257
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,640
car thieves and

258
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,240
newer cars have mitigated this in the

259
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,479
new key fobs but this is still a very

260
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,000
prevalent attack my wife's friend

261
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
out here in denver actually had her car

262
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,360
stolen a few weeks ago and this was the

263
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,440
suspected technique because

264
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,519
no signs of forced entry it was in and

265
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,200
out in less than two minutes

266
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,480
still a very real attack

267
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,720
um another point to mention there if you

268
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,240
heard the two beeps in the car i'm not

269
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,959
sure if you did

270
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,800
it's the car alerting me that the keys

271
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,720
aren't in it as a thief

272
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,839
i don't care i'm driving this to a

273
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,440
shipping container dropping it off

274
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,160
getting paid

275
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,200
i don't need the keys but it's an

276
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,240
audible alert

277
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,320
because you can't disable the vehicle

278
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,360
while it's in motion because

279
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,959
safety hazard so this isn't going to

280
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,480
stop anybody from stealing your car if

281
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,800
you're still inclined

282
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,320
now the next technique we're going to

283
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,000
talk about is using software-defined

284
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,800
radios

285
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,240
now this will be the most expensive tool

286
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,320
in the bag they range anywhere from

287
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
thirty to three hundred fifty dollars

288
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,200
the hack rf1 is probably my favorite and

289
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,720
one i see most often in the field

290
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,000
because it operates

291
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,240
at a really nice wide operating

292
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,760
frequency from one megahertz to six

293
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,959
gigahertz

294
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,560
the price differences you'll see in

295
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
these basically gives you more

296
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,120
operating frequency now with that you

297
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,720
get to communicate with more things on

298
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,760
those channels

299
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,200
some of the cheaper ones the twenty

300
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,480
dollar twenty five dollars still

301
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
operated a very specific frequency so if

302
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,360
there's not

303
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,519
something talking in that range you

304
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,120
won't be able to communicate it with

305
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,440
it but the hack rf1 for example has a

306
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,800
really wide range so you can talk to the

307
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,480
garage door openers cars

308
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,200
whatever in this example we are

309
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,120
targeting a tire pressure monitoring

310
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,839
sensor

311
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,560
and that is the little sensor that's in

312
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,519
your wheel

313
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,880
that will detect if it's beyond the

314
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,839
recommended tire pressure sense so if

315
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:16,240
it's

316
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,519
higher or lower you get a little alert

317
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,839
on your dashboard

318
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,320
now i was doing some research on this

319
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,560
particular

320
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,040
product or you know whatever for a

321
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,320
vehicle before this talk and i hadn't

322
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,680
seen anything new so i think they

323
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,279
scrapped it all together

324
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,760
but at the point in time when we were

325
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,640
testing this

326
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,320
it was a self-inflating tire system the

327
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,920
way it worked was there was four sensors

328
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,959
in the tires

329
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,800
a central control unit that received the

330
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,560
messages from the tires that then talked

331
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,000
to an automatic control unit would

332
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,600
inflate or deflate the tire based on

333
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,320
need

334
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,839
now this picture is just an example it's

335
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,440
not what we're actually testing

336
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,959
but the applications for this were

337
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,040
military commercial and heavy machinery

338
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,640
so imagine you're in a battlefield

339
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
situation you don't want to get out of

340
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,800
the car

341
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,320
and pump a tire or change tire if you

342
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,000
have a flat or if it's you know

343
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,200
over inflated so they had this

344
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,959
you know the system that would inflate a

345
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,880
deflate based on need

346
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,399
so we're testing it with the software

347
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,040
defined radio and we were able to

348
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,120
you know capture the communications from

349
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,399
the tire pressure sensors that were

350
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,399
going to the central control unit

351
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,240
we were able to spoof those and trick

352
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,839
the tire pressure

353
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,440
control unit into thinking the tires

354
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,600
were under inflated or over inflated

355
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,079
so think about the implications for that

356
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,000
in a battlefield or in some heavy

357
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,120
machinery so

358
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,640
we trick the tire into thinking it's

359
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,480
under inflated it just keeps getting

360
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,160
pumped up until it explodes so if you're

361
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,120
in a battlefield

362
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,240
it's the last thing you want which is

363
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,440
why they probably scrapped this

364
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,399
technology

365
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,839
because i hope they did or figured out a

366
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,519
better way to protect it

367
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,600
and all that was done with a

368
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,519
software-defined radio and a computer

369
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,560
so not a lot of specialized equipment

370
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,240
next we're going to talk about the can

371
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,399
bus can't talk about cars without

372
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,600
talking about the canvas

373
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,240
so in a traditional it network you're

374
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,680
thinking you know cat wiring and things

375
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,399
like that

376
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,800
in a vehicle everything is you know a

377
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,160
canvas the ecu's which are the

378
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,760
electronic control units are basically

379
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,519
little computers that control various

380
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,360
functions of the vehicle

381
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,240
the easy there's various networks in the

382
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,040
vehicle there's

383
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,880
besides the can there's land flex-ray

384
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,800
most the easiest to interface with at

385
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,399
least in my opinion is the can bus

386
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,680
because you could talk to it through the

387
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,600
onboard diagnostics port which i'll show

388
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
you that in a moment

389
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,639
but this is one of those things i

390
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,240
thought was just going to be super

391
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,720
expensive i'd never be able to do it

392
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,920
because when you take a car for an

393
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,440
emissions check or for maintenance they

394
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,959
plug it into this super

395
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,399
huge machine that's got to cost

396
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,000
thousands of dollars

397
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,200
when i first got into this i didn't

398
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,800
think it would be a realistic thing to

399
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,440
do in my

400
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,600
my own time and then i found things like

401
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
the canon tank for 75 dollars i

402
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,399
personally use

403
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,480
canalize for 60 dollars there's the

404
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,800
cannibal here that's 80

405
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,200
and what this does is connects into the

406
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,800
odb port in your car

407
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,200
which can be found above the footrest

408
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,000
and

409
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,839
it's always accessible because it's used

410
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,120
for diagnostics so it's not going to be

411
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,399
any screws or anything holding it in

412
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,040
place

413
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,120
it may not be as easy to see as this

414
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,720
picture here but it's always

415
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,399
going to be on the driver's side

416
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,320
somewhere on the dash

417
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,360
and this device will plug into that and

418
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,120
then it has a usb adapter that plugs

419
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
into a computer

420
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,720
now things like wireshark have native

421
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,000
can

422
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,839
you know support there's other tools

423
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,600
like can utils that have canned dump and

424
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,120
can send so you can send packets and

425
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,519
capture packets

426
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,120
if you want to play with this more again

427
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,560
pop into the auto village

428
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,040
those guys have various components in

429
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,639
there right now that will let you play

430
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,399
with cam messages you can replay them

431
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,720
spoof them and try to figure them out

432
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,519
now with cam messages they're not

433
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,639
straightforward

434
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,160
there's not a standard used across all

435
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,600
the oems so they're not going to be able

436
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,959
to find a cheat sheet to see what things

437
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,360
mean

438
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,880
when you first plug into it and start

439
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,480
capturing the data

440
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,600
it looks crazy it comes in super fast

441
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,360
nothing's very clear like the ids are

442
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,480
all over the place you don't really know

443
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,639
what the messages are saying

444
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,800
but if you want to play with it you know

445
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,720
you could do it in your own car

446
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,120
plug in and then do things like turn on

447
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,959
the the winch wipers or you know

448
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,480
do your turn signal or put the car you

449
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,519
know push the brake or push the

450
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,320
accelerator

451
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,839
and just keep doing that over and over

452
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,600
and you'll start to see the same frames

453
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,120
over and over again so then you capture

454
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,000
those

455
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
you can replay them you can put them

456
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,680
into a loop and just blast them in there

457
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,880
and then it'll start to do things to

458
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,639
your car and you can identify

459
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,519
which message is doing what now through

460
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,399
the can bus

461
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,360
and the odb port specifically you can do

462
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,399
a lot of things you can unlock and

463
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,000
change features so like in my car

464
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
for example i could change you know what

465
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
the key press does on the

466
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,800
on the keys in the picture before was

467
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,320
from an audi forum where a guy was

468
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,240
flashing an ecu to do

469
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,240
a turbo boost unlock you can do actions

470
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,760
such as triggering the airbags the

471
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,279
brakes for the acceleration and when we

472
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,720
were doing automotive pen tests that's

473
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
the type of stuff we were looking for

474
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,480
could you communicate with something

475
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,560
through the can bus to

476
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,000
trigger the air bags to pop because

477
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,160
ultimately safety is the most important

478
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,519
thing in a vehicle

479
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,160
and if you could impact safety through

480
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,880
something is

481
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,040
like the can bus then it's a major

482
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,399
problem

483
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,600
so one of the other disclaimers i'll

484
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
throw out here is

485
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,959
playing with your vehicle and ecu's

486
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,480
could lead to potential damage

487
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,399
long-term i've never done it personally

488
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,680
i've never broken anything in my car

489
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,720
playing around

490
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,560
but i have seen horror stories where

491
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,160
people have braked ecu's they've had to

492
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,880
like tow their car

493
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,399
with dealership to get it flashed and

494
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,079
that's cost money

495
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,240
so you know proceed with caution there

496
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,000
is a lot of techniques now and tools

497
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,440
where you can virtualize these

498
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,360
you could buy ecu's off of ebay for 40

499
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,839
50 there's a resource i reference

500
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,600
at the end of this talk that shows you

501
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,440
how to set that up throw some 12 volt

502
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,639
power on it so you can have it on your

503
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,360
test bench and

504
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,959
i actually playing with the car and then

505
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,320
there's other great places again like

506
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,839
the auto hacking village and

507
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,519
you know forums and groups like that

508
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,839
where you can play online and not

509
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,800
actually do any damage

510
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,839
next is the infotainment system

511
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,519
so when i guess the last few vehicles i

512
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,120
had didn't have an infotainment system

513
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
and when i finally got one i'm looking

514
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,920
at it i'm like well how do i interface

515
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,560
with this thing

516
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,880
it's seamlessly integrated into the

517
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,720
dashboard there's got no ports on it

518
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,360
like what am i supposed to do

519
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,720
to play with this you don't really need

520
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,480
anything besides a computer

521
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
and if you want to figure out how to get

522
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,639
it apart look up a youtube video or

523
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,199
google

524
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,360
how do i replace my infotainment unit

525
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,040
and you'll see things like

526
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,880
step-by-step guides so in this

527
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,120
particular vehicle we were testing

528
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,720
it just showed these two little yellow

529
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,800
clips that held this piece of plastic in

530
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,279
place

531
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,639
so you just put a little force and pull

532
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,560
it off and it came right off

533
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,480
nothing broke and now we have the

534
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,160
infotainment unit exposed to us and it's

535
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,440
held in by these two screws

536
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,839
on each side so what do you do when you

537
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,040
have this device

538
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,519
well you pull it out and it's basically

539
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,040
just like a little computer it's in a

540
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,680
chassis

541
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,079
it's got screws and everything else and

542
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,120
what do you do with the computer when

543
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,240
you want to play with it you take it

544
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,720
apart

545
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,199
so pro tip keep a jar or a little

546
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,720
magnetized pad there so you don't lose

547
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,600
the screws

548
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,040
every time i take something apart

549
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,480
there's always extra screws when i put

550
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,519
it back together

551
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,079
don't know where those come from but you

552
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,199
know

553
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,959
once you take it apart you'll start to

554
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,880
see things on there that you might

555
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,119
be familiar with such as an sd card

556
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,079
reader

557
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,919
and once we found that we pop the sd

558
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,199
card out

559
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,199
put it into a laptop and what did we

560
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,119
find is a linux file system that was

561
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,319
readable and writable

562
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,839
so once we mounted it and started

563
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,359
playing around we found all these

564
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,160
binaries

565
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,039
that had vulnerabilities or we could

566
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,679
decompile the code on and play with them

567
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,280
once we did that we just put it back in

568
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,200
the file system put it back in here put

569
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,160
this together

570
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,480
dropped it back into the vehicle boom we

571
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,400
owned all the applications on this thing

572
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,240
we had root access we could bypass

573
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,520
pay walls that the automotive

574
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,919
manufacturer had through the store

575
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,520
so we could abuse features do some

576
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,440
monetary impact we weren't able to

577
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
communicate on the can bus

578
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,520
because of whatever limitations we ran

579
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,039
into through the test

580
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,760
but you can do a lot without any

581
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,360
specialized tools when it comes to the

582
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,080
infotainment system

583
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,520
next we'll look at wireless so

584
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,039
anybody who's done a wireless test in

585
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,720
the past will

586
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,320
be familiar with these devices elf is

587
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,679
probably one of the most prevalent

588
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,280
there's also the tp link there which is

589
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,400
only 15

590
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,080
anything that does packet injection you

591
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,320
can do a wireless test with

592
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,960
so in this particular example we were

593
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,600
testing

594
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,919
a handful of vehicles so there were

595
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,280
simultaneous tests going on there's

596
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,799
destructive testing of a team tearing

597
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,440
down an

598
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,080
infotainment unit we were doing wireless

599
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,960
assessments

600
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,240
people were just looking over the whole

601
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,640
vehicle while we were testing

602
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,960
we observed that the infotainment unit

603
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,080
was beaconing

604
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,360
for this access point it wasn't ours so

605
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,039
we used the wireless

606
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,080
usb dongle use host apd to use that

607
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,039
access point name

608
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,559
and as soon as we set it up the vehicle

609
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,960
connected no username or password

610
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,120
once that happened we did a port scan we

611
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,720
observed 422 is there

612
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,320
we tried things like root route route

613
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,080
admin eventually guested on like the

614
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,520
fifth or sixth try

615
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,400
and we had root access to this device so

616
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,280
while we're doing that

617
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,600
the team doing the destructive testing

618
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,440
was checking out the data sheets

619
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,120
realized the chip used in the

620
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,280
infotainment unit ivi is in vehicle

621
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,400
infotainment

622
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
allowed for ad hoc mode and that was

623
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,520
disabled via software

624
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,320
so we got thinking let's enable that and

625
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,360
we did

626
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,799
use the same access point name that the

627
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,720
car initially connected to

628
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,960
and then the car was acting as an access

629
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,400
point now all the other vehicles that we

630
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,160
were testing connected to it

631
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,280
with that idea we decided to push some

632
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,039
out of the vehicle so we did and then it

633
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,799
propagated the other vehicles

634
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,520
so we actually created this wormable

635
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,240
exploit

636
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,280
that connected all the vehicles and if

637
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,480
you think about it

638
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
again this goes back to you know

639
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,760
thinking that you're not going to be

640
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,720
smart enough or

641
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,320
you know have enough skill to test the

642
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,000
vehicle all of these are

643
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,400
basic security best practices wipe the

644
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,840
infotainment unit before it leaves the

645
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,640
factory

646
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,880
use a strong root password all this

647
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,000
could have been prevented

648
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,679
but it wasn't and it's just basic

649
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,760
security missteps that allowed us to

650
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,440
take over this this fleet of vehicles

651
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,760
so to summarize none of that was very

652
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,960
expensive was it i think the most

653
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,720
expensive thing is the hack rf1 and it's

654
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,000
320

655
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,679
everything else can be had for less than

656
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,280
a hundred dollars

657
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,679
and you can do whatever you want with it

658
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,400
so

659
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,280
again pop into the auto hacking village

660
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,480
play around

661
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,080
don't ever feel like you're not smart

662
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,600
enough you don't know enough to do it

663
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,000
we all start somewhere i still don't

664
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,640
think i know anything about this stuff

665
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,080
but you just jump in and start poking

666
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,840
around that's how you learn you try new

667
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,400
things

668
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,600
so let's switch gears my other

669
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,640
passion of mine growing plants i love

670
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,280
plants

671
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,039
when the pandemic hit we would go to the

672
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,559
store to buy food

673
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,240
nothing was available so i was like okay

674
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,440
we're really gonna have to kick this

675
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,320
into gear

676
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,840
we're gonna need to learn how to make

677
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,919
bread everything in between

678
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,440
so this picture here you'll see a banana

679
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,280
tree and an orange tree

680
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,320
which aren't native to cleveland so i do

681
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,520
enjoy growing plants

682
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,080
but it was really tricky in cleveland i

683
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,280
don't know if you've ever been there

684
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,960
you're from there but the weather is

685
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,400
really unpredictable you could have

686
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,320
three months of no sunshine it could be

687
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,480
freezing in the middle of summer growing

688
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,360
outdoors wasn't really

689
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,760
tenable so i moved it all indoors as you

690
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,880
can see in this picture these are a

691
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
bunch of tomato plants and a banana tree

692
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,200
in my closet and they don't look like

693
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,720
they're doing very well do they

694
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,400
the tomato plants got really tall and

695
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,159
fell over i was like there's got to be

696
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,559
something easier than this

697
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,400
great enter aeroponics so aeroponics is

698
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,640
a version of hydroponics

699
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,520
in which there's a container that holds

700
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,400
plants

701
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,159
in these pots that allow the roots to be

702
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,799
exposed to a constantly spring mist

703
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,559
and in aeroponics there's two types

704
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,880
there's low pressure and high pressure

705
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,320
and what we're going to be talking about

706
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,600
is low pressure

707
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,559
where it's a 24 hour spray of mist for

708
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,000
these roots

709
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,919
now once i found out about this i was

710
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,760
like i gotta get one of these things

711
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,880
let's let's go buy one but for 940

712
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,559
like that's crazy look at this thing

713
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,880
like it can't possibly cost that much

714
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,679
right

715
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,400
right so let's show you how i put one of

716
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,120
these together

717
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,159
for pretty cheap so first you're going

718
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,080
to need some pvc pipes and connectors

719
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,000
you can go to any home improvement store

720
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,760
your lows home depots menards whatever

721
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,120
you have available

722
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,240
10 feet of half inch diameter pipe is

723
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,600
2.40 cents i used less than twenty feet

724
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,760
plus the the elbows the t connectors and

725
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,799
the ends

726
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,640
it all came to about less than ten

727
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,240
dollars

728
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,159
next you're gonna need sprayer nozzles

729
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,240
like i mentioned with aeroponics

730
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,159
you wanna create this fine mist so these

731
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,840
nozzles go into the pvc pipe and the

732
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,600
water pressure goes through and it's

733
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
forced through these nozzles and creates

734
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,960
this fine mist

735
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,520
so 40 of these is six dollars on amazon

736
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,600
and if you'll notice it says 360 degrees

737
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,640
so they make these

738
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,080
in 270 and 180 they do a really targeted

739
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,799
spray but

740
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,880
in the aeroponic system you want a full

741
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,039
360 degrees because

742
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,559
the roots get wild and you want to make

743
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,760
sure they're all being sprayed because

744
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,480
dry roots are bad

745
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,080
next you're going to need a submersible

746
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,000
water pump and it has to be submersible

747
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,960
because it's going to be

748
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,919
in this water solution all the time so

749
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,280
if you get a dry pump it's not going to

750
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:15,919
work

751
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,360
this is something else you can find at

752
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,039
your loans or home depots

753
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,400
you typically find it in like the

754
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,840
outdoor gardening you'll see in koi

755
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,760
ponds or waterfall features

756
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,159
you can get this one on amazon for 24

757
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,120
and it does

758
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,440
400 gallons per hour you may not know

759
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,799
how many gallons per hour you're going

760
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,440
to need

761
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
it depends on how much piping and how

762
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,720
far away your water tank is from the

763
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,520
plants

764
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,440
but 400 worked for me and it comes with

765
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,720
all the features and the connections

766
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,200
that you need

767
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,400
next you're going to need something to

768
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,159
hold the plants so you see here this one

769
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,440
is 18

770
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,720
and it'll work just fine but i opted for

771
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,400
this actual plant table for a hundred

772
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,840
dollars from botanicare

773
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,919
it's three feet by three feet it's a lot

774
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,400
sturdier than this flimsy black plastic

775
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,760
and it's got really good irrigation

776
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,919
channels as you can see here

777
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,440
now pro tip again i wouldn't use this

778
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,919
had i've done this again my initial

779
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,559
build

780
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,440
was a flood drain table so the plants

781
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,799
sit on the table

782
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,240
and the water would flood it for 10

783
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,559
minutes every hour and then it drains

784
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,279
now when i did this i didn't realize how

785
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,480
big of an impact

786
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,080
the light hitting the plants and the

787
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,520
medium holding the plants would be and

788
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,279
it turned into an lg nightmare

789
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,480
to the point where i couldn't even clean

790
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,320
i had to throw everything away but i

791
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,360
didn't want to buy anything else because

792
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,080
i'm cheap

793
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,400
and i made it work and the next slides

794
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,840
will show how i made that work

795
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,960
but if you're going to build this

796
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,559
something like this would work and you

797
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,919
just cut holes in that and drop the

798
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,320
plants in there

799
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,279
so the net pots so you know your typical

800
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,120
garden plant that you buy from the store

801
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,720
it has a little plastic container that

802
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,679
the

803
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,279
plant sits in it's got a couple holes in

804
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,880
the bottom for drainage

805
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,640
and an aeroponic system you want

806
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
something that's like this with lots of

807
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,480
slides and a bunch of holes

808
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,919
you can get 50 of these for 10 on amazon

809
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,919
and why you want it like this is so the

810
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,679
roots get exposed to the mist

811
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,360
and they can just grow through it freely

812
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,720
next you're going to need a medium for

813
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,520
the pots so i chose clay pebbles which

814
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,000
are basically just little clay rocks

815
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,120
this 10 liter bag is 15 and 10 liters

816
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,200
translates to like 40 pounds so this is

817
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,039
gonna last me the rest of my life

818
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,120
if you go this route use clay rocks

819
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,320
rinse them before you use them because

820
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,679
they're really dusty and that's bad for

821
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,559
water

822
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,880
so just you know get enough for the pots

823
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,320
as you can see here they just sit in

824
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:32,799
there

825
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,080
this is what the roots look like i'll

826
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,039
show you another picture that in a

827
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:35,919
moment

828
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,440
but rinse them off and then you're good

829
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,919
to go with that

830
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,400
next is something to hold the pots in

831
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,559
place and the black light from

832
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,000
you know the water solution everything

833
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,919
like that we're all familiar with

834
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:48,559
cardboard

835
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,159
they make corrugated plastic which is

836
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,520
essentially the same thing it's got the

837
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,880
little ribs between

838
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,799
it's waterproof it didn't grow mold and

839
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,080
it was easy to cut

840
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,679
and i also bought a little circle cutter

841
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,240
from the same you know home depot lowe's

842
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,039
whatever

843
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,240
it puts a little hole in the center with

844
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,840
the razor blade it spins around so i

845
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,760
could cut the circle for the net pots

846
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,520
so this thing's less than 25 bucks for

847
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,159
the cardboard or the corrugated plastic

848
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,640
this is a big sheet it's what four feet

849
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,520
by i don't even know

850
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,320
96 inches and six feet and i cut it down

851
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,760
to three by three and i had some

852
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,200
left over for whatever else i needed for

853
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,880
next you're going to need a container

854
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,640
for your water solution

855
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,000
one of the things that appealed to me

856
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,679
about hydroponics aeroponics

857
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,039
is that it's kind of low maintenance

858
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,840
and once you get this all set up this

859
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,480
thing will hold

860
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
20 gallons of water so you don't really

861
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,919
need to water it often you just come

862
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,200
down and check to make sure the water

863
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,640
level is higher than the pump

864
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,880
because you don't want it to burn out

865
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,840
and it's pretty much

866
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,480
set it and forget it from there and

867
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,919
finally you're going to need a light

868
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,320
so the pictures you saw earlier i was

869
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,840
using a high pressure sodium light

870
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,080
when i first got into this hobby led

871
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,200
lights weren't a thing

872
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
but now that they are this is absolutely

873
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,799
the way to go 500 watt

874
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,320
is 50 1000 watts 90 i think i paid like

875
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,480
400 dollars for high pressure sodium for

876
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,960
400 watt but it's a tank and it's lasted

877
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
20 years so when it finally dies

878
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,480
i'll replace it with this but this is

879
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,520
absolutely the way to go now

880
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,080
now let's put that all together remember

881
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,320
the pre-made system for 940 bucks

882
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,279
ridiculous this entire homemade system

883
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,320
with a light

884
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,399
is 250 and you're done

885
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,240
now the only thing that doesn't factor

886
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,159
in here is the time it takes to put it

887
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,679
all together

888
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,679
and i apologize i didn't realize i'd be

889
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,960
doing a talk on this or i would have

890
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,279
taken more pictures of the build process

891
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,600
but let's go through what we have here

892
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,200
so you take your

893
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,480
container that's going to hold the

894
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,159
plants that the sprayer will be in you

895
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:46,720
measure it

896
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,640
you get the pvc pipes and you cut them

897
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,159
and it's like playing leaky pipes on a

898
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,080
windows system back in the day

899
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,760
you put it together doesn't look right

900
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,200
pull it apart try it again

901
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,720
it's like oh this t goes here this end

902
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,120
cap goes here you figure it out

903
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
boom done next you're gonna need the

904
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,720
sprayer nozzles in so you just get a

905
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,600
little drill

906
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,279
drill a hole pop those in whoops

907
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,600
there we are there we go and then if you

908
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,720
can see around here

909
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,159
i use a pure silicone caulk and just to

910
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,200
keep you know seal the gaps so i don't

911
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,559
want any water leaking out of there i

912
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,480
want it all coming out of the nozzle

913
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
and then this is it all put together so

914
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,760
you see the corrugated plastic

915
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,080
the neck cups the rock cube or the rock

916
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,919
or clay pebbles

917
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,440
and i put little pvc pipes in here

918
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,960
to support it because i started to sag a

919
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,120
bit

920
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,159
and now you're basically done so sit

921
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:38,640
back

922
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,039
and watch your hard work come to life so

923
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,640
after a few days you start to get some

924
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,440
sprouts

925
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,279
you could start the seeds in you know

926
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,640
white paper towel or something like that

927
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,480
if you want to just drop seedlings in

928
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,840
or if you just want to put seeds into

929
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,120
the neck cups that works too

930
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,080
so feed and pollinate those are key

931
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,600
things to growing plants

932
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,799
so when you're doing this you don't need

933
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,600
plant food

934
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,440
but the difference between using plant

935
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,880
food and not is

936
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,039
night and day your plants will be

937
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:07,919
humongous

938
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,360
the more fruit bigger fruit if you use

939
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,399
plant food

940
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,960
now it's important to use a hydroponic

941
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,440
based

942
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,279
or a food made for hydroponics you don't

943
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,320
want to use something that's made for

944
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,600
soil because

945
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,760
it may not be as water soluble it'll

946
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,200
clog your sprayer and your pump

947
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,480
and that's just a nightmare you don't

948
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,559
want to deal with

949
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,320
now the other thing with aeroponics and

950
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,159
hydroponics is the soilless growing

951
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:30,960
system

952
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,120
so there's nothing absorbing any of the

953
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,720
nutrients it's all going straight to the

954
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,080
plants and you'll see that here in a

955
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,360
second

956
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,080
so this is you know week one i think i

957
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,600
think this is week two or three

958
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,760
and just see how big these things are

959
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,200
getting so if you see here

960
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,600
each one's next to each other and i

961
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,399
didn't plan

962
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,880
for how big they were going to get so in

963
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,679
the next picture

964
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,399
i had to you know weed out the ones that

965
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,679
weren't doing too well

966
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,799
and when you're growing plants you'll

967
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,000
notice that some are doing better than

968
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,520
others you just get rid of the ones that

969
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,240
aren't doing well

970
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,720
to make space for your healthy ones now

971
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,760
i don't know if anybody's ever grown

972
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,679
peppers before

973
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,080
but these things got massive in this

974
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,760
aeroponics solution so like a typical

975
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,399
pepper leaf

976
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,840
when you're growing on outside is like

977
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,679
as big as your hand these things were

978
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,200
like two dinner plates like i was

979
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,320
cutting them off and showing people

980
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,960
because it was just so impressive

981
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,240
now when you're growing these the canopy

982
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,480
will get really dense and the leaves

983
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,240
below will start to die off

984
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,159
it's important to cut back on those

985
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,279
because you don't want the plant to

986
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,880
focus any additional energy trying to

987
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,159
keep those alive

988
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,080
you want it to spend its energy on

989
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,080
growing the healthy leaves and foliage

990
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,000
and putting all the energy into fruiting

991
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,360
and the vegetables

992
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,320
and i'll show you a picture of that

993
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,720
later too

994
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,559
so you remember this picture the tomato

995
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,840
plants they got

996
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,080
five six feet tall i never saw a single

997
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,799
tomato and i couldn't figure out why

998
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,480
i didn't realize how important bees were

999
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,799
and i didn't want to bring a bunch of

1000
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,760
bees into my house

1001
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,559
so easy solution five dollar electric

1002
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,000
toothbrush

1003
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,559
once your plant starts to flower this is

1004
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,440
a green pepper

1005
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,039
it grows these little flowers with

1006
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,640
little pollen sacks and

1007
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,080
in nature bees birds all those creatures

1008
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,159
take that pollen and spread it around in

1009
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,240
your house you don't have that luxury

1010
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,519
i didn't know that and an easy solution

1011
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,840
was a five dollar electric toothbrush

1012
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,240
once your plant starts to pollinate you

1013
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,600
just take the electric toothbrush turn

1014
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,080
it on

1015
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,000
hold it next to the stem over here

1016
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,679
shakes the polymers from these flowers

1017
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,840
it pollinates the other ones and now you

1018
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,200
have fruiting plants

1019
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,720
this is what happy and healthy roots

1020
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,039
look like in an aeroponic solution

1021
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,480
so this is the underside of the

1022
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,320
corrugated cardboard in that pots

1023
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,720
the roots just won't run wild underneath

1024
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,760
there like it looks like

1025
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,720
a tangled mess it's insane but these all

1026
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,200
hang

1027
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,960
and the solution just sprays constantly

1028
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,840
around there there's nothing stopping me

1029
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,760
you know interfering with the absorption

1030
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,120
of the nutrients and everything it's

1031
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,760
just straight

1032
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,200
roots and water nutrients

1033
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,640
now that you've fed pollinated all that

1034
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,360
you start to get your fruit so this i

1035
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,600
don't remember exactly the timeline here

1036
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:07,919
i

1037
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,240
should have chronicled it better but i

1038
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,279
think the life cycle on the green

1039
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,080
peppers was

1040
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,039
you know 60 to 90 days to maturation

1041
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,880
another thing i didn't realize was green

1042
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,399
peppers red peppers and yellow peppers

1043
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,760
all come from the same pepper

1044
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,600
so i was saving seeds from green peppers

1045
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,960
and red peppers i was buying at the

1046
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,000
store and planting them

1047
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,039
and they're all green and i couldn't

1048
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,200
figure out why yeah go figure

1049
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,880
they just leave them on the plant longer

1050
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,640
and they mature and sweeten and they

1051
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,399
turn red and yellow

1052
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,320
but you can see here they're starting to

1053
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,799
grow and they're looking healthy

1054
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,600
the plants will continue to flower all

1055
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,120
the time so if you see here like there's

1056
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,240
little trimmed roots

1057
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,480
there are trim branches and stems and

1058
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,279
like i mentioned

1059
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,600
once the canopy gets really dense the

1060
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,960
leaves start fighting for light and

1061
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,799
they'll start crowding each other out

1062
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,399
just want to trim those back so the

1063
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,240
plant is focusing on the healthy

1064
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,919
leaves and putting all this energy into

1065
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,480
growing the vegetables

1066
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,320
now after they look ripe and you're

1067
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,000
happy with them

1068
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,240
you can enjoy so you just pull them off

1069
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,279
add them to your food

1070
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,320
and you're off to the races so in

1071
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,039
summary

1072
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,799
back to this picture of me in a hot dog

1073
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,159
costume in china

1074
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,240
laying on top of the test vehicle in the

1075
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,320
automotive hacking village

1076
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,919
information security has taken me all

1077
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,360
over the world i've been to china

1078
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,080
england you know poland germany

1079
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,679
everywhere in between

1080
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,559
all because it's a highly in demand

1081
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,200
field

1082
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,159
and your skills are appreciated get out

1083
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,279
of your own head if you don't think

1084
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,080
you're good enough

1085
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,200
i still don't think i'm good enough but

1086
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,320
that doesn't stop me from getting in

1087
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,360
there and trying

1088
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,720
there's plenty of people that would love

1089
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,559
to help it doesn't matter where you're

1090
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,720
starting from or what your background is

1091
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,640
all you have to do is put in a little

1092
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,960
effort a little dedication

1093
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,799
and try that's that's where we all

1094
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,399
started you start poking around

1095
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,239
and it'll take you places

1096
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,919
finally some references and i'll leave

1097
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,120
this slide up for a moment for anybody

1098
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,519
who wants to uh take a screen cap

1099
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,519
but car hacking for pory's charlie

1100
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,279
miller and chris valesik they're

1101
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,559
great they're the ones that did the

1102
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,320
g-pack a few years ago

1103
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,639
but car hiking for poury's teaches you

1104
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,159
how to buy an ecu

1105
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,480
for cheap set it up on a 12-volt power

1106
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,679
supply on a workbench so you're not

1107
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,280
testing an actual car

1108
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,199
and you can poke around there's other

1109
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,719
resource sources out there that will

1110
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,000
show you how to virtualize it so you're

1111
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,918
not messing with the actual car

1112
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,599
you can virtualize infotainment units

1113
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,199
now you can download

1114
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,960
you know images for those things and

1115
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,480
play with them in a

1116
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,839
you know virtual box or something like

1117
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,719
that the relay text on passive keyless

1118
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,079
entry and start systems

1119
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,079
i think that's what gave us the

1120
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,359
blueprint for building our remote

1121
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,839
keyless entry system

1122
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,760
everything's out there already and like

1123
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,918
with anything hardware based

1124
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,399
it's kind of a test and discovery once

1125
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,320
the initial vulnerability or technique

1126
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,879
is found

1127
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,359
and put online all the hard work's done

1128
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,560
you just need to find it

1129
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,918
and put it together you don't need to do

1130
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,359
all the research yourself somebody else

1131
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,000
has done it

1132
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,560
and you just need to put it together as

1133
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,079
for the crops

1134
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,599
i didn't use any of these resources when

1135
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,119
i built mine i'll admit i actually

1136
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,480
purchased one of those solutions in the

1137
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,560
past it was a little four by four once i

1138
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,680
didn't spend a fortune

1139
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
but it was still kind of expensive i

1140
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,040
realized how it worked

1141
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,119
and then i put a bigger one together but

1142
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,040
i did a little research on these before

1143
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,680
this talk

1144
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,359
just to make sure that these would be

1145
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,359
good to provide some guidance

1146
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,160
and these all had really good you know

1147
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,800
plans

1148
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,960
and explanations as to what you're doing

1149
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,119
and how to build it

1150
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,880
now with that being said any questions

1151
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,560
awesome presentation griffin there are a

1152
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
couple so

1153
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,839
first one was are bugs like fruit flies

1154
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,280
and that's an issue with aeroponics

1155
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,079
no they i did actually have some flies

1156
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,359
there's some little fruit flies in the

1157
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,359
basement but i wasn't sure if it was

1158
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:51,760
from

1159
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,920
you know the liquor collection down

1160
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,040
there or what

1161
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,560
it wasn't a big problem because they

1162
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
would just land on top of the

1163
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,599
plastic and drown so it wasn't

1164
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,640
overwhelming i didn't really have any

1165
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,560
issues ever with that though

1166
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,400
okay great and do you have any best

1167
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,400
practices for trimming or pruning plants

1168
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,440
now just get some some spring-loaded

1169
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,480
clippers because

1170
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,079
you know the other ones are a little

1171
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,760
hard to deal with but

1172
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,520
if the doesn't look healthy or if the

1173
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,680
leaf's starting to wilt or turn brown

1174
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,800
you don't want the plant spending too

1175
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,480
much time on that so just clip it off in

1176
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:24,720
it

1177
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,160
you know i feel bad doing it because i

1178
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,839
don't want to hurt the plants i actually

1179
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,280
spent a lot of time with these things

1180
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,839
like

1181
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,359
i say it's really low maintenance and

1182
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,880
you can set it and forget it but i was

1183
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,400
down there all the time and i was just

1184
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,520
like sick because it's like

1185
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,760
fake sunlight and you're talking to them

1186
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,640
and you can actually

1187
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,480
see progress like every few hours

1188
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,000
they're bigger and bigger which is crazy

1189
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,960
to me

1190
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,920
so yeah you just you know care for them

1191
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,599
you're doing the best for them so you

1192
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,960
cut off the dead or dying

1193
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,839
dying leaves and branches and they get

1194
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,200
stronger

1195
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,640
question about let's see

1196
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,720
oh well someone commented and said you

1197
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,800
need more bees in your presentation so

1198
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,599
next time more

1199
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,760
more bees next time i'll do them in the

1200
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,640
house

1201
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,160
i was like what can i do with this like

1202
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,160
can i be classic that seems like a great

1203
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,680
idea

1204
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,520
um and where do the extra screws come

1205
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,280
from

1206
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,800
i think they're just hidden in the

1207
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,560
chassis somewhere and they fall out once

1208
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:20,960
you

1209
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,440
you take it apart the manufacturer's

1210
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,880
just messing with you

1211
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,240
to encourage you not to play with their

1212
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,240
stuff right right

1213
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,480
yeah um and then lastly i had a question

1214
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,079
for you and so

1215
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,720
for anyone i guess who might be for the

1216
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,440
younger

1217
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,079
folk um how far back would you have to

1218
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:38,960
go

1219
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,760
to get a car that isn't susceptible to

1220
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,640
the hacking that you showed today

1221
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,760
i mean i have a 2018

1222
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,240
and most of that stuff still works so

1223
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,520
not too far and like

1224
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,839
i i think i mentioned the my wife's

1225
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,280
friend's car being stolen hers was like

1226
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:55,520
a

1227
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,640
2020 and that

1228
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,160
relay technique still works so you know

1229
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,440
more the higher end manufacturers

1230
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,079
started to put like the rolling crypto

1231
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,359
keys and things like that into it and

1232
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,880
like time-based responses

1233
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,079
but some of the other ones just still

1234
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,560
don't care or it's too expensive to go

1235
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,000
retrofit into all of these existing cars

1236
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,839
do you have any recommendations for some

1237
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,440
pee caps with canned

1238
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
traffic for playing around i would talk

1239
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,800
to the auto hacking guys

1240
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,280
they probably have better answers for

1241
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,320
that than me

1242
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,000
most of mine came from just trial and

1243
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,079
error i would connect my car

1244
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,240
and start playing with things like i

1245
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,599
pushed the gas pedal down and

1246
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,960
like it would flood you know can traffic

1247
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,800
when i did that with certain ids so i

1248
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
knew that had something to do with it so

1249
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,119
i'd get those you know trim out the ones

1250
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,560
that weren't related to that and replay

1251
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,160
them and see what it did so

1252
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,359
it's kind of trial and error you know

1253
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,040
you just play around and see what works

1254
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,880
and what doesn't and

1255
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,520
make sure your vehicle is in park right

1256
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,880
okay and then have you made anything

1257
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,400
delicious out of your own plants

1258
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,560
yeah i use peppers all the time so

1259
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,640
nothing super delicious it's just

1260
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,320
saves me a trip to the grocery store and

1261
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,560
it's it's nice being able to enjoy the

1262
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,520
fruits of your labor

1263
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,720
you know no pun intended vegetables yeah

1264
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
it's awesome like the banana tree i've

1265
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,480
i've been to five or six banana trees

1266
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,320
i've never got them to the point where

1267
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,839
a banana will grow because it's like a

1268
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,599
five to seven year process

1269
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,640
but i'm really looking forward to that

1270
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,720
when it finally happens

1271
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,880
and you mentioned um i don't know if you

1272
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,480
started the aeroponic did you start the

1273
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,240
aeroponics in cleveland or

1274
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,839
in denver i did so i just moved to

1275
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,599
denver november i've been doing

1276
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,640
aeroponics for like 15 years now

1277
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,440
so so in so my question is does the air

1278
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,280
matter so now i know you're

1279
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,480
you're fit you know 52 88 feet above the

1280
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,040
ground

1281
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,040
does the air matter that's a good

1282
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,240
question i have no idea

1283
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,119
okay let us know the arrow comes from

1284
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,720
the aerosol

1285
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,160
i would assume spraying of the mist

1286
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,480
but i could be wrong i don't know right

1287
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,119
does it matter at higher elevations

1288
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,720
i've never tried on here yet like we're

1289
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,240
still settling so i haven't got the

1290
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,240
whole setup re

1291
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,800
you know built back but soon i'll

1292
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,200
everybody know next time

1293
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,000
all right awesome well thank you so much

1294
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,880
griffin

1295
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,319
uh this was a wonderful day i'll be

1296
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,839
honest if you have any other questions

1297
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,119
and uh i hope you enjoy

1298
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,839
thanks everyone
