today's topic is a little um

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,560
hodgepodge of things but it's

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,160
interesting these are two

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,920
fields of um expertise that i really

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,960
enjoy and i really like doing you know

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,960
one of them is fishing

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,840
i i'm a social engineer i'm a pen tester

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,519
i do a lot of things fishing is

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,239
one of the things that's an art and with

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:34,880
that

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,840
carry catcher is another art form that i

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,600
heavily enjoy

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,800
practicing in my spare time so i'll be

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,480
going through both of them and

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,079
connecting the two together

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,440
first and foremost my profession

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,719
what do i do how do i do it

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,160
i'll take you through some of the

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,719
fishing life cycles that i go through

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,359
and then in a similar scenario i'll

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,480
dissect some of the

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,559
the process the workflow that a

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,600
caricature

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,680
requires a little bit about me for those

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,439
of you who don't know me

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,119

hacker

32

i do a lot of pen testing i do a lot of

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,840
advisory work on the left you see all my

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,479
official titles on the right is what my

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,560
friends and family members often refer

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400
to me as sometimes i wear

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,720
my tin foil hat when i talk about

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,680
privacy

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,960
i do a lot of ocean investigations

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,439
by heart i'm a network guy i'm a network

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,560
geek

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,280
i do coding as well so i'm a bit all

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,320
over the place i

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,479
i have this sort of passion for

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,320
technology

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,759
but to today what i'll go through

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,720
is a process of uh fishing now fishing

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,360
is not just sending out an email

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,240
and hoping for someone to click on it it

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,840
requires a lot of

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,560
process a lot of thinking through the

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,920
different elements

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,040
why people click what

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,919
influences them to click on a fish

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,080
what's a good fish versus a bad

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,879
fishing attempt so here are some of the

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,440
steps

58
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,319
for a successful phishing attack you

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,760
have to start off with

60
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,280
open source intelligence that that is

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,319
the heart of any attack whether it's a

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,879
pen test or a phishing attack

63
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,239
you have to do your research your

64
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,480
reconnaissance once you have enough

65
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,720
information about the target

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,120
that's when you start attack i should

67
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,040
pause her and preface this

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,319
i am contracted by companies to do a

69
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,360
phishing attack

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,239
it is uh not legal to just go around

71
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,640
fishing anyone for their credentials

72
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,200
we we do this professionally companies

73
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360
hire us sign a contract

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,879
to fish either a subset of their

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,720
employees or all of the employees

76
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,879
collect data statistics

77
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,959
who clicked how many people submitted

78
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,760
credentials how many people reported

79
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,519
it's all about education all about

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,599
making the process better

81
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,920
so it's it's weird because i have to win

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,680
in this i have to

83
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
make people click at the same time once

84
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,720
i'm done

85
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,800
i have to devise methods on how

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,040
not to click on a phishing attack how

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,400
this could have been prevented and

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,319
that's the advisory piece

89
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,120
of my job so start with open source

90
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
intelligence

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,519
formulate your social engineering plan

92
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,200
what are you gonna pretend to be

93
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
uh what what does your phishing email

94
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,040
look like uh

95
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,319
craft the phishing email

96
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,239
craft a landing page what happens when

97
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,319
they click on it what happens when they

98
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,000
submit their credentials where do they

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,560
get redirected if you don't think these

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,519
the things through um you could make

101
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,799
mistakes and then

102
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,000
it could end up looking like

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,080
a phishing attack you don't want it to

104
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,760
look like that you want it to look

105
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,080
legitimate you don't want any clues left

106
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,920
behind

107
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,319
for example if if in your research you

108
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,040
find out that the company uses

109
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,400
let's say ups as their carrier but

110
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,639
you send out a phishing email that says

111
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,839
fedex you have

112
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,160
a message from fedex no one's going to

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,918
fall for that or at least we hope

114
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,320
no one's going to fall for that but

115
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,680
that's not a good phishing attack

116
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,440
because you didn't do your

117
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,880
osint work up front then you have to

118
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,639
have a system of tracking these

119
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,680
statistics you have to have a system of

120
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,120
reporting

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,280
a method where people can report back

122
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,120
and say aha we caught this phishing

123
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,160
attack

124
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
how do you report on those things i'll

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,040
show you in the next slide

126
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,600
then comes the phase okay the fishing

127
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,560
attack is over

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,400
now you need to identify the gaps were

129
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
there technology gaps

130
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,960
did the fishing go through their their

131
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,000
spam filter

132
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,800
if not why why not how can you fix that

133
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,280
then

134
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,479
what about the the the human defenses

135
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,000
why did people fall for this

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,240
do they need more um educational

137
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,600
training videos

138
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,240
more scenarios more phishing simulations

139
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,440
you have to suggest

140
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,080
uh something to the client in a report

141
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,320
and then rinse and repeat

142
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,199
so i'm not a powerpoint guy i only have

143
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,400
a few

144
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,240
powerpoint slides here so i'll stop

145
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,600
right here and show you

146
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,840
the back end of what a phishing attack

147
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,400
really looks like

148
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,199
to start off with you need to set up a

149
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,560
bunch of servers

150
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,039
so i've said i've set up this on google

151
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:37,759
cloud

152
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,160
it's called gofish it's my phishing

153
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,520
server of choice

154
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,479
there are many out there this is free

155
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,680
open source

156
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,080
you have to set it up find unit i've

157
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,039
done that here

158
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,479
my server is running this is what the

159
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,600
server looks like i go to the go fish

160
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,520
dashboard and i see

161
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,720
[Music]

162
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,600
a bunch of statistics over here on

163
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
what's going on how many people clicked

164
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,160
email

165
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,639
sent and all these things these are

166
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,240
statistics from previous

167
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,120
attempts i can go in here and start

168
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,080
setting things up

169
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,240
but before i do that you need a second

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,400
server to get things running an

171
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,680
email server and you need a domain

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,440
so the domain name that i bought for

173
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,720
this example

174
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,400
is verification.com the verification

175
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,360
doesn't have an i

176
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,039
in there so it's verificating.com

177
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,160
but as we all know who really checks the

178
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,960
spellings

179
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,039
in an email in a bit i'll show you how

180
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,560
this really looks like

181
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,639
but this is how most phishing attacks

182
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,960
are done here my goal is not to spoof

183
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,479
an email spoofing is mimicking someone

184
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,319
else's corporate email address

185
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,360
that surely will get blocked i just i

186
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,880
don't even try that i just

187
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,360
buy a brand new one because people are

188
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,280
not looking at the domain

189
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,680
but nonetheless i this is my server for

190
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
my mail so this is the mail server

191
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,120
that's running

192
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,560
i don't use services for this because

193
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,880
most services like mail gun and

194
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,680
so many others they all get blocked so i

195
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,360
set up my own

196
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
this is what the mail server looks like

197
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
this is

198
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,759
mail in the box dot com

199
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,720
or similar and it's just showing me

200
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,800
simple statistics on the back end

201
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
once i have my two servers up and

202
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
running i

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,720
can start my attack so my attack starts

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,680
with

205
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,319
a campaign so let's look at some of my

206
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,919
email templates

207
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,240
first things first you have to formulate

208
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,319
a template let's just look at

209
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,199
one of my existing templates here so a

210
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,080
template would

211
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,680
be in html i would code it in html

212
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,960
i would look at how it views

213
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,599
i would send a bunch of test emails back

214
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,479
and forth

215
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,840
this is an amazon phishing email with

216
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,199
a 50 gift card in it and i can put

217
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,560
whatever i want here

218
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,120
and this would be how the email would be

219
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,560
sent

220
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
then you have landing pages and stuff

221
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,599
let me go through an actual process so

222
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,400
let's go

223
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,520
through a campaign a live campaign

224
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,960
hopefully this works let's copy this

225
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,919
so what i'll do is i'll start this

226
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,280
campaign you

227
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,000
name it something let's call it pancakes

228
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,120
con

229
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,759
to linkedin demo i have an email

230
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,120
template that i've created which you

231
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,760
will see

232
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,719
in a bit i have a landing page a

233
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,679
linkedin

234
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,159
fake linkedin page comes up this is the

235
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,919
url that comes up

236
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,320
so i can put anything before the main

237
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,800
domain that i like so since this is for

238
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,320
linkedin i'll put

239
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,959
linkedin.verification.com

240
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,080
because this is what they'll see when

241
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,399
they hover over it

242
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,240
i have a sending profile which is my

243
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,519
email profile

244
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,480
the email server that i set up all the

245
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,640
smtp details are in there

246
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,080
and i have groups so let's make a test

247
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,360
group here

248
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,160
i have a test group with a fake account

249
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,760
that i have

250
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,160
by the name of adam this is my stock

251
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,120
puppet account

252
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,160
so i'll send it to that and i do

253
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,240
launch campaign are you sure yes let's

254
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,040
launch it

255
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,680
so campaign has been launched ideally i

256
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,360
would put in here a couple of hundred

257
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,800
emails provided

258
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,000
by the client themselves and this would

259
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,120
now go out

260
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,600
since this is just one email now i start

261
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
seeing statistics in the back end

262
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,920
this is what i'm after i see one email

263
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,880
was sent

264
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,519
nobody opened it no one clicked it and

265
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,200
no one submitted any data

266
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,240
here are the details of that so

267
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,360
now let's go and check that email

268
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,320
did i really receive that email so here

269
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,640
is

270
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,760
mail.com this is where that person is so

271
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,880
i just got an email

272
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,320
linkedin security alert this is that

273
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,079
phishing email

274
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,320
now let's look at it real quick on the

275
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,240
surface it looks

276
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,800
fine hey adam you have successfully

277
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,959
turned on two-step verification

278
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,720
that's a good thing everyone should have

279
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,040
it turn on but if you haven't and you

280
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,240
get this message

281
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,040
it means someone else has so it raises a

282
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,160
few flags

283
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,880
at the same time it looks quite legit

284
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,399
everything's mimicked as

285
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,560
linkedin would send you there's no

286
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,839
spelling mistakes

287
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,000
hopefully not a copy pasted an actual

288
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,040
email

289
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,600
there's no alignment mistakes or

290
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,680
anything so this looks perfect

291
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,000
these things are edited out so that it

292
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
raises some alerts that

293
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,240
somebody who's using firefox linux from

294
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,079
moscow russia

295
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,120
and a date that's not accurate

296
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,560
these things should raise a few red

297
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,640
flags and the moment they click on

298
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,440
something

299
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,560
i hover over this and nothing kind of

300
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,240
comes up you can see in the bar

301
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,880
below a little link that says

302
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,279
linkedin.verification.com and

303
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,519
stuff like that it kind of looks legit

304
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,680
let's check who it's from

305
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,320
it's from linkedin security alert and

306
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,000
the email address is also

307
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,399
linkedin at verification.com kind of

308
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,640
looks legit it's not one of those dot

309
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,000
uh ru dot cn dot v whatever uh

310
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,959
weird looking domains so at first glance

311
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:23,920
it looks

312
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,959
quite legit i click on this and if this

313
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,480
was another mail server it would have

314
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:28,880
just

315
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,760
gone through mail.com redirects it first

316
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,120
so it's redirecting

317
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,160
and it came to my phishing page here now

318
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,560
before i yeah go ahead just one quick

319
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,320
second uh it looks like your screen

320
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,079
share may have paused for us

321
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,000
let me stop sharing and

322
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,800
reshare again

323
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,560
i've noticed sometimes that happens with

324
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,200
the zoom

325
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,000
yeah yeah but hey what's the conference

326
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,440
without a technical issue or two

327
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,360
let me know when you see it uh i

328
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,720
haven't seen it yet uh i'll have a look

329
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,000
and see if the chat sees it

330
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,839
nope nothing yet several people are

331
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,720
typing

332
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,279
[Laughter]

333
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,000
ah no it doesn't look like it's showing

334
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,320
on

335
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,519
their end uh

336
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:38,240
no we just see go fish not the email

337
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,440
when did it pause last

338
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,000
i think it was

339
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,519
it should come open a bit

340
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000

343
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,839

344
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,100

345
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,440
[Music]

346
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,399

all right so yeah let me go back just a

352
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,440
few

353
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,399
uh clicks so this was the go go fish

354
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,760
screen here

355
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,440
i received an email in the inbox which

356
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,399
was was right here i look at it quick

357
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,480
five second glance i click on it

358
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,639
when i click on it the landing page

359
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,600
comes up

360
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,720
now all of this is being hosted from go

361
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,120
fish

362
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,839
i see the bar up there

363
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,120
linkedin.verification

364
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,199
some random characters now before i

365
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,199
click through let's go back to

366
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,240
the go fish screen and it says email

367
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,959
open one

368
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,040
email clicked one so these are live

369
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,800
statistics being gathered

370
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,600
and if i refresh this it's fine so it

371
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,800
says

372
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,680
clicked from a windows machine using

373
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,639
firefox

374
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,120
i'm on a mac this is not windows but i

375
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,760
have

376
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,360
a user agent switcher here which says

377
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,079
mimic a windows machine with firefox

378
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,519
that's why it's showing this

379
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,440
i thought i'd demo that as well good

380
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,199
opsec is always

381
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,320
preferred so that's why this is showing

382
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,639
that

383
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,000
let's change that user agent to

384
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
default and let's go back

385
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,320
to this linkedin screen here

386
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,680
now i could enter in my actual password

387
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
here which is from my password manager

388
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,000
it's like

389
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,320
40 50 characters long and it would

390
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,199
redirect but

391
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,800
just for the heck of it let's enter

392
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,240
something random

393
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,440
so i'm entering a random password and i

394
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,199
click sign in

395
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,639
and i've basically been redirected to

396
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,560
the actual linkedin page now it says

397
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,800
linkedin.com and here's my

398
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,120
two-step verification page i look at it

399
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,320
everything looks right

400
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,160
and i'm actually signed in because i was

401
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,480
previously signed into this sock puppet

402
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:12,959
account

403
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,199
i can go back to the actual linkedin

404
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,279
page everything's fine

405
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,519
nothing really wrong i can continue with

406
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,880
my daily

407
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,920
life after this but if i look back here

408
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,320
and i refresh this it's already here it

409
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,600
says submitted data

410
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,639
one person submitted data i go back

411
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,560
remember i changed it from windows to

412
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,320
default now it says mac os

413
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,480
so i know my user agent switcher is

414
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,000
working

415
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,199
i look at the details i captured the

416
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,000
username

417
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,320
and i captured the password this is what

418
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,199
i just

419
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,480
entered in randomly and now

420
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,240
this is a full end to end phishing cycle

421
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,399
phishing basically stops at this point

422
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,360
once i

423
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,480
run this through for a week or so

424
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,120
everyone gets a chance to click it or or

425
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,600
not

426
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,240
or report it if someone reports an email

427
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,639
i can manually put that in here

428
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,839
these statistics this data goes

429
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,560
in the report the client gets to see

430
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,040
this

431
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,240
and then the remediation piece starts

432
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,160
we start resetting passwords of people

433
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,680
who actually submitted it

434
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
we get to see if the passwords were too

435
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,519
weak uh were they long enough

436
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,759
you know many different things could

437
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,279
come out of this education is

438
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,440
is the main thing here so those are the

439
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,639
things we want to

440
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,440
go over with our client and this is an

441
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,720
end to end

442
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,000
phishing life cycle

443
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,759
and and that's what i basically do this

444
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,720
is

445
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,639
this is fun this requires a lot of back

446
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,560
end work a lot of reconnaissance

447
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,600
where did i learn all of this my primary

448
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,279
resource the one thing i would

449
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,800
tell people who want to learn how to

450
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,120
fish write is

451
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,360
a book by chris haddnaggy fishing dark

452
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,160
waters

453
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,480
it goes through all the techniques you

454
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,759
know whether it's a

455
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,079
beginner phishing email intermediary

456
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,119
advanced

457
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,160
spare phishing or whaling type of emails

458
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,640
the tools the tricks of the trades

459
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
influence versus manipulation what are

460
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,079
we really doing here

461
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,079
this was more influence tactics because

462
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,240
nobody got offended nobody

463
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,799
felt manipulated with a gift card or

464
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,400
those type of things we just

465
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,599
got in got their credentials no one

466
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,960
noticed it

467
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,480
and we were out so i highly recommend

468
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,320
this book by christopher hadnaggy

469
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,919
fishing dark waters if you want to

470
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,000
really up your game on the fishing

471
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,120
arena that's what i had with this

472
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,840
now a lot of this is very stressful and

473
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,120
a lot of work

474
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,080
goes into this programming ocean pen

475
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,760
testing all these things

476
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,039
in my spare time i like to draw i like

477
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,400
to relax

478
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,720
something that takes my mind away from

479
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,440
all my

480
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,799
technical stuff that i do so recently i

481
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,600
picked up

482
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,840
caricatures i'm not good at carry

483
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,039
catchers i'm

484
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,919
i'm a good artist i want to say i draw

485
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,600
realistic or lifestyle

486
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,919
and cartoons pretty much everything now

487
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,000
i have kids so i draw a lot of cartoons

488
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,080
with them spend some time there but

489
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,919
caricatures were something that i wasn't

490
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,000
ever good at but i wanted to

491
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,520
up my game there as well the main focus

492
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,799
on carry catchers

493
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,240
was not about drawing what you see

494
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,120
it's drawing likeness it's not about

495
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,280
exaggerating it's not about distortions

496
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,440
or magnifications like we think

497
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,840
making the nose big or the head big or

498
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,039
small or whatever

499
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,799
it's not that at all it's actually just

500
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,080
the likeness

501
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,640
and the focus is on differences rather

502
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,840
than similarities

503
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,640
and that's what what was kind of unique

504
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,919
to caricatures because

505
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,559
i draw similarities what i see i draw

506
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,120
that's

507
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,679
real life portraits but caricatures no

508
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,200
that's

509
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,320
that's based on differences and i wrote

510
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,280
a small article

511
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,559
on caricatures on linkedin

512
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,640
like you see this this image of slash

513
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,600
drawn by tom richmond and there's not

514
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,480
even a face

515
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,400
in this and that's what blew my mind i'm

516
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,480
like wow the caricatures i thought was

517
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,320
all about faces but there's no face

518
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,720
it's just the presence of the person you

519
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,160
can tell that this is

520
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,679
uh slash and then people started drawing

521
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,440
me in that class that i took

522
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,679
and you can see every single drawing is

523
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,200
different it's unique

524
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,760
but most of them if not all of them kind

525
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,520
of look like me you can you can pick me

526
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,080
out from

527
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,919
a group if you see any one of these

528
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,919
caricatures but they're all

529
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,080
different none of them are realistic but

530
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,120
they all have a unique

531
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,559
characteristics so with that i said okay

532
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,039
let me let me start drawing caricatures

533
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,880
on my linkedin account on my

534
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,160
instagram account i started drawing

535
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,799
you know different caricatures of famous

536
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,080
people

537
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,600
i i record the process i go over

538
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,120
procreate and on my ipad and i start

539
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,000
drawing

540
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,200
and it's fun but it's not easy at all

541
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,240
this takes several several attempts to

542
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,039
get it right

543
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,400
and it's easy to draw well-known

544
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,480
personalities it's easy to draw

545
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,799
when you look at other caricatures but

546
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,240
it's it's challenging

547
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,919
at the same time the end result when you

548
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,480
see it it's it's fun

549
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,320
so i started taking this up so

550
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,400
my my best thing in this was i'm like

551
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,840
okay who who should i draw for today's

552
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,760
conference so i took um chris had maggie

553
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,679
fishing dark waters i said let's draw

554
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,600
him as a caricature

555
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,240
so i first i need reference photographs

556
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,159
so i met him a few times i took his

557
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,120
classes

558
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,360
and so i had pictures of him so i took

559
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,640
these two

560
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,679
pictures images and i

561
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,720
put them in my ipad

562
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,280
and i started drawing caricatures start

563
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,200
off with

564
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,159
a rough head sketch basically you have

565
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,039
to

566
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,559
get the idea of what am i going to

567
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,799
emphasize in this caricature so for this

568
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,799
i saw a bigger

569
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,480
lower half of the face than the upper

570
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,080
half and perspective

571
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,159
can vary in this so i started drawing

572
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,240
this out and this is a time lapse

573
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,200
drawing then you start to map out where

574
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,480
the main features would be

575
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,960
the nose eye relationship the mouth

576
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,240
everything else

577
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,679
and you start building it from there on

578
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,240
and drawing somebody when they're

579
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,760
looking straight at you is more

580
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,559
difficult

581
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,679
um i'm i'm not an expert at this

582
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,000
but the the three-quarters view is

583
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,080
always much much better

584
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,039
because all the features kind of pop out

585
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,080
and when you're looking somebody

586
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,679
straight on it

587
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,000
none of the features are popping out

588
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,080
they all look flat

589
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,799
so you have to use a lot of imagination

590
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,880
so as you can see i tried

591
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
many attempts at this and that's the key

592
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,400
to this you have to keep drawing

593
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,000
over and over and over again until

594
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,799
you're satisfied until the person

595
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,640
kind of looks like the person that

596
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,799
you're drawing and not just to you

597
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,559
i had to ask my wife a few times does

598
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,919
this look like this person and she's

599
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,080
like nah not really then i had to redraw

600
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,240
it redraw it over and over

601
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,640
and and you can see every time i'm

602
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,280
drawing

603
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,600
the face i'm changing something about

604
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,000
the the features that i see sometimes i

605
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,799
make the

606
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,559
lower half bigger i make the nose

607
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,240
smaller the eyes bigger

608
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,280
more squint and then the face the

609
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,080
the the mouth the the style that he's

610
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,440
smiling

611
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,400
things change up and there's something

612
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,000
sensitive about drawing caricatures

613
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,760
that's why i didn't draw them for a very

614
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,120
long time

615
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,760
people tend to get offended if you draw

616
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,799
their nose too big

617
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,000
or they're themselves too fat too thin

618
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,760
too tall to whatever um but i know chris

619
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,880
is uh a nice guy he's hopefully not

620
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,640
going to get offended by

621
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,080
all the screw-ups that i'm doing right

622
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,679
now but hey

623
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,159
this is part of it this is the fun part

624
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,640
you get a good laugh out of this

625
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,000
so as i'm trying different

626
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,120
ways you can see all my failures at the

627
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,679
bottom

628
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,640
i keep them next to me so i know what to

629
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,440
adjust

630
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,280
i look at all the rest and i say okay

631
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,039
the chin here looks nice i'll take the

632
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,559
chin from this one i'll take the eyes

633
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,520
from the other one

634
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,000
then i'll redraw it so i keep redrawing

635
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,720
it and

636
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,919
this is all practice if i was a pro

637
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,720
like tom richmond who i learned this

638
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,520
from

639
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
it would take me one shot to get it

640
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,960
perfectly right

641
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,440
but certain times you see i purposely

642
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,159
screw up

643
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,600
because i wanna i wanna

644
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,679
stretch it i wanna take it to the limits

645
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,799
and see

646
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,919
which one feature really defines

647
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,039
the presence of this person

648
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,640
so i keep drawing him over and over and

649
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,039
then eventually i'm satisfied with uh

650
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,080
with one and then i stick to it

651
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,159
i say okay this is the one let me

652
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,440
forward on a little bit

653
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,200
and then i start tracing over the one

654
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,880
that i like and

655
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,960
this becomes my final caricature piece

656
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,440
once i'm done with this i'm satisfied

657
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,320
with the head

658
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,679
now i move on to the rest of it the body

659
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,159
and so the way i do this let's go over

660
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,240
this one first so i take one of my own

661
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,320
references because i want to see how i

662
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,000
can draw

663
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,120
clothes which clothes suit him a suit

664
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,799
tie or just a t-shirt

665
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,440
so i experiment with it a little bit i

666
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:39,840
first

667
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,279
put on a t-shirt on him then i

668
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,640
try a suit i try different things

669
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,760
then i stick to one of them

670
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,600
and it's fun to watch progression

671
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,760
because you learn from your own mistakes

672
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,000
by no means am i an expert in this but

673
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,600
again this is for fun this is not

674
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,640
professional

675
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,200
this is not competitive for me by any

676
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,880
means

677
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,640
and drawing on an ipad is good because

678
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,000
you can undo your mistakes

679
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,640
so i keep drawing him over and over and

680
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,720
as you can clearly see you have to be

681
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,240
good at many things sketching a line

682
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,600
art drawing clothes bodies faces

683
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,360
hands and look at this hand it's

684
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,720
horrible the fist doesn't look like

685
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,840
the right hand so i redraw hands um it's

686
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,080
an

687
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,840
art again so i change the position

688
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,559
around a little bit once i'm satisfied

689
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,679
i i move on to the next sketch

690
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,600
so with this i'm like okay let's place a

691
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,960
bunch of usbs

692
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,120
here and there because that's what

693
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,000
social engineers

694
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,840
do they drop usbs every now and then

695
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,000
hoping that someone would pick them up

696
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,720
and put them in a computer

697
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,679
so i go through this process i have i

698
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,600
readjust my drawings the shoes and

699
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,240
everything

700
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,880
back and forth once i'm satisfied with

701
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,520
this

702
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,559
i go to the next phase

703
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,679
i start drawing things around him so

704
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,159
i draw a bunch of usbs i drop them on

705
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,039
the floor

706
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,440
i try to draw the background give this

707
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,320
area some presence some sense of where

708
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,760
he's standing

709
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,240
maybe a parking lot with some zebra

710
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,760
crossing or whatever

711
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,960
and once i'm done with that i

712
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,640
finish up the drawing and do some line

713
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,159
art on this so i start drawing it with

714
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,200
a pen a digital pen and

715
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,840
this will be my final artwork

716
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,120
so a lot of usb drops and one last video

717
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,320
that i'll show you

718
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,150
is how i actually do this the way

719
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,240
[Music]

720
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,159
someone would see me draw is basically

721
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,600
on an ipad

722
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,639
i turn things around i draw it in

723
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,480
short strokes different motions and

724
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,520
this is the entire process of

725
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,240
how i would go about drawing anything

726
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,840
from beginning to end

727
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,159
starting with a rough sketch refinement

728
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,679
then line art

729
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,520
and then eventually i would color it as

730
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,120
well but

731
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,679
that's what i like to do in the little

732
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,799
spare time that

733
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,760
i may have i may take this one step

734
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,640
further which i

735
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,200
didn't in this case i can color him but

736
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,840
he looks

737
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,159
terrible here not him but the my

738
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,440
coloring looks terrible

739
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,279
so i would leave it to this this would

740
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,880
be my final

741
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,480
artwork here all right so that's all i

742
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,360
had

743
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,279
any questions you see in the chat

744
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,919
yes we have uh several questions let me

745
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,000
just go ahead and scroll back up a

746
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,840
little bit here

747
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,440
now let's see a lot of people talking

748
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,159
about how

749
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,399
uh

750
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,399
oh i hate this it looks so good uh with

751
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,000
reference to your fishing although i

752
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,200
suppose that might work with the

753
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,000
caricature too

754
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
given some of the feedback there i'll

755
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
take it for the character

756
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,039
let's look for the the actual uh here we

757
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:09,440
go

758
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,480
uh alex is off asking when it comes to

759
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,919
internal phishing tests

760
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,080
what is your position on them should one

761
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,080
deploy the same tactics and templates

762
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,600
they would use elsewhere

763
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,880
to test internal users good question i

764
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,559
get this every time from a client

765
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,799
i say run your internal phishing

766
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,760
campaigns

767
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,559
i consider those at best basic or

768
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,120
intermediary style fishing campaigns

769
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,440
because those are pre-built templates

770
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,200
those are the most popular ones out

771
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,520
there

772
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,840
they don't require a lot of ocean and a

773
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,960
lot of background work

774
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,720
you may put some into it but at the end

775
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,000
of the day they're still

776
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
basic to intermediary style phishing

777
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,720
attacks you need a perspective from the

778
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,240
outside a professional

779
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,640
trained social engineer to do those

780
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,559
phishing attacks a pen tester

781
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,159
because when i do phishing attacks my

782
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,600
purpose is to get in

783
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,679
it's not to educate i say this is a pen

784
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,640
test this is not

785
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,360
educational yeah a part of it may be

786
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,320
educational

787
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,120
but my job is to mimic a hacker and get

788
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,520
in

789
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,279
you cannot achieve that internally

790
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,640
unless your

791
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,320
employees who are doing it are pen

792
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,559
testers or have gone through some social

793
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,640
engineering training to do it

794
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,799
i do this for really large organizations

795
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,640
and they have teams internally

796
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,080
and they're like okay we're set we're

797
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,000
done i come in and do the attack

798
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,880
and i almost every single time i get

799
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,360
through

800
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,279
all i need is one or two people one

801
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,799
basically all i need is one person to

802
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,559
submit credentials and i'm in

803
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,120
so i say do both have a tiered approach

804
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,760
internal

805
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,840
and external but don't forget the

806
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,000
external

807
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,279
fantastic uh from colgathas here we've

808
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,520
got a question as to whether you've

809
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,760
attended the human hacking conference

810
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,120
i didn't get a chance to go there yet

811
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,000
but i would have loved to i've taken

812
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,640
courses

813
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,080
by chris haddenaggi the social

814
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,320
engineering pen test so i'm certified by

815
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,440
him with that but

816
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,840
i would have loved to be part of the

817
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,200
human hacking conference

818
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,240
i just didn't get the opportunity all

819
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,279
right

820
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,440
uh so switching it up a little bit uh

821
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,440
when drawing caricatures of people you

822
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,320
actually know

823
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,399
have you had someone unhappy with how

824
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,640
they were represented

825
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,039
no i haven't and that's the fear of

826
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,440
carry catchers that i've always had so i

827
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,600
never drew anyone that i knew

828
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,679
in fears that they would look at it and

829
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,840
say hey i look so ugly or you made me

830
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,200
look so

831
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,720
i don't know whatever i just don't like

832
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,880
bad comments feedbacks and then they

833
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,480
look at me in a bad light

834
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,399
so i draw celebrities and stuff people

835
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,840
i'll probably never meet

836
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,679
i play it safe with caricatures nothing

837
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,840
wrong with that

838
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,120
let's see uh we have commentary uh

839
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,080
people like the usb drop aspect of the

840
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,039
one that you have on screen right now

841
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,679
uh pineapples represent chris pretty

842
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,360
well apparently

843
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,799
and let's take a look

844
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,760
if i missed any

845
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,640
[Music]

846
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,200
oh yeah i did i well

847
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,640
this person earlier asked

848
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,080
is using homoglyphs uh cheating in in

849
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,559
your fishing

850
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,039
no not not really homoglyphs won't work

851
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,000
every time

852
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,760
sometimes they'll look like weird

853
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,360
characters um

854
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,360
they'll expand to be some long

855
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,679
characters and stuff

856
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,240
the focus should never be on the domain

857
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,799
itself

858
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,120
particularly the focus should be on five

859
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,919
six different

860
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,480
aspects of it sometimes i hide my domain

861
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,880
by putting it in the

862
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,120
the name field so if it says from

863
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,200
linkedin security and in brackets it'll

864
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,760
say

865
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,559
linkedin at verification.com i'll put in

866
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,240
linkedin security and then

867
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,880
some fake brackets having you know

868
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,279
whatever no reply at linkedin.com

869
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,960
and then the actual email will be hidden

870
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,399
inside uh those

871
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,600
parentheses again people won't look that

872
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
that there are two different emails in

873
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
the in the header

874
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,240
and it will fool them so it's i've given

875
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,840
up on spoofing emails

876
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,600
on trying to um you know

877
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,760
to combat some of the technical controls

878
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,799
i just

879
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,919
focus on bypassing the human aspect of

880
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,279
this the human controls

881
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,279
i know the eyes will glance for just a

882
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,640
few seconds on an email

883
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,559
that's how i see it i've clicked on them

884
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,840
too everyone

885
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,919
can and will fall for it at some time so

886
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,440
if you focus on five six different

887
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,000
elements

888
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,519
on the phishing attack uh one or two

889
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,760
you know people may catch may fail but i

890
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,120
wouldn't focus on

891
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,039
just the domain piece of this there are

892
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,320
many ways to evade

893
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,159
the human firewall so i'm going to be a

894
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,960
little bit evil here and indulge myself

895
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,480
as a blue teamer and uh ask you

896
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,279
what has frustrated you the most what

897
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:03,840
what has

898
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,080
caused failures the most in your

899
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,039
workflow

900
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,919
uh with respect to phishing i don't fail

901
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:10,399
a lot

902
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,080
but not joking aside but

903
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,360
um usually sometimes it's the email

904
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,200
filters that get in the way

905
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,840
and they have really strong email

906
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,360
protection

907
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,120
they'll have multiple products in place

908
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,039
and they'll prevent the email from going

909
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,399
through because the email will be

910
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,679
flagged as

911
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,480
fishy or spammy so what i'll do is i'll

912
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,399
have multiple attempts at those and i'll

913
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,120
figure out

914
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,840
why it was spammed why it was marked as

915
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,320
spam

916
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,240
was it the domain sometimes the domain

917
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,519
is brand new so i buy

918
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,519
old domains i let them age and then it

919
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,000
goes through or maybe the subject line

920
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,320
was

921
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,039
linked in security if i change that to

922
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:49,519
uh

923
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,679
your password or your account has been

924
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,640
compromised

925
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,440
that doesn't seem as fishy as the first

926
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,000
one

927
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,760
and then it'll go through so it depends

928
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,200
on what

929
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,080
what the email security is using to

930
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,919
identify them once i figure that out

931
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,440
back and forth it takes me five six

932
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,080
emails

933
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,560
then i'm in and if i'm still not in then

934
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,359
i ask the

935
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,239
the client can you please whitelist this

936
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,280
email because

937
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,960
find your technical controls passed and

938
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
now let me test your human controls so

939
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,800
then they end up whitelisting it

940
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,320
and when it goes down to the human

941
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,159
controls i don't think i've ever

942
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,560
failed in the past a couple of hundred

943
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,679
attempts someone

944
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,839
always clicks on something and there's

945
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:28,719
at least

946
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,280
a small percent two to three percent

947
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,639
people who will actually submit

948
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,520
credentials

949
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,480
and that's what i'm after

950
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,839
and so following up just a little bit uh

951
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,480
do you have any particular ethical

952
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,800
considerations with regards to the lures

953
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
that you might use

954
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,520
in regards to what sorry the lures that

955
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,480
you might use the

956
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,320
the subject lines that kind of things

957
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,040
no because i don't use malicious subject

958
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,000
lines so

959
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
remember i talked about influence versus

960
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,160
manipulation i didn't talk about

961
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,640
that much but so my job is to influence

962
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,240
them into clicking on

963
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,720
a link which is kind of positive in

964
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,920
nature

965
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,160
it's not to trick them to fool them

966
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,440
nefariously so

967
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,640
which is which may end up making them

968
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,119
feel

969
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,680
bad uh so it's not about a 50 gift card

970
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,640
i'll never send

971
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,480
anything about money anything about

972
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,040
health issues or someone died or someone

973
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,440
resigned or you're fired or something

974
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,280
evil or mean that will

975
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,960
leave a bad impression in their heart

976
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,240
because at the end of the day they're

977
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,680
going to find out it was me

978
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,760
or my company that did it and our name

979
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,200
or my name is going to get

980
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,119
tarnished that hey you did something

981
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,040
evil that wasn't nice of you

982
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,119
i never want that feedback so in my

983
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,400
report i write that

984
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,960
i'm going to use a very small subset of

985
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,000
fishing lures

986
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,800
which are common amongst the wild and

987
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,359
they're

988
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,359
not as dangerous but i also say the

989
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,440
hackers will not be limited to this

990
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,160
the hackers will will do whatever it is

991
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,880
in their

992
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,040
uh heart that they desire to just get

993
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,640
through and they will use evil

994
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,240
nefarious ways so there's a lot of

995
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,640
things i cannot do i cannot mimic law

996
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,480
enforcement i cannot hurt someone's

997
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,359
feelings and

998
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,800
so i have to be cognizant of that

999
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,720
because hey at the end of the day i am

1000
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:12,960
an

1001
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,359
ethical hacker i'm not just a hacker

1002
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,599
fantastic and i'm i'm glad that you were

1003
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,920
able to address that so cogently

1004
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,960
uh someone actually was just asking that

1005
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,520
in the

1006
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,839
channel as you were speaking so i'm sure

1007
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,280
they'll get that in just a second when

1008
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,760
that uh propagates

1009
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,960
ah let's see uh we'll just wait for just

1010
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
a second to see if anyone else is going

1011
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,359
to

1012
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,480
submit a question but uh now

1013
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,880
it looks like we're about done with

1014
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,520
those

1015
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,560
