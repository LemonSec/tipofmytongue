1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
because it's here tales of both hacking

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,480
and climbing

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,759
from julian thank you um

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,120
first of all i'd like to thank everybody

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,360
who's joining uh this call

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,559
or this this talk anybody who's

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,760
participating in pancakes con

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,640
appreciate it um now the previous

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,240
thought was very very technical

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,840
and i'm a bit like um tom i i'm

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,560
not 100 sure of everything that he said

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:28,880
but

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,640
this is gonna be a lot less technical

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,479
we're gonna go through uh the pen

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,160
testing methodology so

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,280
um basically all the steps that i do

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,680
whenever i go onto a pen test engagement

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,200
uh just to make sure that the product

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,280
that pops out at the end is

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,160
more or less the same so that there's no

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,840
surprises or anything like that and that

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,320
we're following an actual process so

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,920
in that sense uh hacking in in my book

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,160
is

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,840
is science and art at the same time so

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,520
there is room to be creative but you

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,760
still need to follow a certain process

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,039
second part of my talk i'm going to be

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,280
talking about climbing um

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,280
so sorry

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,159

speaker

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,680
i'm a pen tester i'm a cyber security

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,119
consultant

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,479

project i'm working on i'm a co-leader

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,240
of a monk

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,240
of a owasp chapter here locally in

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,600
atlantic canada

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,920
started that last year i got a few

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,040
search under my

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,079
name as a cyber security consultant uh

45
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,240
certs are king just because it it gets

46
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,119
you contracts

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,799
uh people are looking for certain

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,560
letters after your name whenever you

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,840
you get con whenever you respond to

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,079
proposals um an outdoor enthusiast as

51
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,840
you can imagine because i

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,119
i'm gonna talk about climbing so of

53
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,040
course i love being outdoor

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,280
i'm a volunteer ski troller i love

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,640
adventure racing

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,880
and i'm also a husband a father to two

57
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,240
humans two cats

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,000
and a dog so i'm always tired basically

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,240
um so like i said the agenda we're gonna

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,439
go through

61
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,399
the methodology that i use i typically

62
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,160
use the pentest standard

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,319
methodology i find that it fits really

64
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,520
well

65
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,840
with the way i think and the way i like

66
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,280
to approach things there are other

67
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,200
methodologies out there you don't have

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,000
to follow this

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,480
one but it's the one that works for me

70
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,280
and then

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,640
second part we're just going to talk

72
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,959
about climbing

73
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,160
first thing i'd like to talk about a

74
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,239
little bit about hacking we're all cyber

75
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,840
security professionals here that are

76
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,280
listening

77
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,000
most likely uh we we know that watching

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,760
csi and watching the matrix

79
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,280
you know we're not as we're hacking

80
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,040
we're not flying down tunnels of ones

81
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,560
and zeros right it's not

82
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,840
it's not really how it's done if you

83
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,760
watch somebody who's sitting at a

84
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,319
terminal and and doing quote unquote

85
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,080
hacking penetration testing

86
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,440
it's not very exciting to watch it's

87
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,840
a couple of screens a person is probably

88
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,040
scratching his head

89
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,680
um depending on on how you handle your

90
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,360
emotions you might be screaming or

91
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
laughing depending whether you were

92
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,480
successful or not

93
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,560
and the other part of that spectrum is

94
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,239
that

95
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,400
while it's not all that exciting and

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,360
it's not

97
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,280
all that techy in the sense of you know

98
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,519
ones and zeros flying through the screen

99
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,879
finding somebody signed into

100
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,560
facebook and posting as them that's not

101
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,080
hacking either you know it's just

102
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,480
to you know just plain jokes so anyways

103
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,200
i thought that was a

104
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,319
kind of a funny meme um so let's get

105
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,440
through to

106
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
the seven phases of penetration testing

107
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,200
as per the pen testing standard

108
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,640
i'm gonna go through these one by one

109
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,480
and some i'll spend more time on some i

110
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
spend less time on but this is a good

111
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,239
overview of the steps

112
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,720
that we're taking whenever we go on a

113
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,319
pen test engagement

114
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,720
i'm not going to read off the slides

115
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,519
here but

116
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,080
it gives you a good understanding so

117
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,920
let's just go to step one

118
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,720
pre-engagement interactions i like to

119
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,599
joke around

120
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,080
um this is the part that a malicious

121
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,640
actor

122
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,799
is never going to do even though they're

123
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,319
following more or less the same

124
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,159
methodology that we do

125
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,439
a malicious hacker is not going to sit

126
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,799
down with his

127
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,519
client to discuss you know the rules of

128
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,478
engagements and

129
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,798
who to contact if something goes wrong

130
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,720
it's just not going to happen but us

131
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,960
as people that come in and we're getting

132
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,400
paid to do an engagement

133
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,320
this is probably one of the most

134
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,919
important parts

135
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,560
is setting client expectations we want

136
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,440
to

137
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,320
you know make them understand what they

138
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,800
can expect from this engagement a lot of

139
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,840
times

140
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,800
uh depending on the client i'll go in

141
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,199
and they have no idea what a pen test is

142
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,960
they just know that they need to get one

143
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,479
done so it's

144
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,440
really important for us to sit down talk

145
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,479
to them

146
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,560
talk about the goals what what they want

147
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
to accomplish is this because of a

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,919
regulatory body that wants them to have

149
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:58,720
a pen test

150
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,560
is this because one of their clients is

151
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,080
asking to have one

152
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,600
and our approach might be different

153
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
depending on why

154
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,000
they need a pen test one of the most

155
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,440
important parts here

156
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,160
is rules of engagement what am i allowed

157
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,120
to do and what am i

158
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,240
not allowed to do i mean if if you

159
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,840
follow security news you'll remember

160
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,759
about a year and a half ago

161
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,199
some i mean there might be some people

162
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,560
from that company that's listening to

163
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,919
this talk right now there were a couple

164
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,440
of individuals that

165
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,479
went uh past the rules of engagement and

166
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,280
they ended up

167
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,199
in a situation where they got arrested

168
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,880
and

169
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,240
basically brought out to the local

170
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,639
police department everything at the end

171
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,000
turned out great but

172
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
just to show that if you don't follow

173
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
the rules and engagements there might be

174
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,160
some serious consequences

175
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,560
so very important to uh to take in mind

176
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,720
once we've sat down with our client and

177
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,160
i'm gonna sound like a broken record

178
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,680
here as i go through these steps i'm

179
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,280
just gonna reiterate them just to put

180
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,880
you into context

181
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,319
uh so bear with me uh so once we've sat

182
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,160
down with our clients and we've

183
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,680
gone through scoping time estimation

184
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,199
what they expect of us and everything

185
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,039
else we can start um

186
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,600
in our actual pen test and the first

187
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,240
step

188
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,919
that i typically do and that's a good

189
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,520
and a good

190
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,039
thing to do is to just to gather

191
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,560
intelligence

192
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,639
at this point we're not even touching

193
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,600
their systems

194
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,680
we're going online and we're looking for

195
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,440
information about the company

196
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,560
uh why are we doing this well some

197
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,319
companies most companies most people

198
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,600
will hang

199
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,319
a lot of really important information

200
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,759
out in the open

201
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,199
this is what we call open source

202
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,520
intelligence what am i looking for i

203
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,479
might be looking for

204
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,759
job postings um you might wonder why

205
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,560
what does a job posting give me well if

206
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,759
they're looking for

207
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,680
somebody with 10 years experience in

208
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,880
cisco gear

209
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,520
well there's a really good chance that

210
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,000
there's

211
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,319
cisco equipment in the environment if

212
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,160
you're looking for a senior php

213
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,520
developer

214
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
there might be some really good

215
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,120
indication that they have php in their

216
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,759
environment

217
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,240
so they can gather all that information

218
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,120
and start

219
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
painting a picture of what their

220
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,240
infrastructure looks like

221
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,919
to be honest most of the time when i go

222
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,240
in to do a pen test i know this already

223
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,319
because in the essence of time they'll

224
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,319
give me some network diagrams they'll

225
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,720
give me some information on their

226
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,479
infrastructure but this is just a show

227
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,319
in a pen test just to show what somebody

228
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,080
with no information whatsoever could

229
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,800
find

230
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,599
other things that you can think of

231
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,880
support forms

232
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,880
here's a snippet of our configuration on

233
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,919
our firewall

234
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,080
and it's not working can you help us

235
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,400
well as a pen tester if i have a

236
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,080
little bit of their config file that's

237
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,680
on their firewall that's really good

238
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,479
information for me

239
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,400
so once i've gathered that information

240
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,759
i'm going to do a little bit of threat

241
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,960
modeling

242
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,240
this is not something that i spend a

243
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,479
whole lot of time doing

244
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,759
i like to call it a mini risk assessment

245
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,520
mostly the way i use this is mostly to

246
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,160
understand where i could focus my time

247
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,879
i'm gonna

248
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,840
identify the assets that's in place so

249
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,599
if they have health information that

250
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,360
they're trying to protect

251
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,240
i'm going to spend most of my time or i

252
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,440
don't want to say most of my time but

253
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,240
i'm going to spend

254
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,199
a good majority of my time focusing on

255
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,440
getting to that information

256
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,240
simply because that's uh the information

257
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,720
that a

258
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,639
an actual malicious hacker is going to

259
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,120
try to get to

260
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,599
so i find that it's good it's a good way

261
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,599
of understanding where to focus your

262
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,719
effort

263
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,799
simply because as a as a pen tester and

264
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,399
as somebody who's on

265
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,240
getting paid on contract i only have a

266
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,480
limited amount of amount of time

267
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,160
to do my tests and um a malicious actor

268
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,800
might have

269
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,959
year to year to be attacking this

270
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,959
environment i really need to make the

271
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,000
most out of the time

272
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,399
that i'm given whether it's time or

273
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,279
money

274
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,640
so that's why we want to do a bit of

275
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,279
threat modeling

276
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,680
so we've sat down with the client we've

277
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,120
gathered all the intelligence that we

278
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,480
could online

279
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
one thing i didn't touch on is looking

280
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,760
through breach databases

281
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,240
you might be able to find passwords

282
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,760
hanging out in the open that's

283
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,800
good information i mean you can

284
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,240
actually imagine why you wouldn't want

285
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
to have a username and password

286
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,519
when you're doing a pen test but that's

287
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,360
another thing that can be found there

288
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,519
uh did a little bit of threat modeling

289
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,600
and now we're really getting into

290
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,040
the meat of the engagement we are

291
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,560
actually attacking their systems

292
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,080
so the way we the first step is we're

293
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,000
going to check the doors i like

294
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,640
i like using analogies in the

295
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,680
vulnerability and

296
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,720
analysis stage i'm actually testing

297
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,040
doors i'm looking for

298
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,160
places where there might be a way in

299
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,360
so i'm gonna check if the doors unlock

300
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,000
i'm gonna check

301
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,360
where the windows are and everything

302
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,920
else um in a more technical sense i'm

303
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,480
looking at

304
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,640
services ports software that's installed

305
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
things that are unpatched things that

306
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,920
are misconfigured

307
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,000
any type of any type of technology that

308
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,839
i can use to my advantage

309
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,880
or misuse to my advantage to gain access

310
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,560
to their systems

311
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,480
how do i do this i can do this with

312
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,079
automated tools or i can do this

313
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,480
manually

314
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,720
there's great tools out there such as

315
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,680
you know

316
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,079
nessus nexpose openvas if you're looking

317
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,519
at open source stuff that's going to

318
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,800
scan a network

319
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,640
it's going to be fingerprinting services

320
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,480
and technologies we're looking for names

321
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,079
and version numbers

322
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,000
once we have that in hand we might go

323
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,079
online look at

324
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,120
your cvss database to see what kind of

325
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,320
vulnerabilities

326
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,240
lies in i don't know ticket lord 1.2

327
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,480
uh their ticketing system and see if

328
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,800
there's anything

329
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,959
of use there any exploits that i could

330
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,240
use i'm not

331
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,399
using those exploits yet i'm just again

332
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,839
painting a picture of

333
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,640
where i could focus my attention to try

334
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,440
to get into the systems

335
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,079
common misconfigurations is important

336
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,440
too especially in an active directory

337
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,600
environment where you could be

338
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,800
completely patched but if it's

339
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,839
misconfigured

340
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,760
there might be ways in so we're testing

341
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
all of these things

342
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,920
now this can be active in the sense that

343
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,680
i'm actually sending packets i'm hitting

344
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,440
systems and they're responding back

345
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,800
or it could be passive i could be

346
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,480
sitting in an environment somewhere and

347
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,640
just sniffing the wire and seeing

348
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,120
uh what kind of protocols are are being

349
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,920
passed around

350
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,040
what kind of things can i see passively

351
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,120
so that i don't get caught

352
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,640
and that's an important point getting

353
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,320
caught i'm talking about pen testing i'm

354
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,920
not talking about red teaming

355
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,040
pen testing um you're not trying to be

356
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,120
silent here you're just trying to find

357
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,399
flaws you're trying to find

358
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,639
vulnerabilities you're not trying to

359
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,200
evade intrusion detection systems you're

360
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,440
not trying to evade their

361
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,600
web application firewall you're actually

362
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
trying to find if the web application

363
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,240
has a flaw so you're not trying to be

364
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,160
silent here this can be very very

365
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,720
loud it would be a lot different in a

366
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,399
red teaming environment where

367
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,760
you're trying to be silent and you're

368
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,920
trying not to get caught this step would

369
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,240
be

370
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
very very different but you would still

371
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,120
go through this step

372
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,880
next up um we've we've sat down with the

373
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,360
client

374
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,040
we've gathered intelligence we did a bit

375
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,959
of threat modeling we we have a good

376
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,800
understanding of where the flaws might

377
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,320
be in their systems we're gonna try to

378
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,000
exploit those flaws

379
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,040
um one of the ways that i like to

380
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,160
uh uh talk about exploitation is

381
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,920
you you know there's a door there now

382
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,200
we're trying to pick that lock

383
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,880
because we know the lock is easily

384
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,120
pickable uh we're gonna try to pick that

385
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,279
law open the door and stick our head in

386
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,160
try to see what's there this is mostly

387
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,680
all manual work and this is where the

388
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
creative part of the pen testing comes

389
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,920
in you have to think outside the box

390
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,639
uh you you're trying to make system

391
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,399
you're trying to make

392
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,480
have systems do things that they're not

393
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,760
designed to do

394
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,920
so you're trying to bypass security

395
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,600
mechanism and sometimes you have to

396
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,200
think outside the box you have to be

397
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,600
creative you have to you know try it a

398
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
certain way and if that doesn't work

399
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,200
you might want to try another way of

400
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,480
doing things so

401
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,160
there's a lot of creativity that can

402
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,519
come into this this

403
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,560
phase the exploit and the post exploit

404
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,880
phase

405
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,120
some exploit code might need to be

406
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,720
modified you might have to write some

407
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,880
exploit code that's more of an advanced

408
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,279
uh

409
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,920
pen testing thing to do you might not

410
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,440
have time most of the

411
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,079
i mean if if you're going to start

412
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,519
writing exploit code

413
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,920
and you have five days to pen test the

414
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,199
full environment you might just don't

415
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,560
have time so

416
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,800
this is something that uh security

417
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,560
researchers might do on the side

418
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,120
and then release to the public so that i

419
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,920
can go in

420
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,000
and i mean call me a script kitty if you

421
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,639
want uh scripts are easy and fun to use

422
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,120
up to a certain point

423
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,760
and proof of concept code is always

424
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,680
popping out

425
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,760
just grab it from reliable sources make

426
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,720
sure that

427
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,880
it's you know review you don't want to

428
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,480
send something into an environment that

429
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,160
might infect them or whatnot just make

430
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,880
sure that you

431
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,480
you review those exploits that you're

432
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,680
running against their systems

433
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,240
so what do we do once we've exploited a

434
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,920
system you know we we've found those

435
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,480
flaws

436
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,600
we've exploited the system we're in um

437
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
well i mean why not move in you see

438
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,519
buddy here in that uh

439
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,000
in that photo he's moving his boxes in

440
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,279
and and that's what we're doing

441
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,480
at this point exploit move um

442
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,040
we've gotten access to a system whether

443
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,680
it's low

444
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,199
a low privileged user or

445
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,519
it might not be a system that seems that

446
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,240
useful

447
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,920
to us right now but we just want to make

448
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,560
sure that we can

449
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
we can stay in and that we have access

450
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,000
to it for

451
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,279
a little bit of time i don't like to

452
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,720
read from slides but this second

453
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,120
sentence to me is very important

454
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
so we're talking about the value of the

455
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,399
machine it is determined by the

456
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,320
sensitivity of the data that's stored on

457
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,160
it but not only that

458
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,519
if you get into a system and there's no

459
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,079
you

460
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,839
you look around and there's nothing of

461
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,440
use here you don't want to back out

462
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,480
because this system

463
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,760
might be your pivot into further

464
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,440
compromising the network you might be

465
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
able it might be a dual home machine

466
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,480
that has

467
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,399
an internal ip that you couldn't see

468
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,160
from where you're sitting so you might

469
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,320
be able to use this machine

470
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,519
to look further into the network or to

471
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:37,920
move

472
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,279
laterally into other systems there might

473
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,040
be some scripts lying around

474
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,120
with passwords there might be all kinds

475
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,480
of stuff you can do with this machine

476
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,839
even though the machine itself doesn't

477
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,120
look very useful to you

478
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
doesn't mean it's not it means that it

479
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,639
might be used

480
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,240
to do other things um and that brings us

481
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,600
to

482
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,120
our next um it's not a phase i guess

483
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,639
it's more a question that we're going to

484
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,279
go back to our vulnerability analysis so

485
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,279
we we've looked at all the exploits or

486
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,880
we looked at all the vulnerabilities

487
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,120
inside of their systems

488
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,560
and um we've exploited one of them

489
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,440
at this point uh just for an example we

490
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,320
were able to

491
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,399
do a little bit of post post

492
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,680
exploitation

493
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,240
now we have two choices are we going to

494
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,600
take this new machine that we have

495
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,240
access to

496
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,040
and run vulnerability analysis from that

497
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,920
viewpoint

498
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,199
in further into their network or

499
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,279
do we want to step back look at our

500
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,480
vulnerability scans

501
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,440
and find another vulnerability that we

502
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,399
might exploit

503
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,240
so either way we're rinse and repeating

504
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,120
um do vulnerability analysis do

505
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,000
exploitation do

506
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,240
post exploitation we keep going round

507
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,839
and round and round

508
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,399
i don't know if i'm doing any copyright

509
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,519
infringement here

510
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,160
with this try harder but what you want

511
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,880
to do is try again and try harder

512
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,599
keep going until when well until you run

513
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,280
out of time right because

514
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,760
this is a paid engagement they only have

515
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,359
a certain budget

516
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,359
and you want to be able to hit

517
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,559
everything

518
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,880
and hit all the goals and do everything

519
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,240
that they want you to look at

520
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,679
but at some point you're just going to

521
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,160
run out of time and run out of budget

522
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,079
so that's when you're going to stop as

523
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,599
opposed to a malicious actor who's going

524
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,520
to stop when he gets bored or he gets

525
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,120
what he wants

526
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,400
we're just going to keep going and give

527
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
value to the customer

528
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,160
for as long as we've we've got time

529
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,000
and um last but not least

530
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,280
uh we need to give a report um

531
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,520
again this is self-explanatory but i

532
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,440
like to laugh a little bit

533
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
because it is a dreaded question

534
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,679
sometimes when can we expect the report

535
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,440
when i'm done a pen testing engagement

536
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,919
and i'm done to to writing the report

537
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,880
while writing the report can be a it's

538
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,200
fun by itself i'm a hands-on guy i just

539
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
want to go on to the next

540
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,880
engagement and do all the cool stuff

541
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,520
like uh you know not flying down tunnels

542
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,280
of ones and zeros but trying to exploit

543
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,880
vulnerabilities in systems

544
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,559
the report is not very

545
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,120
a technically challenging thing to do

546
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,799
though it is a very challenging thing to

547
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,080
do right

548
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,200
again you can be creative here and why

549
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
is the report important because

550
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
again reading from slides the report is

551
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,799
the tangible output of the testing

552
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,919
process

553
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,320
it's the only real evidence that a test

554
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,640
actually took place

555
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,120
if you've done your job right you're

556
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,799
leaving no trace

557
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,280
you're there's no indication that you

558
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,000
were even

559
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
ever there maybe a little bit in the

560
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,679
logs but the logs you know they'll get

561
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,880
flushed out eventually

562
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,240
but the report's always going to be

563
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,240
there and the report is going to show

564
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,960
that test was done uh and we're going to

565
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,039
be able to show it to

566
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,200
all kinds of people including auditors

567
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
including regulatory

568
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,919
uh bodies that need you to be pen-tested

569
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,039
clients

570
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,919
um we're going to give a letter saying

571
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,520
that this was done

572
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,880
and in the report what you want to do is

573
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,720
you need to assume that

574
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,240
there's three types of people that's

575
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,080
going to be digesting that report

576
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,280
we're going to have senior management

577
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,799
they want to have the executive summary

578
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,080
non-technical

579
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,559
are we good are we bad and most of the

580
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,440
time it's bad

581
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,320
how bad is it it management they want to

582
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,880
look at

583
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
what the system looks like and be able

584
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,840
to budget time and budget people to be

585
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,440
fixing those vulnerabilities

586
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,559
and then a really really technical

587
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,360
section where it shows you exactly how

588
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,520
to reproduce the results line by line

589
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,799
what scripts were run

590
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,720
what did you see what did you do for the

591
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,480
it staff that's going to fix the holes

592
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,360
they can go in

593
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,480
and really understand what's going on um

594
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,840
so i'm right in the middle of my

595
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,720
presentation here and

596
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,799
i'm basically done on the pen testing

597
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,160
methodology

598
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,480
um as we can see all the steps are laid

599
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,679
out in front of us

600
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,559
if we follow these steps there is room

601
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,280
for creativity inside of each of these

602
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,760
but we definitely do want to follow

603
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,120
these steps to make sure that the

604
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,720
product that comes out at the end

605
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,960
is repeatable and something of value

606
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,679
um so i'm gonna thank you for this part

607
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,320
of the

608
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,919
presentation you've got my linkedin here

609
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,520
twitter i just uh got a twitter um

610
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,679
i think a few days ago honestly and i'm

611
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,520
gonna start posting some content on

612
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,159
there

613
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,919
uh most of the content that i've posted

614
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,760
up to now is on linkedin

615
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,200
uh so let's um

616
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,039
please think of questions that you might

617
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,559
have and we might have time at the end

618
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,320
to do some questions if not we can take

619
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,200
them to slack

620
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,799
but i'd like to get to the other part of

621
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,679
my report here

622
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,919
give you a big warning here i go from

623
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,440
dark mode to light mode

624
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,880
the next slide is going to be very very

625
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,240
bright so you might want to put your

626
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
sunglasses on shield your eyes or

627
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,360
um just be careful one two three here we

628
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,440
go

629
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,200
climbing uh some of you might know why i

630
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,960
call this talk because it's there

631
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,919
um they've been because it's there has

632
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,240
been

633
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,679
called the um

634
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,200
the three most famous line in

635
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,000
mountaineering in the 1920s george

636
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,720
mallory

637
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,200
set out to climb mount everest uh he

638
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
went three or four times i forget

639
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,679
my history is not that great of climbing

640
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,600
but he went out to climb mount everest

641
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,720
and um at a press conference

642
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,039
uh it i mean there is some question

643
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,640
whether he actually said this or not or

644
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,280
if it was paraphrasing from the uh

645
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,880
from the report or whatnot but it came

646
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,480
out in the news later on that when he

647
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,200
was asked why do you want to climb mount

648
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,840
everest

649
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,320
he answered because it's there and i

650
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,919
feel the same way with hacking sometimes

651
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,200
i know that as

652
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,640
as i was a kid and i know a lot of

653
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,400
people that started out in the industry

654
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,159
by just looking around their desk

655
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,840
and looking around you know no internet

656
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,760
nothing just a few games

657
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,520
um it was there so we just wanted to try

658
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,280
and hack it and see what we could

659
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,039
do with a system see if we could push it

660
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,960
to its limit and see if we could bypass

661
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,240
certain things so

662
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,480
um why climb stuff because it's there

663
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,679
why hack stuff

664
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,120
because it's there so i thought it was a

665
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,039
good way to uh to call this

666
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,480
um this talk quick disclaimer

667
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,640
climbing is dangerous and i have no

668
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,559
credentials on the subject whatsoever i

669
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,320
used to have a

670
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,159
certification for it was called climbing

671
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,159
wall association lead assessor or

672
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,520
something like that internal

673
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,159
uh that's been a last a long time ago

674
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,159
but i just like to go out and climb

675
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,679
another thing i didn't write here is

676
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,440
that i haven't had the chance to climb

677
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,400
as much as i've

678
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,559
wanted to in the last i would say two

679
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,679
years

680
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,400
so if ever you do run into me at a cliff

681
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
somewhere at a climbing gym and i'm

682
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,480
barely making up the wall it doesn't

683
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,240
mean that i don't like climbing it just

684
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,559
means that i haven't had time to go out

685
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,679
and climb um most of the by the way most

686
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,880
of the photos here are photos that have

687
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,480
been taking on on trips that i've been

688
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,039
on

689
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,280
um so what's on the agenda

690
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
uh what are i'm gonna talk about the

691
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,799
types of climbing it's a little bit like

692
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,679
information technology or cybers the

693
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:14,559
cybers like

694
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,679
one of my podcasters that i love says

695
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,600
um climbing is a little bit like ikey

696
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,320
where

697
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,480
you might run into somebody that says

698
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,960
hey um my brother's a climber he's been

699
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,520
up mount rainier out west and you're a

700
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,480
boulder

701
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,600
um you don't really have the same skill

702
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,559
set

703
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,799
though they a lot of people that do

704
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,400
mountaineering will do bouldering too

705
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,799
but

706
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,200
uh same thing as as i.t or cyber

707
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
security or

708
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,919
anything like that you might run into

709
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,679
somebody and they'll say uh

710
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,440
oh yeah i know somebody who's in it uh

711
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,880
he's a developer and you're in tech

712
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,159
support well you know

713
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,919
you might not have the same skill set so

714
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,600
climbing is a bit like that

715
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,520
it's a catch-all term and there are a

716
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,440
bunch of different types of climbing

717
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,520
one thing i want to go through too is

718
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,559
why i call

719
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,600
climbing methodical and why i call them

720
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,000
a climbing creative same as pen testing

721
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,440
there is

722
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,640
science and there is art to

723
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,840
climbing one thing that i find fun about

724
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,679
climbing is the vocabulary like any

725
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,240
esoteric type

726
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,080
sports or or endeavors that you might do

727
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,640
there's some pretty funny vocabulary

728
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,600
sometimes

729
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,039
feel free to ask me about this on the

730
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,559
slack channel later on but there's one

731
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,679
here that

732
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,080
is probably screaming out to you

733
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,679
screaming obviously

734
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,640
it's called the screen bar fees it's a

735
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,400
it's an actual technical term

736
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,080
um it's a term used in ice climbing so

737
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,520
when you're ice climbing you've got

738
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,159
these

739
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,919
ice axes i actually i have a

740
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,840
show-and-tell here so you have these ice

741
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,799
axes

742
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,480
um and you're swaying this on top of

743
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,000
your head right all the time

744
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,400
it's cold your gloves are not that

745
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,000
insulated because you want to have a

746
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,760
good feel to your hands and everything

747
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,480
else so hands on top of your head

748
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,799
really cold blood drains out of your

749
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,840
hands

750
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,039
you get to the top of the climb um shake

751
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,720
out a little bit either you anchor up

752
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
there or you get lower down

753
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,240
and then all of a sudden that warm blood

754
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,640
goes back into your hands your hands are

755
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,840
freezing

756
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,880
no blood into them pins and needles warm

757
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,240
blood comes rushing in

758
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,919
it hurts well they call it the screaming

759
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,360
barfi because you want to scream and

760
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,520
barf at the same time

761
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,320
that's basically what the term is so

762
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,120
again

763
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,000
dino dirt bag is a good term just feel

764
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,799
free to reach out

765
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,400
and we can chat about these things

766
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,000
so let's go through the types of

767
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,480
climbing um

768
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,520
the types of climbing i've i've ordered

769
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,159
these in

770
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,520
in terms of complexity and commitment uh

771
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,679
commitment in the sense of um

772
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,640
being out in nature in being in a place

773
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,120
where

774
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,799
if you get hurt it might be hard to get

775
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,679
rescued and in

776
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,120
commitment in the sense of how much

777
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,960
money it takes to

778
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,799
get into it and how much knowledge you

779
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,559
need so

780
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,039
first off gym climbing gym climbing is

781
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,039
great it's a great way to get introduced

782
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:13,840
to the uh

783
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,960
to the sport um

784
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
safe way to do it there's always people

785
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,279
out there to help you can take courses

786
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,320
uh there's no not a whole lot of

787
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,720
objective

788
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,919
hazards such as falling rock uneven

789
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,080
uneven terrain and stuff like that it's

790
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,760
a great place to get started i

791
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,039
highly recommend anybody who's

792
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,880
interested in climbing to at least go

793
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,440
out

794
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,159
to the climbing gym and uh take a course

795
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:40,960
or

796
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,880
or just find somebody who's interested

797
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
in going

798
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,960
next up on our journey we're gonna talk

799
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,919
about bouldering bouldering is

800
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,880
well climbing a boulder right no ropes

801
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,440
no

802
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,080
safety equipment except for the mat here

803
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,039
you can see that

804
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,279
um as i'm climbing this rock there's a

805
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,520
mat at the bottom so if i do fall

806
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,640
or when i fall in my case i'm not going

807
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,440
to hit

808
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,960
the hard ground i'm actually going to

809
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,880
hit this uh pad

810
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,039
that's there and yes that thing does

811
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,799
fold up and you put on your bag just

812
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,159
like a backpack

813
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,960
and you walk up to the boulder and you

814
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,600
go up

815
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,000
and climb so you don't need a whole lot

816
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,600
of equipment you don't need a lot of

817
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,360
knowledge on how to set up systems

818
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,120
security systems you can just

819
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,880
go out and climb boulders i mean if

820
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,520
you're interested enough you don't even

821
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,240
need a mat

822
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,159
i mean the only problem with bouldering

823
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,320
is every fall you hit the ground

824
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,720
and at my age i don't boulder as much

825
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,080
because hitting the ground hurts

826
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,760
next up we've got top roping i'm going

827
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,840
to take the laser pointer here

828
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,640
just to show a little something so top

829
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,240
roping as you can imagine

830
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,760
jim climbing's in the gym bouldering is

831
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,520
in boulders on boulders

832
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,640
top roping the ropes on top of you so in

833
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,840
this case you can see that

834
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,159
as i'm belaying my daughter here when

835
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,039
she was younger

836
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,880
the rope goes all the way up to the top

837
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,960
of the cliff and back down to her

838
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,480
there's an anchor up there that was set

839
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,240
up so you need to know how to

840
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,799
build a bomber anchor you need to know

841
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,240
how to belay

842
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,399
using a device like this like a belay

843
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,520
device

844
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,480
um and you have to own a rope and

845
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,080
everything else but

846
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,080
if or when she falls

847
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,320
the rope is she's not falling basically

848
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,760
she's just leaning against the rope

849
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,200
there might be a little bit of slack in

850
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,399
the system and the rope

851
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,640
will stretch but in this sense it's

852
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,159
really safe because you're not you're

853
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,000
not falling you're just leaning against

854
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,120
the rope

855
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,039
and it's a great way to get really

856
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,880
comfortable outdoors you can top rope in

857
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,360
the gym

858
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,479
also so this would be your next step

859
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,080
next up we've got sport climbing i'm

860
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,520
going to keep my laser here i know it's

861
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,120
annoying when it's on the screen

862
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,360
but sport climbing is when

863
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,279
the rope you're bringing the rope up

864
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,600
with you as you climb the cliff

865
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,120
as you can see here the rope is not

866
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,880
going to the top of the cliff

867
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,360
my pretty my my lovely wife here is

868
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,039
actually bringing the rope up as she's

869
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,919
going and what she's doing is that

870
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,080
people that have developed these cliffs

871
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,240
these climbing areas they've actually

872
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,520
drilled bolts into the rock and as you

873
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,080
go up

874
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,919
you use a um a quick draw quick rod it

875
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,120
clip on onto the

876
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,840
the cliff and then you clip your rope

877
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,559
here

878
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,000
so this really protects you you could

879
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,320
i mean you could hang a semi truck on on

880
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,279
these things

881
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,159
uh so it's not a 110 pounds falling

882
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,200
woman that's gonna

883
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,840
rip this out of the cliff right um but

884
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,200
the reason i call this a bit more

885
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,360
committed is as you can see here where

886
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,840
she's

887
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,720
standing if she were to fall she would

888
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,559
fall and kind of swing

889
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,080
a little bit right because this is the

890
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,760
part that's gonna that's gonna secure

891
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,159
her

892
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,840
now if she keeps climbing here and she

893
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,600
gets to this part and she's already not

894
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,080
clipped to another piece of protection

895
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,440
the fall is gonna be a lot more

896
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,200
committing because she's gonna fall all

897
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,600
the way down to this piece of equipment

898
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,799
then all the way down that same

899
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,279
length all the way down here plus the

900
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,640
stretching the rope she might end up

901
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,919
down here

902
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,960
that's a serious fall and that is

903
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,039
extremely scary when you're you're on

904
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,120
top of your last piece of protection

905
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,559
and you're looking at a fall and you're

906
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,799
looking at a 10-foot fall

907
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,679
a lot of things can go wrong in that

908
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,480
type of fall

909
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,399
but it's still very very safe

910
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,559
one thing to keep in mind here all this

911
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,679
equipment

912
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,559
the rope the harness the carabiners the

913
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:42,880
the

914
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,000
bolts on the rock they're all there just

915
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,960
to protect you

916
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,559
you're not using those pieces of

917
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,960
equipment to

918
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,320
pull yourself up the cliff you're

919
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,760
actually using only your hands and feet

920
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,679
now we get into trad climbing if you get

921
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,760
into an area that has

922
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,840
lots of cracks you know there's a nice

923
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,360
little splitter crack here and you see

924
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,039
all these pieces of equipment well these

925
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,559
are pieces of equipment

926
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,200
that you put in yourself so you're

927
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,720
looking at a cam

928
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,080
that actually goes into the rock and as

929
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,440
you pull on it

930
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,840
the the boat the lobes kind of push out

931
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,679
so they really protect you

932
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,519
but that's a lot more committing you've

933
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,559
got nuts you're just going to slide into

934
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,519
ah here slide into the the crack like

935
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:27,919
this

936
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,000
and if you fall it's going to hold you

937
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,760
but you still really know how to

938
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,240
you still really need to know how to you

939
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,919
know put these pieces of equipment in so

940
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:36,559
that they're

941
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,840
they'll hold and that's why it's a lot

942
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,399
more commitment on the safety side

943
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,320
and these things cost a lot of money so

944
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,919
it's going to cost you a lot of money to

945
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:44,559
to get

946
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,880
into here but at this point if you're

947
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,720
lead trad climbing

948
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,360
um you've been climbing for a little

949
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,158
while already

950
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,640
so as you can see we started off in the

951
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,960
gym falling on mats

952
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,159
with people helping you out and

953
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,760
everything else and now we're out in

954
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,399
nature

955
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,000
probably by ourselves putting our own

956
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
pieces of gear on the rock

957
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,279
and uh it takes a lot of more

958
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,440
mental fortitude and and whatnot to be

959
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,360
able to do this type of climbing

960
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,480
it's a lot of fun though um

961
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,519
scream barfis look at that um let's take

962
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,840
my opponent off here

963
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,240
so ice climbing uh this is the type of

964
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,039
climbing that i refuse to bring my kids

965
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,440
climbing because basically you're

966
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,320
strapping

967
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,519
26 knives to your body and you're

968
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,760
crawling your way up the ice

969
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,519
so as we looked earlier this ice acts

970
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,399
pretty sharp at the end and then you've

971
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,919
got these things

972
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,240
in your feet um i don't want my son to

973
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,000
throw a tantrum and start kicking me

974
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,200
with these things so i'd rather not

975
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,600
bring him

976
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,279
ice climbing plus it's cold miserable um

977
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,840
for him it's a lot of fun it's a lot of

978
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,720
fun

979
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,679
um so yeah so that's ice climbing

980
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,519
uh other types of climbing alpine

981
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,519
climbing is out in the high mountains it

982
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,440
might take you a day or two to get

983
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,279
or maybe a full day but it's a full

984
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,720
committing

985
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
thing it's not parking your car walking

986
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,880
five minutes to the local cliff

987
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,120
this is actually going out in the high

988
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,159
mountains

989
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,559
and hitting a cliff wall whether it's

990
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,080
ice or rock or whatnot

991
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,720
mixed climbing is a it's a mix of ice

992
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,519
and rock

993
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,279
you're you still have those crampons and

994
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,200
those ice tools in your hand but you're

995
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,640
wedging them against the rock in the

996
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,919
rock sections and

997
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,279
hitting them into the um

998
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,519
hitting them into the ice uh in the

999
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,399
icing sections mountaineering

1000
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,519
it's not as technical uh again in the

1001
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,279
high mountains

1002
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,000
uh you're roped up to other people

1003
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,039
because you're on a

1004
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,600
on a glacier you're doing glacier travel

1005
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,880
most likely

1006
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,559
and there are crevasses that you can

1007
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,640
fall into hidden crevasses under the

1008
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,240
the snow in the eyes that you might fall

1009
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,000
into so you're you're strapped to other

1010
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,039
people

1011
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,240
and aid climbing um is

1012
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,199
a very different type of climbing where

1013
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:09,839
i

1014
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,760
i was talking earlier about putting your

1015
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,879
pieces of equipment

1016
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,719
into the rock but only using that

1017
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,320
equipment as

1018
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,960
protection in case that you fall aid

1019
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
climbing you're you will actually

1020
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,639
put some weight on that equipment

1021
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,000
pulling on that equipment

1022
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,079
uh so instead of just using the rock and

1023
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,679
just using your hand and feet you might

1024
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,560
be putting

1025
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,159
a piece of equipment and pulling on that

1026
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,599
piece of equipment to bring yourself

1027
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,359
up uh the cliff

1028
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,839
um so basically those are the types of

1029
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,280
climbing that are out there there are

1030
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,879
other forms and other terms and other

1031
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,480
ways to mix all of these

1032
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,800
ones up but it should give you a good

1033
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,520
understanding of why climbing is a very

1034
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,599
wide sport and a boulder might not have

1035
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,239
the same skill sets as a trad climber

1036
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,918
which might not have the same skill sets

1037
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,280
as a mountaineer

1038
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,000
but something that's in common with all

1039
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,760
of climbing is that we're building

1040
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,000
systems to protect ourselves or in the

1041
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,160
case of aid climbing to actually

1042
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,359
go up the cliff so it can get pretty

1043
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,560
complicated

1044
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,920
one thing that i really really like

1045
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,680
about climbing and

1046
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,280
and it's also one of the things that i

1047
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,720
like about it

1048
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,200
is sitting down and talking to people

1049
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,119
after a day of climbing we'll sit around

1050
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,400
the campfire

1051
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,240
and talk about the newest gear the

1052
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,079
newest methods

1053
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,599
why a knot like a knot

1054
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,240
that we would use in a certain situation

1055
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
they did some tests in the lab and that

1056
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,800
knot

1057
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,200
is not good for that situation anymore

1058
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,960
because they've noticed that in certain

1059
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,880
situations it's going to fail

1060
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,720
so you should use another knot and it's

1061
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
a very very technical

1062
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,560
sport in that sense and i mean you saw

1063
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,119
me

1064
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,880
pushing gear up there's a lot of gear

1065
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,320
and a lot of

1066
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,040
gadgets right so in that sense it's very

1067
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,280
methodical if i get to a cliff

1068
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,880
first thing i want to do is make sure

1069
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,960
that um

1070
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,800
it's safe make sure that if i build an

1071
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,400
anchor i build it the correct way with

1072
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
the correct knots with the correct

1073
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,400
uh forces and and it's all physics and

1074
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,320
so it's very methodical in that sense

1075
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,599
but at the same time

1076
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,800
climbing can be very creative mostly

1077
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,240
because

1078
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,599
well you look at this climb here that's

1079
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,520
a cool little climb here in atlantic

1080
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,359
canada it's called gollum's cave

1081
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,800
it hits all the nerd uh things

1082
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,160
and um the this

1083
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,520
this part as you can see i decided to

1084
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,240
climb up

1085
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,480
this i'm gonna take my pointer again

1086
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,920
here my laser pointer so

1087
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,599
i decided to go up here because for me

1088
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,760
it fits somebody might have decided to

1089
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,200
climb this crack here

1090
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,119
uh somebody might have decided to you

1091
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,119
know pop out and climb the

1092
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,000
rat here there's multiple ways up and

1093
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,599
you got to pick the one that works great

1094
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,040
for you

1095
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,520
another thing that i've noticed is you

1096
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,960
know when you're working on a problem in

1097
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,680
it and

1098
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,760
you wake up in the middle of the night

1099
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,200
and um

1100
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,800
you you you wake up in the middle of

1101
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,440
sorry i've got

1102
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,960
chats i should have turned that off but

1103
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,079
you wake up in the middle of the night

1104
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,440
and you all of a sudden you go like

1105
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,480
wow i solved the problem in my sleep you

1106
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,079
you weren't even dreaming of it you just

1107
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,079
woke up and go like i know the solution

1108
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,560
i've been in situations when

1109
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,160
um i've i was climbing uh trying to

1110
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,440
solve a problem

1111
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,119
you know there's a sequence of moves

1112
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,800
that i can't do i can do all the moves

1113
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,480
leading up to it

1114
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,560
i somehow shimmy it around it or pulled

1115
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,240
on gear and i can do all the second part

1116
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,760
of the climb but that one move i just

1117
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,119
can't figure it out

1118
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,200
i've had multiple instances where i wake

1119
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,280
up in the middle of the night

1120
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,359
and i've solved it i know exactly why

1121
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,960
i was using these two fingers and i

1122
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,960
needed to use these two fingers instead

1123
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,640
and my weight was completely changed and

1124
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,440
everything else

1125
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,280
next day i go to the gym or the climbing

1126
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,440
area and lo and behold i've solved the

1127
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,800
problem in my sleep

1128
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,359
so in that sense it's also very creative

1129
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,359
i think we have a few minutes left i see

1130
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,359
here i did have a few questions

1131
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,119
i'm just gonna first of all thank you

1132
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,359
there's my socials again like i said my

1133
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,040
twitter is pretty bare at the moment but

1134
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,560
i'm gonna be using it a lot more

1135
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,880
going forward and um any questions i saw

1136
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,119
a couple come in yeah so here's what

1137
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,400
we've got for questions

1138
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,040
uh do you find oswe type of trainings to

1139
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,880
be useful for your team now

1140
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,920
and in the future uh oswe

1141
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,960
uh definitely any hands-on training

1142
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,160
um certs like i said is big in the

1143
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,520
consulting world

1144
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,400
but anything from uh that that actually

1145
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,920
gets your hands on the keyboard

1146
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,359
tests your technical skills like oscp

1147
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,320
oswe

1148
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,920
oscp all these certs that i have actual

1149
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
real world lab work

1150
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,680
definitely uh something to look into

1151
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,040
all right and from the same person what

1152
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,520
are your thoughts on free soloing

1153
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,960
freestyle i knew that was going to be a

1154
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,040
good question um don't do it

1155
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,880
it's extremely dangerous if people don't

1156
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,800
know free soloing is using just your

1157
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,680
hands and feet

1158
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,320
with no protection uh there's a movie

1159
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,880
that come out came out called free solo

1160
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,320
alex honold is the world's uh

1161
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,000
crazy person in free solo um there is no

1162
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,560
reason

1163
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,640
unless you want to push your own

1164
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,520
personal limits and i cannot

1165
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,760
condone doing free soloing i've never

1166
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,800
done it i

1167
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,920
i like my life and something really if

1168
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,599
if a minor thing goes wrong the

1169
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,520
consequences are really bad so

1170
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,480
i can't in any way uh say that you

1171
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,599
should go out in free solo

1172
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,839
all right i think that's all the

1173
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,599
questions that we've got from the chat

1174
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,200
if anyone else has any questions just

1175
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,799
pop them into the slack channel

1176
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,400
i did see your questions around the

1177
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,480
types of fun uh do we still have a few

1178
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,359
minutes

1179
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,200
yeah we've got about six minutes uh take

1180
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,560
your time perfect

1181
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,280
so uh i saw here that um a friend of

1182
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,960
mine just uh asked me to

1183
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,960
talk about types of fun hi jeff um

1184
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,119
types of fun there's a climber called

1185
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,240
kelly cordes he's

1186
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,640
uh he could be a comedian he's one of

1187
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,079
the funniest person i've ever heard talk

1188
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:10,880
first of all

1189
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,240
uh alpine climbing to kelly cordes is

1190
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,079
the reason you wake up early i'll give

1191
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,680
you the real reason why you wake up

1192
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,520
early to go alpine climbing

1193
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,520
it's because there's a lot of hanging

1194
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
ice and stuff that can fall down so you

1195
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,000
wake up

1196
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
really really early you start the

1197
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,119
climbing in the middle of the night and

1198
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,839
by the time the sun shines on the face

1199
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,880
you should be off the face or

1200
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,760
pretty safe kelly cordes says that the

1201
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,040
reason you wake up early to go

1202
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,440
alpine climbing is because by the time

1203
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,680
you wake up you're halfway up the cliff

1204
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,520
and you're it's too late for you to turn

1205
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,880
around by the time you get to your

1206
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,680
senses

1207
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,160
it's too late and you can't turn around

1208
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,280
anymore so that's why we

1209
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,480
we take off early funny guy uh

1210
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,119
he's got a theory on the types of fun uh

1211
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,240
three types of fun

1212
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,640
type one fun is fun while you're doing

1213
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,599
it it's

1214
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,560
drinking a good cup of coffee it's

1215
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,240
drinking one of your favorite adult

1216
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,800
beverages on a sunny patio it's fun

1217
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,720
you wake up the next well maybe not wake

1218
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,160
up the next morning and it's still fun

1219
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,720
but

1220
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,880
um it's always going to be fun as you're

1221
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,640
doing it type 2 fun

1222
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,200
is when you go out and it's not that

1223
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,240
great

1224
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,920
you know you're suffering um it's not

1225
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
uh you know childbirth could be

1226
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,520
considered type 2 fun because when you

1227
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,680
wake up the next day or a week later you

1228
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,319
think back

1229
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,480
fondly on the experience while you were

1230
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,640
having that experience it's not great

1231
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,599
but um afterwards when you when you

1232
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,480
reflect on it

1233
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,800
it was fun and type 3 fun is just never

1234
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,079
fun it's breaking your hand

1235
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,680
it's like you look back on it you go

1236
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,359
like yeah that sucked

1237
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,400
but climbing and you know

1238
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,640
sometimes hacking is a lot of type 2 fun

1239
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,240
while you're doing it you're frustrated

1240
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,280
you're hurting

1241
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,440
you're suffering but then you look back

1242
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,119
on it and it was worth it

1243
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,680
so i i definitely like to live in the

1244
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,200
type 2 fun

1245
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,400
place awesome so final question have you

1246
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
ever done any spelunking

1247
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,240
splunking no i haven't had the chance to

1248
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,000
go spelunking um

1249
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,079
though it is very interesting to me

1250
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,319
again the systems are interesting

1251
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,520
uh the anchors setting up the systems

1252
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,800
using the right nuts in the right

1253
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,240
situation and using all the equipment

1254
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,200
would be a lot of fun

1255
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,359
i never had the chance to go spelunking

1256
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,280
while i think people do it around here

1257
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,880
uh for some reason it's not anything

1258
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,839
that i've ever had the chance to do

1259
