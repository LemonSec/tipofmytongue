i'm going to cover my path into

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,479
information security

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,119
and talk about how it can be beneficial

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,320
for others

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,600
and and what lies out there for those

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,799
actually outside of security and within

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,759
to take advantage of this this possible

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,560

all the time in security and uh and

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280

slowly um and listen to a little bit of

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,600
the experience that i've had but

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,119

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,759
before we jump right in

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,919
okay so as it's titled run

56
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,319
towards the fire right so the fire we're

57
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,760
going to be talking about today

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,720
is of course the equifax breach that was

59
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,440
announced

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,040
in september of 2017 probably to most

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,000
people's awareness

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,239
and attracted over the next year or so

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,920
as it developed

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,800
uh in the media and in responses and in

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,360
the

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,640
security community at large right so the

67
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,000
fire that occurred

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,280
was that september's 2017

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,519
uh just announcement the breach happened

70
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,599
before but in september is when

71
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,239
equifax kind of came out and said hey we

72
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,920
have this problem there was a date of

73
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,640
breach

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
now i'm not going to spend time today

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,319
talking about the hows the what's the

76
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,920
whys and and who

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,400
who you know was on the offending end of

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,440
this breach

79
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,040
right that's not really kind of the

80
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,120
purpose of what we're honing in on here

81
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,640
but i do want to know for those who are

82
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,800
interested in in kind of the

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,840
metrics and the deep analysis of it

84
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,560
there is a u.s house of representatives

85
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,760
put out a

86
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,239
uh is the committee for on oversight and

87
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,319
government reform put out a report for

88
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,519
the equifax breach

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,560
back in december of 2018 just over a

90
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,239
year after the announcement with all of

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,360
the findings

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,879
so i encourage anybody who wants to

93
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,879
learn more about what happened

94
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,400
where the lapses were what was corrected

95
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,440
and how the actual breach occurred

96
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
to go out there and find that again

97
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,920
that's all u.s house of representatives

98
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,560
put out the report in december 2018. you

99
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,599
should be able to

100
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,959
probably find it off of that bit of

101
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,799
information uh

102
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,159
so the fire again back to that

103
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,720
equifax was receiving a lot of heat and

104
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,000
a lot of attention

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,080
and so much so that it was actually

106
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,200
voted the most

107
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,640
hated company in the united states

108
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,959
shortly after the breach announcement

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:03:59,760
and

110
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,080
everywhere you looked in september and

111
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,000
that last part 2017

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,879
you were seeing headlines and titles and

113
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,519
and people

114
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,000
demanding investigations be done and

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,080
rightfully so by governing bodies to

116
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,799
figure out

117
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,720
again what happened and how to correct

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,920
it so

119
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,478
all eyes on equifax at that time of the

120
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,279
year

121
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,800
right everybody i liken it to you've got

122
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,320
unfortunately you have a house in your

123
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
neighborhood who's on fire

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,440
and you have everyone in the

125
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,120
neighborhood looking at it wondering

126
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,080
what's going on

127
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
what's happening inside the house how

128
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,440
did this happen

129
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,600
and what's gonna happen to my home as

130
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,919
well that's right next to it right

131
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,880
uh in a similar business or neighborhood

132
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,000
of work

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,440
right so we were losing some of the

134
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,280
public trust

135
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,400
we equifax in september

136
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,360
and that was again very detrimental to

137
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,400
the organization

138
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,680
right uh but like in a fire in real life

139
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,800
and a fire for for security fire

140
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,919
um you have individuals who run towards

141
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,759
the fire to try to put it out to try to

142
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,440
make things better and try to

143
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,639
rebuild and reestablish public trust

144
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,240
right so that's our scenario of fire

145
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,160
so in october of 2017

146
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,400
i did the weird thing of actually

147
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,759
accepting a job

148
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,960
at equifax less than maybe two weeks

149
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,400
after the breach announcement

150
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,280
a third party headhunter had contacted

151
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,039
me about a possible position

152
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,039
now as you'll note from the slide it's

153
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,639
not a security rule

154
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,880
it's a qa automation engineer which up

155
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,600
to that point was the primary

156
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,520
type of work that i had been doing both

157
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,720
in the private sector

158
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,440
and in government contracting so i had a

159
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
large amount of experience in that field

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
with uh with scripting some automation

161
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,520
for functional testing have some

162
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,080
development

163
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,720
background things like that but when

164
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,039
they contacted me they didn't initially

165
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,639
tell me what the company was

166
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,840
it was only after about a week of

167
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,919
dealing with the recruiter that

168
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,680
this third-party recruiter i said yes

169
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,120
i'm interested in that could you please

170
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,039
tell me the company that's actually for

171
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,919
as they try to

172
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,479
protect their commissions sometimes uh

173
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,759
so i swear

174
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,600
when i asked that question the recruiter

175
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,520
got real well on the phone

176
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,039
started to kind of whisper and she said

177
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,199
you know it's where i'm excited that

178
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,880
you're interested in the position but

179
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,280
you know it's the company is equifax i

180
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,039
swear she said it in a whisper

181
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,520
almost as if it would scare me off right

182
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,360
and probably a lot of

183
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,000
uh potential candidates did run at that

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,039
word

185
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,919
at the time uh so she's very reassuring

186
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,680
opened up to any information

187
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,360
so you know what let's first let's go

188
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,880
forward at this point

189
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,039
and let me hear what they have to say

190
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,440
let's see what's going on with equifax

191
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,720
um now a lot of my colleagues around

192
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,960
uh my area and people i've worked with

193
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,880
heard when i was pursuing something with

194
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,560
equifax and when i eventually took the

195
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
job and they said what have you done

196
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,639
you know always have thrown in in any

197
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,880
presentation a good star wars meme you

198
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,360
know

199
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,720
what have i done here uh when i

200
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,759
walked away from the recruiter it was

201
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,560
interesting because i kind of came back

202
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,280
at the

203
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,319
at that evening after the talk

204
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,360
and said you know this is a possibility

205
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
for a job i don't know much about the

206
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,120
company i did a little research

207
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
found they're much larger than i

208
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
actually knew they're way beyond

209
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
just the credit bureau that keeps track

210
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
of your score they're an international

211
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,759
conglomerate they're massive right

212
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,520
so i started thinking is this the right

213
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
career move as anybody should

214
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,919
when they're taking a new position and i

215
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,000
saw an opportunity

216
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,520
to actually change my area of focus

217
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,720
now everybody who kind of asked me about

218
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,440
this like i

219
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,919
like i said is what was the motivation

220
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,440
why would you

221
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,639
go to a company that is in this major

222
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,879
spotlight this is the hot seat right the

223
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,199
organization to every outside observer

224
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,120
is on fire they had a huge

225
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,080
data breach um what's going to happen in

226
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,800
the next

227
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,199
you know month the next six months the

228
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,520
next 10 years for this organization

229
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,319
right

230
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,919
and certainly a lot of a lot of

231
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,160
companies might not have a plan

232
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
for less than a month after they

233
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,759
announced breach

234
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,879
um so my answer has always been simple i

235
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,919
wanted to work

236
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,840
in security i always have uh i actually

237
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,199
came out of college

238
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,960
in 2007 and i tried to find

239
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,958
positions in security it was it was

240
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,559
interesting you know

241
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,799
field to me it was a lot that couldn't

242
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,679
be known

243
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,799
uh but probably

244
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,679
and arguably to the detriment of some uh

245
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,959
back in 2007

246
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,360
smartphones were barely a thing right

247
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,519
who is giving out cyber security degrees

248
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,959
as undergraduate degrees

249
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,279
so i left college with a regular cs

250
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,040
degree pursuing any fuel

251
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,760
any focus of work i could in the i.t

252
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,519
field

253
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,800
so without any

254
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,000
sort of flood of security opportunities

255
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,720
out there

256
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,760
i took the next big thing right go into

257
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,080
a

258
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,560
software development company who has a

259
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,080
product that's doing well

260
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,640
the hot things software development and

261
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,040
i bounced around different roles in that

262
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,959
in that area of focus for about a decade

263
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,760
uh with some successes some not so

264
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,480
successes

265
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,399
on the on the government side for

266
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,480
contracting and the private sector as

267
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,200
well but i

268
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
i bounced around there for about a

269
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
decade and i never really

270
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,440
felt like i was fulfilling what i wanted

271
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
to do

272
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,519
right so when i

273
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,360
sat down after speaking with the

274
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
recruiter i saw

275
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,240
that hey this company now has security

276
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
has a real focus

277
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,519
whereas at a pre-breach organization

278
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,000
you would have to fight and scrap and

279
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,480
argue for every dime that you could get

280
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,399
to try to do security work particularly

281
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,480
if you haven't been a security person in

282
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,200
the past

283
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,839
to try to convince higher ups to spend

284
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,680
the money

285
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,240
and i like to refer to to almost all

286
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,839
organizations as pre-breach

287
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,200
organizations primarily because no

288
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,519
organization government or private

289
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,519
sector or anything in between

290
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,640
is immune to a potential breach so

291
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,880
any time that there's an organization

292
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,399
that hasn't announced yet

293
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,320
to me they're just pre-breach

294
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,560
now the problem that you get with your

295
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,160
with your companies

296
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,720
that you may be at an hour or if you're

297
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,079
not doing security right and you want to

298
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,839
is they don't really see a return on

299
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,560
investment

300
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,839
it's hard to actually convince a

301
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,880
higher up that security will protect

302
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,160
their revenue streams

303
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,000
as it's not a thing in itself that

304
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,839
typically generates revenue

305
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,160
unless you are a security company and

306
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,079
that's what you do

307
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,399
so without that sort of return on

308
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,640
investment to motivate them

309
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
if you look out and see some of the

310
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,800
organizations that are post breach

311
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
you'll start to notice that they have an

312
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,959
increased focus

313
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,959
so here's some just some quick numbers

314
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,120
here real easy to pull i'm sure a lot of

315
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,320
you have have

316
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,720
uh heard of have i been pwned so i'm

317
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,560
going to give them a little bit of

318
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,440
of credit here uh they track breaches

319
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,640
that are typically

320
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,959
announced and verified and things like

321
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,800
that and i'm just going to lay out here

322
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,279
real quick what the past five years have

323
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,640
looked like

324
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,920
so have i been pwned the top numbers uh

325
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,839
over the years here and the years being

326
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,200
in circles

327
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,680
are the amount of breaches that occurred

328
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,079
that year as tracked by the havoc and

329
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,600
ponce site

330
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
uh and down below are some of the more

331
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,519
notable ones that you might want to pay

332
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,120
attention to

333
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,760
the reason i draw this distinction is

334
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
there are a lot of organizations being

335
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,959
breached

336
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,680
according to the have i've been owned

337
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
data from the last five years

338
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,800
there are about 64 breaches a year per

339
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,600
year

340
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,320
for the last five that breaks down to

341
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,800
about

342
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,959
five breaches a month a little over

343
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,440
actually uh the math's not quite right

344
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,040
a little over five so you're talking

345
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,639
about a breach occurring

346
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,680
every week of the year on average

347
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,040
for the last five years so the game is

348
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,920
out there

349
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,399
right organizations are breaching now a

350
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,600
lot of these numbers that have them

351
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,880
opponent you're going to see them as

352
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,079
being

353
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,000
these companies you don't know very well

354
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,160
they're data aggregation companies they

355
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
pull in information they

356
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,279
they buy up your personal data

357
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,519
they tie it together they help resell it

358
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,600
for targeted ads

359
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,560
that and that work is you know a revenue

360
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,000
builder

361
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,480
but you might not want to look at those

362
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,200
companies

363
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,120
after they breach a lot of times they

364
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,639
just vanish into thin air

365
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,279
they disappear or they've been gone for

366
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,800
a while and it's just comes to light

367
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,200
that their data was taken

368
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,680
down below are some of the more notable

369
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,360
organizations that you might want to pay

370
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
attention to if you consider

371
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,320
this path in the security or this switch

372
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,040
of course you

373
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,279
you see way back in 2016 you've got

374
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,200
organizations like linkedin

375
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,720
the dnc and the nsa right there

376
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,880
so remember a couple slides ago i said

377
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,240
no organization

378
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,120
is immune to a breach even the nsa had a

379
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,959
security incident

380
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,519
and of course you'll see equifax in 2017

381
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,880
with some companies

382
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,279
uh things like starwood things like

383
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,480
capital one

384
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,920
even the the awesome words with friends

385
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,279
and movie pass

386
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,440
organizations right and then all the way

387
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,760
down to more recently you have

388
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
in 2020 right at the end december the

389
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,199
announcement of the solarwinds breach

390
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,440
now that's a that's a whole different

391
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,399
type of game

392
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,160
it's like a supply chain attack but it's

393
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,600
still a security incident

394
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,000
it still requires a security response

395
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,440
so in consideration when you

396
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,920
may be approached by a recruiter who

397
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,880
wants to

398
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,000
bring you in to an organization that is

399
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,199
post breach

400
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,120
you want to look at a few things you

401
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,399
don't want to jump at the

402
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,240
organizations that might be on shaky

403
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,160
ground only been around for a couple

404
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,880
years

405
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,959
so you want to look at that longevity of

406
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,720
the organization has it been around a

407
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,839
long time

408
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,880
right um when i went back

409
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,160
after that recruiter came to me and i

410
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,839
tried to decide whether or not i wanted

411
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,199
to take a position

412
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,600
inside of a post-breach organization i

413
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,199
decided security is what i

414
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,279
i've been wanting to do for a long time

415
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,839
it was a risky move

416
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,839
but it was a measured and calculated

417
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,600
risk i

418
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
had a conversation with my wife that

419
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,519
night and say you know what if i do this

420
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,560
there is risk

421
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,279
but i i guarantee i'm going to be doing

422
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,440
security work within six months to a

423
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,079
year

424
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,720
that was my goal and within three months

425
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,000
the application

426
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,480
development team i was on approached me

427
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,040
to do some more of the security work

428
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,920
now since then i've taken on a lot of

429
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,519
different roles

430
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,240
i've actually i've gone from a qa

431
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,160
automation engineer to more of an

432
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,000
application security engineer

433
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,320
doing some and then on to devsecops type

434
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,440
of work

435
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,600
i shifted over and did some security

436
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,839
platforms and operations work with a lot

437
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,160
of scripting a lot of automation

438
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,839
and now i'm currently within our

439
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,000
internal pen testing team

440
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,240
so there's a couple things in those few

441
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,920
bullet points that are really important

442
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,079
when you make these considerations

443
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,480
and that is when they approached me

444
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,639
forced to take on security work

445
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,440
i made sure to have a conversation right

446
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,880
up front to say

447
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,360
i want proper training i need to make

448
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,440
sure that security budget

449
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,399
is in place as a general business

450
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:50,959
function

451
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,199
how is that looking what does the

452
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,120
timeline look out for funding that you

453
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,199
figured out so far

454
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,120
and then the that ability to shift

455
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,399
around as i mentioned

456
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,399
now that's actually really important and

457
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,560
that's why i said at the beginning

458
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,639
that even if you're in security right

459
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,120
now this may be a possibility for you

460
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,959
is that's real hard to change up your

461
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,600
jobs i'd never done security before i

462
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,279
had no business taking a security

463
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,199
position but i found an avenue in that

464
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,759
allowed me to use my existing skill set

465
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,320
and then shift over to something else

466
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,079
and those positions i just listed out

467
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,000
some of them are more boutique

468
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,079
i decided i wanted to go more red i

469
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,600
wanted to be on the offensive side the

470
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,800
pen testing side

471
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,040
and eventually i got there you kind of

472
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,560
you get an opportunity to figure out

473
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,519
what you love what you want to do

474
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,880
now the need is out there

475
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,399
right and this is this is super

476
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,160
important because

477
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,560
as i've told people this over the past

478
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,440
several years

479
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
when they when i get asked is what are

480
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,040
you doing security how did you get in

481
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,279
how did you break that barrier

482
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,120
these organizations that i've been

483
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,360
talking about this whole time

484
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,240
they are in desperate need of security

485
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,639
right

486
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,920
their house is on fire they have had a

487
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,280
serious incident and they they need

488
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,839
security you can be one of the

489
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,679
individuals who chooses to

490
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,119
run towards that fire and help not only

491
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,559
your own career

492
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,959
but to help the organization and by

493
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,079
doing so

494
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,919
you're also getting the opportunity to

495
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,640
help a lot of other people that consume

496
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,799
the business services and functions that

497
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,640
that organization provides

498
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,240
so equifax for instance is one of three

499
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,840
major credit bureaus

500
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,720
right they service millions of people

501
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
and track their information

502
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,559
if you have a similar organization that

503
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,080
goes through a breach

504
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,480
you going to organization and bringing

505
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,000
your specific skill

506
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,520
set from your past can help everybody

507
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,240
it can really help propel you forward

508
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,600
and that's something you should really

509
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,400
consider

510
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,720
not in a selfish way to just advance

511
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,919
your own career

512
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,880
but in a way that helps bring more skill

513
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,400
sets to the field

514
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,240
so that's a big benefit that i want to

515
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,160
hit as one of the last notes here

516
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,640
in this section is the benefit to

517
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,600
security

518
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,840
is the broad knowledge that so many

519
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,280
people come in with

520
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,679
there's been so many stories about how

521
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,640
they how these

522
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,880
unorthodox approaches into security as i

523
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,320
mentioned there was no real

524
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,200
security degrees you know not that long

525
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,000
ago

526
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,360
it's only recently that people are

527
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,440
getting security education

528
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,160
at an undergraduate and master's level

529
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,960
type of

530
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,240
type of level um so when you come

531
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,280
in and you take these routes these

532
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,559
these un uncommon you know

533
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,280
pathless travel type of routes you are

534
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,720
bringing in a skill set

535
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,440
that you know conferences like this love

536
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,640
to hear about

537
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,160
people will enjoy to hear your

538
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
experience coming into security and it

539
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,400
will motivate them to do the same

540
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,480
and that's something that we need the

541
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,880
organization's post-breach need

542
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,160
and that just in general uh

543
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,919
the the entire kind of social aspect

544
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,919
of where things are in the world needs

545
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,000
more security

546
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,080
so with that that was i know that was a

547
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,840
lot to consume

548
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,760
we're going to move on to the second

549
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,400
section of my talk

550
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,880
and that is stroke awareness and

551
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,919
detection so before i talked about

552
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,720
yeah here's how my career progressed

553
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,080
that was a big risk

554
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,919
and a personal path that i measured um

555
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,120
measured my approach to to make a change

556
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,880
right this next section i'm going to

557
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,640
share with you some information that is

558
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,760
that is very

559
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,120
personal um that uh

560
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,880
i do have a very it's impacted me very

561
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,000
very closely and i hope that by the

562
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,520
end of this section you will have a

563
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,120
greater awareness

564
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,160
and a greater sense of uh

565
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,600
detection right for to steal my own

566
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,080
title

567
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,120
right so right into it my personal story

568
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,559
uh my wife michelle on july 11th

569
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,480
of 2016 was 29 years old

570
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,600
not old you know very young

571
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,720
and she suffered from an ischemic stroke

572
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,400
to the right portion of her pawns

573
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,080
there's a few things in that first

574
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,760
bullet point that i'm going to draw

575
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,159
out during this during this talk to try

576
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,919
to to try to highlight

577
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,039
first is that the age she was

578
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,320
the type of stroke and what a stroke is

579
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,440
and where it can impact things

580
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,280
so first off alligator ischemic stroke

581
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,880
is actually it's 87 of all strokes that

582
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,840
occur

583
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,760
it is when the blood supply to the brain

584
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,080
in any section of the brain is

585
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,280
obstructed

586
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,919
typically this occurs with a clot uh

587
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,039
it's just a

588
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,520
just blocks that blood flow which of

589
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,360
course stops the oxygen

590
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,760
flowing to that part of the brain and

591
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,360
with any part of the body that can be

592
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,120
extremely dangerous and it's

593
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,280
amplified to the nth degree when it

594
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,360
occurs in the brain

595
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,159
uh so her area where this occurred was

596
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,919
the pons which is

597
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,240
actually it's the largest part of the

598
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,000
brain stem

599
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,440
it controls so many things uh it

600
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,480
controls

601
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,440
things like the respiratory rhythm of

602
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,400
your breathing

603
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,760
it controls the fundamental uh

604
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,480
rem sleep cycles that you get every

605
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,760
night

606
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,240
but it also and maybe even more

607
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,600
importantly

608
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,320
it acts as a funnel for all the other

609
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,440
communications of the

610
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,159
upper areas of your brain to communicate

611
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:50,720
with

612
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,360
any areas of your body whether that's

613
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,159
conscious

614
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,280
or unconscious motor functions

615
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,320
or just base level activities that your

616
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,799
body

617
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,919
carries out right um

618
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,159
and then if you are trying to wrap your

619
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,080
head around it a little bit

620
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,840
think of the pawns as like the router of

621
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,960
your network right inside of your brain

622
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,559
your upper brain

623
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,440
all of your devices inside of your home

624
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,360
network are carrying out specific

625
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,600
functions and they're trying to reach

626
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,120
outside the network

627
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,200
all of that funnels right through the

628
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,320
pawns

629
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,760
and then goes out to the rest of the

630
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,679
body and there's also

631
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,280
the choke point of all the

632
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,120
communications coming back up to the

633
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,840
brain

634
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,559
so pons is particularly dangerous if uh

635
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,480
if a stroke occurs there

636
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,240
now i have highlight a couple of these

637
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,760
next points uh

638
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,240
because it's important and it drives on

639
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,200
why you need awareness in this subject

640
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,159
she got attention almost immediately

641
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,559
medical attention

642
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,080
even with that the hospital did not

643
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,120
check for a stroke until after

644
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,120
seven hours in care now there's a lot of

645
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,960
reasons why that happened

646
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,000
uh she did not have any high risk

647
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
major risk things that would elevate the

648
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,600
likelihood she was having a stroke

649
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,159
she was not obese she did not have smoke

650
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,000
she wasn't a drinker she had no family

651
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,280
history of stroke

652
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,760
at all and all of those things led them

653
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,360
in the direction to check for things

654
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,000
like

655
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,080
it has to be something with her lungs or

656
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,320
her heart or something else is off in

657
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,640
her

658
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,000
balance of of of nutrients or something

659
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,080
so they spent a long time checking for

660
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,000
that

661
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,039
in hindsight knowing what i know now

662
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,840
she was exhibiting several signs of a

663
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,559
stroke

664
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,400
right from the beginning and that

665
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,840
worsened over time

666
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,960
so hopefully this will help uh

667
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,039
illuminate what you know about strokes

668
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,480
now here's a little cross section this

669
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,400
is this is my wife's brain

670
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,320
taken not long after the stroke this is

671
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,640
an mri image of two cross sections

672
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,799
where that yellow line is on the left

673
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,080
image goes right through where she

674
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,320
had her stroke that's right where the

675
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,679
pawns is

676
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,159
so everything above is all that brain

677
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,840
that upper brain function

678
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,799
uh specific areas handling very specific

679
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,080
things in your body

680
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,440
but at the ponds you can kind of see

681
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,760
where it narrows down until it gets to

682
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,799
the spinal cord

683
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,919
at the at the base of the brainstem

684
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,159
so that's what i meant when i said all

685
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,000
the thought goes through there

686
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,919
and on the image on the right what you

687
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,720
can see is these are single mri slices

688
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,480
of imagery and

689
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,520
you'll see a sort of brightened spot

690
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,080
that's in that center of the image on

691
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,039
the right

692
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,360
and it covers almost all of that side

693
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,240
now these are

694
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,400
these are mri images so they are flipped

695
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
so what you're looking at on the left

696
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,520
side is actually the right side of her

697
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,200
brain but

698
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,400
that whole area lost blood supply

699
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,159
lost oxygen for a significant period of

700
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,120
time

701
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,960
and that highlighted area on there is

702
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,039
actually represent representation of

703
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,080
dead tissue it doesn't take long for

704
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,559
your

705
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,559
for your brain tissue to die if it's

706
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,400
starved of oxygen

707
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,440
very short period of time so i'm going

708
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,080
to

709
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,679
show you this image so you get an idea

710
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,400
of where these things occur

711
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
and what it can look like on an mri so

712
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,240
it can be very impactful as a lot of

713
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,320
people know the right side of your brain

714
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,159
and the brain stem controls the left

715
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,320
side of your body and vice versa

716
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,000
so that level of impact in that area of

717
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,720
her brain

718
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,279
impacted almost her entire body on the

719
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,919
left side

720
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,559
so i said that there was a highlight on

721
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,400
that first slide of this section from

722
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,640
from what happened to to michelle my

723
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,279
wife said she was 29 years old

724
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,640
uh it's important to realize that

725
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,679
stroke has no age wants there is no such

726
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,120
thing as i'm too young

727
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,600
i'm too young to be having a stroke or

728
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,279
he's too young to be

729
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,679
experiencing these symptoms strokes

730
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:00,799
actually happen

731
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,320
in children and infants not

732
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,720
not i'm not trying to raise fire alarms

733
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,679
or anything like that

734
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,159
but they do happen that's i don't want

735
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,520
to say it's the most

736
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,960
occurrences but in 2009 one of the

737
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,799
studies from cdc american stroke

738
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,799
association they were 34

739
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,120
of all people hospitalized from stroke

740
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,360
were under the age of 65.

741
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,039
i guarantee you talk to most people and

742
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,640
they think

743
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,360
they strokes happen to older people and

744
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
strokes happen people with uh

745
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,120
with a lot of of risk factors associated

746
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
with it right

747
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,400
that might amplify that that thinking

748
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,000
right but a third of all the strokes

749
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,840
happen under that 65 age cap and a

750
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,320
little warning sign in here i am in the

751
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,640
southeast of the united states

752
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,279
uh it is the country's highest death

753
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:55,919
rates

754
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,120
for strokes so if you if you want to see

755
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,400
some heat maps on where these things

756
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,919
occur just as a little bit more of that

757
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,360
deeper data dive

758
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,039
uh the cdc and the american stroke

759
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,960
association they have

760
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,880
a lot of these heat maps a lot of this

761
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,039
this raw data that you can consume

762
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,520
i really encourage each and every one of

763
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,799
you to go out there and take a look at

764
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,200
these

765
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,720
resources i promise you

766
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,279
if it is happening to somebody you love

767
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,720
or somebody

768
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,039
at your workplace you are not going to

769
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,640
have the time

770
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,520
to go and look these things up all right

771
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,960
even a cursory

772
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,000
awareness of these of these things

773
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,960
is enough to help somebody tremendously

774
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,559
so i want to move forward into one of

775
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,880
the stroke

776
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,000
identification methods that are out

777
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,279
there and

778
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,360
a lot of these things attract with with

779
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,679
good acronyms so that you can

780
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,720
remember what to do and some sort of a

781
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,240
word association

782
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,559
um so i'll walk through this a little

783
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,520
bit and this graph is on dukehealth.org

784
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,960
if you want to take a look at that they

785
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
have some great resources

786
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,399
on that site as well regarding stroke

787
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,600
but the main areas to focus on for if

788
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,679
someone's having a stroke

789
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,880
and how to detect it is be

790
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,120
balanced right if somebody is suddenly

791
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,600
very unbalanced if they can't stand at

792
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,200
all or even if they're just a little

793
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,159
dizzy

794
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,200
right that's one indicator that

795
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
they may be having a stroke now you can

796
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,320
say very easily

797
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,760
that well a lot of things make you dizzy

798
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,679
and that's true what you want to look

799
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,240
for that heightens the probability

800
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,919
that somebody's having a stroke is if

801
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,320
they start to exhibit several of these

802
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,120
the second one is eyes where a person

803
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,520
might

804
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,279
suddenly lose vision in one or both eyes

805
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,960
or actually become just disoriented

806
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,640
they're unable to focus they get they

807
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
have double vision

808
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,080
so it can present itself in a few

809
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,399
different ways i know this slide

810
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,320
focuses on if they lost vision

811
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,600
completely

812
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,720
the truth is a number of individuals

813
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,799
before they have their full on stroke

814
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,880
have series of mini strokes leading up

815
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,039
to it where the clot may be traveling

816
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,559
and dislodging and lodging

817
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,720
along the way and can produce these

818
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,919
symptoms

819
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,919
in in a lesser way or periodically

820
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,880
the third one is f for face now what

821
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,559
you're going to want to look for there

822
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,399
is try to have somebody that may be

823
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,919
experiencing these things

824
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,520
to smile or to raise their eyebrows up

825
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,240
if one side of their mouth refuses to

826
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,039
raise up

827
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,760
the muscles aren't really reacting or if

828
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,679
an eyebrow is not going all the way up

829
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,520
to this to the height of the other

830
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,720
that's a very serious indicator that

831
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,480
their muscles are not receiving the

832
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,640
neural impul impulses

833
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,120
from the brain to perform a function

834
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,320
that is normally done

835
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,600
in unison across a face uh so

836
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,240
and the fourth one is arms this is this

837
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,080
is important here as well i'm

838
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,760
say it's important these are all very

839
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,240
important arms what you're going to do

840
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,120
with someone

841
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,360
is tell them to put their arms straight

842
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,279
out if they're laying down that's fine

843
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,039
too put their arms flat

844
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,120
and try raising them up at the same at

845
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,720
the same rate

846
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,679
and what you'll find is again if the

847
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,159
brain

848
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,600
is suffering from this level of trauma

849
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,919
it's not sending those neural impulses

850
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:28,960
to the muscles

851
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,440
to respond it's not a question of muscle

852
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,679
weakness it's a question of

853
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,600
receiving the signals to do an action

854
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,000
so if somebody's having an issue with

855
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,200
their arms and it can even just be

856
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,279
numbness like i said

857
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,679
numbness on its own is not cause for

858
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,360
concern usually you're going to look for

859
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,320
pairings of these conditions now

860
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,600
the fifth one on here for speech

861
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,200
is probably stands out the most

862
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,440
right so all of these ones leading up to

863
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,640
this these are actions that you're

864
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,519
perceiving

865
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,600
physically the speech pathway

866
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,039
that ha that is impacted by a stroke is

867
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,640
one of the most apparent that you can

868
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,240
have it is

869
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,159
slurred speech a person's inability to

870
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:16,880
focus

871
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,600
to find the right words to describe how

872
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,960
they're feeling

873
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,559
um and that can progress

874
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,799
over time now i i've called back

875
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,720
progressing over time a couple a couple

876
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,080
times here and i'm going to tell you

877
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,720
why you know in a little bit uh but

878
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,519
first

879
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,760
t is time and this one is nothing to do

880
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,600
with the person's conditions

881
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,720
it is just to emphasize that the best

882
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,559
thing you can do for somebody who may be

883
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,080
having a stroke

884
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,200
is rapidly call the first responders

885
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,919
that you have

886
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,799
the emts get an ambulance and get them

887
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,279
to

888
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,360
some medical care as quickly as you can

889
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,559
and this again this is not about it's a

890
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:00,880
t

891
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
there for specif specific emphasis

892
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,720
because the treatments

893
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,600
that a hospital can provide to someone

894
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,880
having a stroke

895
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,039
will reduce based on how long you wait

896
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,440
and the best example of this is there's

897
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,039
something called a tpa

898
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,399
injection tpa and what that is is it's

899
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,080
like a super clot buster

900
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,120
it's like a it's like a blood thinner it

901
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,919
ramped up

902
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,960
211 right and what they use this

903
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,640
for is to is to give that injection and

904
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,080
to try to break up whatever

905
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,240
is stopping that blood flow and that

906
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,519
oxygen supply

907
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,799
to your brain now i say this with the

908
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,760
time

909
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,919
because there is a time limitation on

910
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,279
this a tpa

911
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,600
shot or injection can only be given

912
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,399
within the first

913
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,039
three or four and a half hours of when

914
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,640
stroke symptoms

915
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,000
start so if you're at home

916
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,159
and it takes you two hours to get to the

917
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,000
hospital because you waited a little

918
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
while or it's traffic or for whatever

919
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,720
reason

920
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,480
if you start falling outside of that

921
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,480
window hospitals will not take the risk

922
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,039
now there's other limiting factors as

923
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:11,760
well

924
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,720
um if you are on any sort of blood

925
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,360
thinners

926
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,960
for regular reasons any at all

927
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,039
a hospital will be very hesitant to give

928
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,120
you a tpa shot as well

929
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,120
and this has to do with it's it's going

930
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,960
to double up on that blood thinning

931
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,840
activity

932
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,000
and this can unfortunately lead in some

933
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,039
cases to

934
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,720
additional instead of blockage of blood

935
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,279
and actual internal bleed this could

936
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,960
result in a brain bleed

937
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,000
because they're trying to break that

938
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,159
clot up and it reacts with medication

939
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,200
you're on for

940
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,519
some other regular condition that you're

941
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,320
usually

942
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,000
taking now you may say why have this

943
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,240
injection if you can never use it the

944
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,880
fact is

945
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,279
for younger people they tend to shy away

946
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:55,919
a little bit

947
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,679
but that's again under understanding

948
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,640
that most strokes occur in the older age

949
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,440
group

950
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,919
right and when someone's older and less

951
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:04,559
able to

952
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,799
bounce back or recover the risks of

953
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,320
giving them an injection

954
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,520
that may have side effects start to

955
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,239
lessen the benefits are better to save a

956
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,440
person's life

957
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,960
than to potentially do some harm

958
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,639
right and that's a call for the

959
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,560
physician to make for the hospital for

960
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,839
their risk

961
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,239
but you increase those options the

962
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,639
faster you react

963
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,239
so i said how in a few of these

964
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,239
it may be combinations it may be uh

965
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,119
developed over time and there are a lot

966
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,960
of people who experience mini strokes

967
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,679
before

968
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,639
their primary main stroke that occurs

969
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,879
this was the case with my wife

970
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,280
at the time she was working on a

971
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,159
military

972
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,520
base uh in our town now that base is

973
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,480
locked off

974
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,239
you need identification to get on you

975
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,160
need to be able to access it

976
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,480
she was at work in the morning and she

977
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,800
started experiencing immediately

978
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,839
she experienced b e and

979
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,520
s she experienced three out of five

980
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,280
of the indicators that she was having a

981
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,720
stroke

982
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,119
but nobody really picked up on it she

983
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,320
was laying on the floor

984
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,920
thankfully co-workers were there they

985
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,000
immediately called me mt

986
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,640
but you have to be aware of these and

987
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,720
try to spread it beyond just you and

988
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,760
your family

989
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,040
because you may not be there i

990
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,960
physically couldn't access my wife when

991
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,920
she had her first series of strokes

992
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,800
at the office on the base that i didn't

993
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,240
have access to

994
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,400
thankfully i had worked on there before

995
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,320
and i had contact with people who were

996
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,280
on there

997
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,760
and a friend escorted me on the base but

998
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,599
i still couldn't enter the building

999
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,000
so it was entirely up to these

1000
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,440
co-workers

1001
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,960
to identify this but also the emts more

1002
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,920
importantly

1003
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,240
and i think i'm thankful that the

1004
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,760
co-workers were there and act

1005
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,920
and called the medical professionals

1006
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,200
immediately

1007
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,240
it it did a lot for her but once she was

1008
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,839
in the emt's care

1009
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,680
she was already exhibiting three out of

1010
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,040
five of the signs she was having a

1011
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,599
stroke

1012
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,119
and still they didn't pick up that it

1013
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:15,839
was a stroke

1014
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,520
because she didn't have risk factors

1015
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,680
that would put her in those categories

1016
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,839
they weren't looking for it because it

1017
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,520
was unlikely

1018
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,960
right now the symptoms over time

1019
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,119
as we were in the hospital and they were

1020
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,200
getting ready to discharge my wife

1021
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,280
when they said start packing up go home

1022
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,800
we checked your chest your heart

1023
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,560
you know everything looks okay we don't

1024
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,320
know why you're dizzy

1025
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,440
she started developing face

1026
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,960
and arm weakness it was only then that

1027
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,000
we said hey you know

1028
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,720
she can't lift her left arm she oh she

1029
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,079
might be groggy because of the med to

1030
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:50,800
put no

1031
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,400
she can't lift her she can lift her

1032
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,560
right arm fine and i didn't even know

1033
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,720
what we were looking at it then

1034
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,240
and the hospital eventually said you

1035
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,240
know what let's start imaging her brain

1036
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,560
to see if there's something there and it

1037
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,920
was only then

1038
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,000
after hours well outside of the window

1039
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,079
of tpa injections

1040
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,400
and sitting around in a hospital for a

1041
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,240
long time that we actually

1042
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,118
got some attention

1043
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,960
now we're winding down here

1044
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,640
getting close to the end of the talk but

1045
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,000
i wanted to highlight

1046
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,960
some of the aftermath of a stroke all

1047
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,280
right

1048
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,839
so to kind of prepare you if god forbid

1049
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,079
somebody in your family or somebody in

1050
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,839
your friends or work

1051
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,240
has a stroke as to what they may be

1052
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,200
dealing with

1053
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,160
and what if you are that support person

1054
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,320
should be prepared to deal with

1055
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,880
number one is all strokes have lasting

1056
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,000
effects

1057
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,119
there is no such thing no such thing

1058
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,680
as a full recovery from a stroke

1059
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,440
i say that again there's no such thing

1060
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,960
as a full recovery

1061
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,320
they may get close they may appear well

1062
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,960
and they may be able to do a lot but

1063
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,599
there is

1064
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,200
no going back to that pre-stroke state

1065
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,400
there's just not it didn't have

1066
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,240
it can have uh it can manifest in a lot

1067
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,880
of ways right what those lasting effects

1068
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,079
may be

1069
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,560
for example example memory issues right

1070
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,240
to an outside observer

1071
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,119
memory issues is not very apparent right

1072
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,560
you may not know

1073
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,480
uh there can be lasting weakness and

1074
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,240
again it's not a question

1075
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,000
of muscular atrophy or anything like

1076
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,119
that in some cases they may just

1077
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,480
lack the neural impulses in order to

1078
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,280
talk to anything right to stimulate the

1079
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,240
muscles to

1080
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,960
to do that contraction or that relaxed

1081
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,359
motion that they require

1082
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,079
and in a very real way a lot of stroke

1083
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,480
a lot of stroke survivors they they

1084
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,560
suffer from ptsd

1085
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,359
right imagine that you're experiencing

1086
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,119
some of these symptoms you start to get

1087
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,160
a little dizzy

1088
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,720
you start to feel faint things like that

1089
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
and it turns out you had a stroke

1090
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,760
right and you've got to go through this

1091
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,839
long painful recovery process

1092
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,560
anytime you start to feel that same way

1093
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,200
that

1094
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,800
whole experience is gonna flood back to

1095
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,880
you that whole fear you're gonna

1096
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,440
you can relive it over and over none of

1097
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,440
these things i've listed out

1098
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,119
are readily apparent from an outside

1099
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,200
observer and i'm really

1100
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,560
pushing on on these points because

1101
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,720
it's so important when you're talking to

1102
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,680
a stroke survivor to be aware of this

1103
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,760
when a stroke happens and a piece of the

1104
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,720
brain tissue dies even as thin as an mri

1105
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,640
slice across a cross section of the

1106
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,320
brain the brain must

1107
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,200
try to reform and create new neural

1108
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,000
pathways

1109
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
to perform the functions that it can no

1110
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,480
longer communicate to the body

1111
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,760
that level of success can vary wildly

1112
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,839
and it requires a lot of intense focused

1113
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,160
care so

1114
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,119
for my wife's in situation she spent 16

1115
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,079
days in the er

1116
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,359
the icu and in patient rehab relearning

1117
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,240
the basic

1118
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,640
daily living actions like walking and

1119
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,720
making food and grabbing utensils for

1120
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,520
their releaser

1121
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,000
even after that months of outpatient

1122
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,839
rehab therapy

1123
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,920
so when you are talking to somebody who

1124
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,200
had a stroke

1125
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,800
i know you might be coming from a very

1126
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,960
supportive and encouraging way but when

1127
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,359
you

1128
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,160
might say you look great you look like

1129
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,680
you fully recovered

1130
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,319
please be aware that you may not be

1131
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:31,040
seeing

1132
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,520
all of the impacts the stroke really had

1133
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,640
as a lasting effect

1134
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,560
on that individual so with that

1135
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,599
that's the end of part two for me um

1136
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,200
i hope that you learned something i hope

1137
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,240
you enjoyed both some career information

1138
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,000
and experience as well as learn

1139
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,280
something for awareness

1140
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,480
for uh for stroke this is me here on

1141
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,400
twitter twitter if you

1142
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,960
want to follow me you'll get a lot of

1143
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,599
retweets or replies with star wars gifs

1144
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,760
i promise you that much

1145
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,920
but thank you for attending i really

1146
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,760
appreciate you taking the time

1147
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,920
and listening and again i hope you

1148
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,200
learned something

1149
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,960
thanks a lot and thank you chris for

1150
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,839
helping us out with that information

1151
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,040
during the

1152
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,680
second portion of your talk especially

1153
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,920
there was a lot of talk in the chat

1154
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,720
channels

1155
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,000
from uh several people actually who had

1156
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,680
experienced strokes

1157
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,720
or who had close family who had

1158
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,319
also experienced strokes as well

1159
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,880
very critical and important information

1160
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,319
on how to recognize them

1161
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,680
and on the criticality of time so i

1162
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,880
thank you very much for

1163
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,839
for this
