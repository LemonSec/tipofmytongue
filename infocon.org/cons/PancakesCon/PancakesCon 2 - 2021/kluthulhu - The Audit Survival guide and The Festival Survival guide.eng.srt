1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,040
the audit survival guide

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,560
followed by the festival survival guide

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,240
so clue we'll let you start your audio

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,480
and

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,400
kick things off yep all right

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,560
let's share some things tell me when i'm

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,038
good to go

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,600
let's make sure we're good all right

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,199
we're looking good on the stream

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,840
so you're all set wonderful hello

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,480
everybody

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,279
um so

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,599
question is we're at an infosight

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,440
conference why the hell am i talking

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,640
about audits right

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,640
and um unless you're

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,640
involved in one right audits are this

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,920
like abstract concept

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,079
with some many preconceived notions

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,079
right so

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,480
all i'm gonna try to do today is kind of

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,480
demystify the topic a little bit like

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,800
take away some of the apprehension give

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,079
some basic advice

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,640
right because there are some scenarios

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,320
especially when we're like at the

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,920
beginning of our career when we're gonna

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,680
stumble into this without being prepared

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,160
like

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,280
let's say you're the only i.t guy at

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
this fancy biotech startup and now the

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,439
fda is coming paying you a visit

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,400
cool right or your line manager is on

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,040
vacation

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,720
and now you are basically the only guy

36
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,159
who knows about identity and access

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,360
management

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,439
right or you are tasked with managing

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,439
the infrastructure and services

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,880
during an audit right all of those are

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,240
reasons where you will end up

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,400
involved in this without any formal

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,880
training or prep

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,600
so who am i my name is christouro or

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,158
just clue

46
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,159
i started my career in rec engineering

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,560
and testing mostly for like regulated

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,280
industries

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,240
um was usually the only one talking

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,920
about security and privacy in those

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,119
projects

52
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,119
and i kind of stumbled into information

53
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,560
management from them

54
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,040
and as part of that then quality

55
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
governance the whole shebang

56
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,840
um and audit prep and audit management

57
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,600
was more of like a side effect

58
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,559
right i was

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,240
first i started designing and testing

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,520
systems that would be under audit

61
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,239
scrutiny

62
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,000
then managing the systems that had the

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,920
data that auditors wanted to see

64
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,680
right so um just a short disclaimer

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,280
anything i say today of course is my

66
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,879
personal view and not any employer i'm

67
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,480
not gonna name my employer but i'm not

68
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,440
so hard to also

69
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,280
so right and any anecdotes that might

70
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,000
happen today

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,720
will not be from my current employer

72
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,319
makes sense

73
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,920
um all right

74
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,080
expectation versus reality let's start

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,319
by dispelling the misconceptions

76
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,680
um the vast majority of audits are

77
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,640
routine

78
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,440
and cooperative what do i mean by that

79
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,560
they're required by

80
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,280
some sort of quality framework or

81
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
regulators depending on your industry

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,519
require them and the same goes for your

83
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,879
customers right depending on what

84
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,319
customers you have

85
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,720
they're going to ask you we want to come

86
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,680
audit you

87
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,560
right and in most cases they are

88
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,440
announced

89
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,239
weeks or even months ahead of time right

90
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,640
audited party has limited input on times

91
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,680
and dates

92
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,239
auditing parties sends a plan a schedule

93
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,879
what they want to look at and so on

94
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,280
right so this is not like you're not

95
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,080
getting ambushed by it

96
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,879
now with that said sometimes audits are

97
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,799
indeed unannounced

98
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,280
but unannounced does not mean that

99
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,720
they're unexpected

100
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,400
right um

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
some of them are just still routine

102
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,519
they're part of your same quality

103
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,599
framework that has the announced ones

104
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,000
however um unexpected or adversarial

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,799
audits

106
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,280
do happen right usually reserved for

107
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,519
cases where misbehavior is suspected

108
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,040
like dawn raids or the absence of an

109
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,319
uh right so if you're ever pulled into

110
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:54,959
an audit

111
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,879
and no one's giving you a different

112
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,480
explanation as to why you're here

113
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,840
right so i'm like hey joe um

114
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,280
we need you to talk about xyz then maybe

115
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,959
get

116
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,080
uh defensive but apart from that

117
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,200
chill right um

118
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,360
now the rest of the talk will only focus

119
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,358
on everything that i

120
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,720
said is routine because that is what

121
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,800
99.9 percent of the time is going to be

122
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,919
the stuff you will be

123
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,360
facing or involved as i t

124
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,800
also it's what i know most right

125
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,919
all right a lot of the planning and

126
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,080
preparing goes into audit readiness

127
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,680
which but that's a subject for another

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,160
talk but

129
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,360
a lot of effort goes into setting up and

130
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
maintaining a controlled environment

131
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,280
right that's part of the mystique if

132
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,800
you've been around it's like

133
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,560
oh don't go over there into that meeting

134
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,120
room right there's an audit in progress

135
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,360
um so just to understand with the

136
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,199
logistics usually you will have like an

137
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:57,919
audit room

138
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,600
which can also be called like a front

139
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,120
office inspection room

140
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,199
interview room whatever that's usually

141
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,400
where the auditors

142
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,639
uh your colleagues who are managing them

143
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,560
and any sort of scribes are sitting

144
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,479
right it's like an interview room um

145
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,000
then you have usually a second room

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,080
which is ready room so you have some

147
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,280
coordinators against scribes ops support

148
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,919
basically they're running more or less

149
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,880
incident response for this right

150
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,919
and sometimes they're going to run

151
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,160
around doing visits of facilities

152
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,039
server rooms and so on right and the

153
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,639
scribes will always be relaying

154
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,880
information between them

155
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,960
so again everything is about a

156
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
controlled environment

157
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,800
so let's say you're getting this dreaded

158
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,759
call

159
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,800
hi this is joe from quality the auditor

160
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,160
has a question on

161
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,960
topic x and um you're listed as someone

162
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,759
who can provide some answers

163
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,800
um the first thing is breathe

164
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,280
right this isn't like a building on fire

165
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,560
situation

166
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,080
you are not expected to rush the

167
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,240
interview room in the next five minutes

168
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,880
right usually your back office will tell

169
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,919
you

170
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,360
at what time they're expecting you but

171
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,960
it's not like

172
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,560
run down right before you do anything

173
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,199
else

174
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,000
clarify with them what the scope of the

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
audit is on what topics you will be

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,800
questioned right if you're expected to

177
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,520
provide any additional material

178
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,800
right and once you know that you can

179
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,919
start preparing for it

180
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,639
right prepare yourself anything you need

181
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,520
or have been asked to provide

182
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,120
get yourself a notepad or something like

183
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,680
that and then clear your schedule

184
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,080
um because nothing's worse than going in

185
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,800
and then

186
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,919
being asked to run out again because

187
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,240
basically

188
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,520
even if you are working in like

189
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,880
incidence response or something like

190
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,919
that

191
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,240
this interview is now your incident

192
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,199
right there's

193
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,639
very little that can be more important

194
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,840
than that

195
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,240
um and then just go

196
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,120
right maybe detour to the restroom if

197
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,840
you feel so

198
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,479
like that but you know just go down

199
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,360
calmly

200
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,360
nothing to be scared of um

201
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,840
once you're there first and foremost i

202
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,039
think that's something that

203
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,560
really needs to be hammered into

204
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,400
everyone's head this

205
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,880
isn't about you right this is not a

206
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
performance review

207
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,960
this is the company being audited not

208
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,080
you personally

209
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,400
right you are providing some insight

210
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,120
into some

211
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,440
specific area of work that you know

212
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,400
about

213
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,840
right but take it seriously right

214
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
basic stuff take your phone off if your

215
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,520
company stupid thing like

216
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,440
if your company has a badge policy then

217
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,879
don't leave your badge upstairs or have

218
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,520
it hidden

219
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,719
right it's the small stuff like that um

220
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,800
this whole thing is going to be about

221
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,680
the role

222
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,280
you happen to fill at that company right

223
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,520
so describe explain your role in the job

224
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,440
that you do be able to describe and

225
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,560
identify any

226
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,639
like procedures and other written stuff

227
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,639
that governs your work

228
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,240
describe the interfaces with your

229
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,720
customers your colleagues and so on

230
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,560
right basically you should be able to

231
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,840
tell them what what the cog

232
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,360
in the company machinery you are right

233
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,360
and of course provide documentation of

234
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,639
your actions etc

235
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,120
right demonstrate your work maybe

236
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,640
possibly

237
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,958
um now there's a flip side to this

238
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,000
this isn't about you right an

239
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,760
audit is not the place to flaunt your

240
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,120
skills

241
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,560
right so don't overstep

242
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,440
speak only for yourself clarify the

243
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,040
limit of your responsibilities if you're

244
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,320
being asked about stuff you're not

245
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,000
responsible for

246
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
don't step around the problem just tell

247
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,120
them nah

248
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,959
i don't know this is not really what i

249
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,320
do every day

250
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,839
and that's fine right

251
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,120
especially don't talk about someone

252
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,240
else's job

253
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,600
don't critique someone else's job again

254
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,680
right do not blame or complain about

255
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
anything or anyone

256
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,000
other than what you do right audit is a

257
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,680
snapshot anyway

258
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,120
and also i know it's going to sound

259
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,040
stupid but do not start

260
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,720
back talking or critiquing the auditors

261
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,360
because you don't want to alienate them

262
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,640
because even if you

263
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,440
manage your interview well you can't be

264
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,959
sure that every colleague after that is

265
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,240
going to handle it well so

266
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,360
you know don't be an [ __ ]

267
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,240
um or in general don't antagonize right

268
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,920
and most importantly and i think that's

269
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
the last part and it goes back to

270
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,240
this is not about flaunting your skills

271
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,680
um

272
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,600
don't be a smart ass right no one

273
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,640
no right so

274
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,480
in short this is basically a friendly

275
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
interview right don't turn it into a

276
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,000
performance of yourself or an

277
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,760
interrogation

278
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,000
sounds easy so let's go

279
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,839
uh most of the interview will basically

280
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,399
be a straightforward series of questions

281
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,079
right so

282
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,560
before you do anything else like be sure

283
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,240
you understand what the question is

284
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,519
before answering right

285
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,120
if you do not understand the question

286
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,360
ask for clarification

287
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,800
if the question is not in your area of

288
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,360
expertise right

289
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,480
take your time

290
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,399
what information needs to be part of

291
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,320
your answer

292
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
how do i structure my answer to get my

293
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
point across and

294
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,600
only then give your answer

295
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,800
right by the way any resemblance to the

296
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,760
input process

297
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,640
output idea is purely coincidental

298
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,160
um all right

299
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,240
understanding a few details that might

300
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,760
be interesting

301
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,680
um this is not a frequent problem in the

302
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
u.s but

303
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,200
if you and the auditor don't speak the

304
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,079
same language at least not fluently

305
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,000
that is not your problem right

306
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,839
translators are a thing

307
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,360
if the auditors are in a foreign country

308
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,640
that's they're supposed to bring

309
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,600
translators

310
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
if you work in a country where which is

311
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,279
not your native language

312
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,959
then that is on the back office to get a

313
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,200
translator in so that they can translate

314
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,480
right don't stifle your possibility or

315
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,399
ability to explain stuff just because

316
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,760
you're trying to do it in a language you

317
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,959
are not fluent with

318
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,279
right

319
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,360
focus on the question itself right don't

320
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,120
start like formulating your answer until

321
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
you've heard the question in full

322
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,600
because you're not going to pay

323
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,560
attention to what is being asked and

324
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,680
don't sign up your colleague like uh

325
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,120
like you're looking for approval it's

326
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,800
like you're

327
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
at that point you're the subject matter

328
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,720
expert in the room right

329
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,959
and if there's any like edge case where

330
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,040
you shouldn't be answering or something

331
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,440
that's on your senior colleagues who are

332
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,639
managing the audit

333
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,120
to stop you basically right

334
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,079
and again if you have any doubt ask for

335
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,240
clarifications

336
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,160
turn hypothetical questions if you're

337
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
being asked a hypothetical question

338
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,760
ask them to rephrase that as a concrete

339
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,920
one right don't go with like

340
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,839
uh don't answer a question like oh what

341
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,360
would you do if

342
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,680
no this is about what do you do when

343
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,720
right um

344
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,560
and a good way to do that by the way is

345
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,320
to rephrase a question

346
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,560
right so huh okay so if i understand you

347
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,920
correctly what you mean

348
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,079
is and so on right

349
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,920
um and most importantly know your limits

350
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,560
if this is

351
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,240
outside of your scope beyond your

352
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,440
understanding say so

353
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,959
um thinking so the second part of our

354
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,160
little process model

355
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,240
um this is gonna sound super obvious i

356
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,360
know but um

357
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,839
think about what you want to say and how

358
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,880
you want to say it

359
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,519
don't rush to start talking right this

360
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,399
isn't an exam there's no like time limit

361
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,240
right stay factual and on topic right

362
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,160
no assumptions like oh i think this is

363
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,680
that or i assume or i

364
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,200
guess no or my favorite one is like

365
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,079
well to be honest because at that moment

366
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,200
i'm gonna ask you well

367
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,079
are you not honest the rest of the time

368
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,200
right

369
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,399
um don't blame someone else we had it

370
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,519
already but

371
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,600
things like oh no that's not my problem

372
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,920
or now that's too expensive or

373
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,279
is this an edge case no

374
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,920
right and most importantly don't deflect

375
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,680
right something like ah we always used

376
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,800
to do it this way or

377
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,480
i don't care or stuff like that it's

378
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,560
like no

379
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,839
right and then to the answer itself

380
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,560
well just like the thought process

381
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,920
don't rush it right take your time

382
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,199
talk slowly talk clearly

383
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,440
take a breather effort sentences right

384
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,120
if you're asked for or need

385
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,519
documentation

386
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,680
or let's say they want the you they ask

387
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,519
you to bring like a 20-page sop and they

388
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,880
want to know specifically what's in

389
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,040
there or a specific question on it

390
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,839
point them to the exact page of it right

391
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,199
um and if you're asked to demonstrate

392
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:31,680
something

393
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,880
let's say you're a system owner or

394
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,120
something stick to like some common use

395
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
case not some weird edge case

396
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,480
where you can again demonstrate how cool

397
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,720
you are um

398
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,399
and then the most important part

399
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,199
stop when you're done again sounds

400
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:47,920
stupid

401
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,240
but it's not your job to keep the

402
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,760
conversation going right

403
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,800
silence is okay

404
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,639
especially when you have like people

405
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,519
around you all taking notes

406
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,680
and if you want to be really fancy you

407
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,880
can always end it with your

408
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,680
head did that answer your question do

409
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,440
you have any follow-up

410
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,680
right

411
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,440
and that's already about it again this

412
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,160
is all about

413
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,519
like demystifying this this concept

414
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,600
which is really not as scary as some

415
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,440
people make it sound

416
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,760
um i have some closing general thoughts

417
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,920
that i think should be some takeaways

418
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,680
first of all an audit is not about

419
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,279
perfection it is about

420
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,720
control right stable

421
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,759
and mature procedures are king right

422
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,440
some deviations or errors will

423
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,600
inevitably happen in any company

424
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,639
right it is how you handle them that is

425
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,120
important

426
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,160
um i said it before the auditor is not

427
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,120
your enemy

428
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,240
but it's still their job to find stuff

429
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,959
right they will not prevent you from

430
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,639
running off a cliff

431
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,880
that's why they use take conversation

432
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,639
techniques like staying silent for like

433
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,839
half a minute

434
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,800
or

435
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,399
baiting you into answering stuff that is

436
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,320
not in your scope

437
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,360
right again they're not being mean it's

438
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
their job

439
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,639
and um last thing is if if

440
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,399
if you're interested in anything in that

441
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,399
broad area there are a few things that

442
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,399
that transfer that are not specific to

443
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,880
this area of work

444
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,920
like conversation techniques such as

445
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,759
active listening

446
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,920
you can use that anywhere whether you're

447
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,279
a project manager whether you're

448
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,959
developing something and are talking to

449
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,680
your customers

450
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,399
all of this is relevant in most areas of

451
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,519
our work

452
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,440
right and if you ever want to get into

453
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,680
any sort of ops or incident response

454
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,519
um running the prep room or the back

455
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,519
office depending on how big the whole

456
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,040
thing is

457
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,959
is pretty much the same it's basically

458
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,319
incident response and operations

459
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,720
um and with that do we have any

460
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,600
questions on this part

461
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,760
i don't see any and slack so

462
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,160
unless

463
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,119
anyone type something right now we're

464
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,119
gonna move on to the

465
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,919
less formal part festivals

466
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,280
all right

467
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,039
well just like for most of us covet

468
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,360
kinda ruined my summer last year right

469
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,240
i'm not the only one

470
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,440
i'm getting a question

471
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,760
um okay kidding aside can you touch on

472
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,520
working with internal versus external

473
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,880
ones

474
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,150
um

475
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,319
[Music]

476
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,160
i would say you can there are two things

477
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,200
that i've seen often one is

478
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
you need to explain more to external

479
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,039
auditors because even basic things like

480
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,799
your id infrastructure or like logon

481
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,160
procedures or something like that

482
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,960
an internal auditor mostly knows that an

483
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,360
external might need to get it explained

484
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,120
right that's one part um

485
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,240
and the second part is of course uh an

486
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,360
internal will have usually even more

487
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,120
info on you beforehand at least that's

488
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,280
the experience i've had

489
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,679
uh but apart from that

490
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,280
that's more on the back of us basically

491
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,799
telling me hey this is an external audit

492
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,880
or this is one of our customers

493
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,679
and these are maybe some touchy subjects

494
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,160
right

495
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,760
that again is part of this like

496
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,440
operation

497
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,640
um and uh

498
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,120
an incidence response part can you show

499
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,240
example of people not following

500
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,520
recommendations

501
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,559
um yeah

502
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,120
uh i have to pick something that is some

503
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
time ago

504
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,160
uh oh yeah there's a good one um so when

505
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,919
auditors are here for an extended amount

506
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,760
of time

507
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,960
uh they'll usually usually eat on site

508
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,640
and we've had one that's like a decade

509
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,880
ago where basically

510
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
some colleagues who ran the audit office

511
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,799
basically let them run loose

512
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,440
on campus for the hour of lunch without

513
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,360
accompanying them

514
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,600
and basically they spent their hour in

515
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,559
the canteen

516
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,400
and listening to the chatter from

517
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,880
colleagues

518
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,720
and they picked up some stuff that was

519
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,480
interesting and it ruined our

520
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,720
whole afternoon so that's one thing

521
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,000
i know i didn't touch on it because

522
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,360
that's more on the side of like the

523
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,000
audit manager up top but

524
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,360
it should come without saying if you

525
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,520
have externals coming into your site

526
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,760
especially if they're digging maybe

527
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,840
don't let them just run free

528
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,919
right again we're supposed to have a

529
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,440
controlled environment

530
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,480
so that includes breaks right

531
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,159
all right festivals again um

532
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,840
basically this is my weird and messed up

533
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,600
way of reminiscing about

534
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,240
last summer or the summers before and

535
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,320
maybe give a few pointers to those of

536
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,840
you hopefully get to enjoy some live

537
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,799
events soon

538
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,799
right so most of this will be based on

539
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,280
my experience at larger festivals like

540
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,480
something like this right but most of it

541
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,919
will also apply to any sort of similar

542
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,039
outdoorsy event right

543
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,440
um so i've been a volunteer medic for

544
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,880
like 20 years now i

545
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,760
i've loved live music for even longer um

546
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,080
and

547
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,760
most of what i say just like the first

548
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,320
part will sound stupidly obvious

549
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,840
right but i can tell you just from

550
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,559
patient

551
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,120
um i think we have a quest in the wrong

552
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,080
channel here but

553
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,440
all right um most of what i say will

554
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,120
sound super basic and obvious just based

555
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,080
on patient

556
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
conversations i've had and the injury

557
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,440
patterns i've seen

558
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,200
i assure you it is not uh

559
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,919
just a short disclaimer because uh we

560
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,520
are a pg-13 conference

561
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,000
this talk will have zero explicit

562
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,280
medical imagery

563
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,520
i will not go into any sort of medical

564
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,559
gruesome depressing or whatever detail

565
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,760
so you're good

566
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,799
so some prep work i'm going to cheat a

567
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,240
little bit because i didn't

568
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,520
go into any sort of infosec topic

569
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,120
actually in the first part so i'm going

570
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,840
to touch on it a little bit now

571
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,200
do some oceans kinda

572
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,159
what i mean is um most larger events

573
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,840
have a treasure trove of information

574
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,559
available

575
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,799
to help you prepare and have a better

576
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,159
time as a result right

577
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,240
just some general information like area

578
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,000
maps timetables

579
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,440
opening hours right also what you can

580
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,960
buy on site

581
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,280
versus what you need to bring or buy

582
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,240
along the way right

583
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
most festivals are quite isolated out of

584
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,440
necessity for the space they need

585
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,000
right some will have a like a small shop

586
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,640
on site

587
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,679
some don't um

588
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,480
also what are you allowed to bring onto

589
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,520
the campgrounds

590
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,280
or the infield right just for

591
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,880
explanation campground is where you camp

592
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,320
infield is the area

593
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,440
next to the stages usually separated by

594
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,080
an extra layer of security

595
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,000
and for the campground especially can

596
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,120
you take your

597
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,159
car onto the campgrounds to your tent or

598
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,840
not

599
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,120
right some festivals have just like yeah

600
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,559
plop everything down in the corner and

601
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,840
you're good some have specific parking

602
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,080
areas

603
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,640
and that makes a difference

604
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,760
a little side note

605
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,280
don't assume that you will have a stable

606
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,440
cell or wi-fi on site

607
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,320
it's getting better but still again we

608
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,640
are

609
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,480
a bit isolated you are having tens of

610
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,400
thousands of people

611
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,159
so try to have any info you need at

612
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,039
least locally

613
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,400
um so now you have all the info you need

614
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,320
time to get packing

615
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,799
what and how much you take will widely

616
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:11,679
differ

617
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,440
depending on the kind of event and how

618
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
you travel

619
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,919
but um just a few things to consider

620
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,440
when putting together your gear

621
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,000
right what do you want to buy on site

622
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and instead of bringing it from home

623
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,440
right especially everything that's food

624
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,200
and drink related

625
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,640
will also depend if you want to make

626
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,320
your own food or buy on concession

627
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,760
stands

628
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,039
um you might to have to haul all that

629
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:37,919
gear

630
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,000
for half a mile over uneven terrain

631
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,440
especially in the cases i had before

632
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,120
with where the car is not where the tent

633
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,360
is

634
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,679
uh you are possibly going to need like

635
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,000
some smallish bag for the stuff you want

636
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,159
on you during the day right like

637
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,320
reasonably pickpocket safe

638
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,158
and mosh pit ready if that's your jam

639
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,760
and that bag and its content need to

640
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,520
pass in-field security because not

641
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,799
everything that you're allowed to have

642
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,760
in your tent

643
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,640
let's say a long cooking knife is

644
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,679
allowed

645
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,080
in field right includes by the way most

646
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
drink containers so you can have like

647
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,360
your glass bottles and campsites

648
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,880
but not in field

649
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,600
so and uh another side note once you

650
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,200
have found your little cozy spot lock

651
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,360
your gear or there

652
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,400
set everything up right away instead of

653
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,000
at 2 am in the dark when you're drunk

654
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,080
so now that we're all set up let's go to

655
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,200
what we're actually going to see on the

656
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,799
medical side a little bit

657
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,320
i'm going to structure this a little bit

658
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,400
like using a mnemonic that is very

659
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,159
common in accessing patients which is

660
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,320
called abcde

661
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,559
uh starting with ab which stands for

662
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,000
airways and breathing

663
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,880
so we don't see too many common

664
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
diagnoses in that area

665
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,679
but one thing i'd recommend especially

666
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,840
now that we've gotten used to it

667
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,320
bring some face masks because if it's

668
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,039
dry it's going to get dusty

669
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,679
and even people without asthma regularly

670
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,880
come in with respiratory problems

671
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,120
and also unfortunately we get we're

672
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,400
seeing more and more pyros

673
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,520
in the crowd here and there sometimes

674
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,279
even part of the show so brought in by

675
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,000
the artists

676
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,080
but that's a different story um

677
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,240
small tangent again since i touched on

678
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,760
asthmatics

679
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,880
if you are an asthmatic diabetic need

680
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,679
any other

681
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,240
daily daily medication for any other

682
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,679
reason

683
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,919
check if you can store it with the

684
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,279
medical team

685
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,880
especially with like larger events

686
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,480
there's a good chance they are going to

687
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,679
offer

688
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,120
um they're going to offer like

689
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,360
to to store your refrigerated medication

690
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,840
at least

691
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,240
all right moving on to circulation

692
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,039
so that mostly covers like blood loss

693
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,960
and other fluid problems

694
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,679
so blood loss luckily is very rarely an

695
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,799
issue

696
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,279
dehydration on the other hand is very

697
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,640
common

698
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,919
i mean you're out in the sun for eight

699
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,080
plus hours you're jumping and dancing

700
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,679
you're going to need water by the

701
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,679
gallons right

702
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,120
and no beer doesn't count

703
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,960
even if it's light american beer

704
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,080
so because you know i'm not your mom

705
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,679
but something tells me you'd rather be

706
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,679
in front of a stage than snoring in the

707
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,880
drunk tank

708
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,440
so pace yourselves this is a marathon

709
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,080
not a sprint

710
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,400
next up disability and dysfunction

711
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,520
it's not a very descriptive term but the

712
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,640
mnemonic wanted the d

713
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,919
so we're going with that um

714
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,000
it is a bit of a catch-all for anything

715
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,520
affecting or impairing your

716
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,320
consciousness

717
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,240
right including alcohol but we already

718
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,440
covered that

719
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,279
um what we haven't covered yet are all

720
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,880
the other narcotics you might be

721
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,320
inclined to

722
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,520
right again i'm not your mom a few

723
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,559
important things

724
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,880
medics won't judge you for being high as

725
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,240
balls

726
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,760
they won't drag you out to securely

727
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,679
unless you attack them

728
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,240
but we need to know right

729
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,600
we need to know what you've taken

730
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,279
because it influences our treatment on

731
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,559
you

732
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,799
and again other side note

733
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,559
if you want to if you want to take

734
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,640
something maybe don't buy your gear on

735
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,000
site from a stranger

736
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,720
right know yourself what you are

737
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,960
consuming

738
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,080
and also maybe don't try new stuff for

739
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,880
the first time

740
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,480
right the whole situation is going to be

741
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
overwhelming as it is

742
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,000
so maybe don't add another layer to it

743
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
um another very common issue we

744
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,200
see is um sun stroke i touched on it

745
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,760
before

746
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,840
bears repeating you're going to be in

747
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,440
the scotching sun for hours

748
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,320
you're basically trying your brain right

749
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,960
so do yourself a favor

750
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,080
and wear some kind of hat right

751
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,840
get some shade if you feel dizzy or

752
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,600
start getting a headache

753
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,520
it doesn't have to be this big but you

754
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,840
know whatever floats about

755
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,320
i thought i've got a pink but that's

756
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,120
fine okay

757
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,000
next finally we come to e

758
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,960
for exposure this is a bit of an

759
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,080
umbrella for anything

760
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,799
else exterior that affects the patient

761
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,120
like

762
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,000
including injuries

763
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,760
since we already talked about sun

764
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,840
strokes let's expand this to sunburns in

765
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,159
general

766
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,039
right now turning red like mr krabs is

767
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,399
not something that

768
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,240
regularly needs medical attention but

769
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,760
again you're out there for hours and

770
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,240
i've seen blisters the size of my hand

771
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,559
and that can have some serious

772
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,840
physiological implications

773
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,159
some other things protection-wise people

774
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,760
forget on a frequent basis

775
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,399
sunglasses just as a little aside

776
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,279
stages will when possible be facing

777
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,000
north if it's

778
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,080
geographically and logistically possible

779
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,200
because

780
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
we don't want to fry this the singers on

781
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,480
stage

782
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
but that also means the audience will

783
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,000
usually be looking in the general

784
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,960
direction of the sun

785
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,200
earplugs should be obvious

786
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,279
right but still you most vessels even

787
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,320
give you free

788
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,679
earplugs nowadays use them

789
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,039
and condoms yes

790
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,159
you'd be surprised how many

791
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,000
prescriptions for plan b change hands

792
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,200
during a festival weekend

793
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,240
you might not plan for a hookup but be

794
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,840
prepared for one

795
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,480
please um

796
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,080
there's a running joke at some festivals

797
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,840
when we say that usually there are more

798
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,240
people

799
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,240
coming back from festivals that that

800
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,039
then went to

801
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,840
all right um until now

802
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,600
we've mostly been talking about warm

803
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,960
weather right on the flip side

804
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,120
wet weather can be devastating if you're

805
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,320
not prepared

806
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,159
right this applies to both your clothing

807
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,080
during the day as well as your tent

808
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,600
during the night

809
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,640
so don't forget your raincoat and maybe

810
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
don't rely on those cheap like 20

811
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,000
throw tents and a little blanket to keep

812
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,840
you warm at night

813
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
right

814
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,360
all right i'm gonna

815
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,120
do one more thing on exposure because

816
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,640
i already mentioned injuries and if

817
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,559
there's only one thing i want you to

818
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,760
take away from this

819
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,840
one single thing wear some decent shoes

820
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,519
i can tell you that bad footwear

821
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,840
accounts directly or indirectly for

822
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,559
maybe half of all injuries we see right

823
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,159
whether you're spraining an ankle

824
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,320
walking or dancing on an even terrain

825
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,360
whether you're tripping

826
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,679
slipping or anything else and injuring

827
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,360
other parts of your body

828
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,919
uh whether you are standing on some hot

829
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,840
surfaces or sharp objects

830
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,440
um or just other people stepping on your

831
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,440
toes right

832
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,519
i'm not saying you need to walk around

833
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,799
in work boots

834
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,519
although i personally do even off duty

835
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,960
but that's because i have them with me

836
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,080
anyway

837
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,240
um i'm saying keep in mind that you will

838
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,640
be walking several miles a day over

839
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,760
multiple days

840
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,480
and partying

841
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,360
remember what i said about all the gear

842
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,799
you had to haul

843
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,600
to your campground at the beginning

844
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,000
imagine

845
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,559
having to haul all of it back after

846
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,480
three days of partying with a hobbled

847
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,760
foot

848
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,240
not fun

849
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,000
all right um i'm gonna finish with some

850
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,519
miscellaneous things i didn't fit

851
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,279
everywhere else but i just want to

852
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,550
at least mention um

853
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,080
[Music]

854
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,559
obviously everything is more fun and

855
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,039
safer with friends right

856
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,000
so if you can get a little group of

857
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,600
people together

858
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,840
also allows you to pool your tents and

859
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,959
your food etc

860
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,000
um plan on not having access to a power

861
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,919
outlet and plan your phone usage

862
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,039
accordingly right

863
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,919
power banks are your friend some

864
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,120
festivals are starting to

865
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,080
offer like charging stations some even

866
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,919
for free

867
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,600
and small tip from me would be leave

868
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,200
your power bank to chan

869
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,279
to charge not your phone

870
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,960
again and i said it before again and

871
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,880
again a festival is a marathon not a

872
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,600
sprint

873
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
it is designed to have something for

874
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,360
everybody

875
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,679
and if you are remotely curious or

876
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,679
open-minded you will want to do more and

877
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,080
see

878
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,880
more than there are hours in a day right

879
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,640
just at some point just tell yourself

880
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,000
okay

881
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,080
chill um

882
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,639
and um

883
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,200
yeah please clean up after the event

884
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,279
yeah that's uh actually a thing

885
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,679
yeah um one thing that is being offered

886
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,200
more and more also tattoos piercing and

887
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,080
other body mods

888
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,000
just don't right just a straight up

889
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,720
don't do that at a festival this is not

890
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,399
a knock on all the vendors and tattoo

891
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:54,960
shops who

892
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,200
offer it right but no amount of

893
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,120
sanitizing on their part

894
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,799
can save you if you are rolling in the

895
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,799
dirt afterwards

896
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,840
an infected tattoo is ugh

897
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,359
all right um one last thing for all the

898
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,280
budding social engineers in the audience

899
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,960
who might want to social engineer their

900
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,399
way backstage and

901
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,480
since the internet tells me that

902
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,879
listicles are all the rage

903
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,239
here are top five things to do backstage

904
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,639
number five get run over by a truck full

905
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,200
of equipment

906
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
number four snap a blurry pick of an

907
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,879
artist in the 10 seconds between they

908
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,520
leave stage

909
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,639
and disappear into a van number three

910
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,079
get run over by an atv number two

911
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,280
hide from security in the ditch

912
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,839
and number one get run over by forklifts

913
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,800
in case the sarcasm isn't obvious just

914
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,560
stay out of areas you don't belong in

915
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,639
right hundreds and thousands of people

916
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,920
are working in a high pressure

917
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,040
environment

918
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,880
and don't need some idiot standing in

919
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,960
their way

920
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,160
okay that's just my personal pet peeve

921
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,800
but

922
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,300
okay and um

923
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,400
[Music]

924
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,880
thank you and in general just stay safe

925
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,960
and uh don't worry about us getting

926
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,680
bored because we'd rather just enjoy the

927
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,640
scenery with you

928
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,598
than patch you up

929
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,640
and that's it from me do we have any

930
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,040
open

931
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,680
questions in the chat uh i've seen i've

932
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,119
seen some comments i didn't touch on

933
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:33,440
like

934
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,560
cleaning up after yourself obvious um

935
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,480
[Music]

936
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,599
yeah it looks like we're not seeing any

937
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,680
real open questions just kind of

938
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,359
some commenting research some points are

939
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,680
really good they're

940
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,040
not really primarily in the medical

941
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,880
thing or things i see all the time so i

942
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,680
didn't touch on them

943
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,880
but yeah all right well overall

944
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
that was a great talk on both of your

945
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,640
points hoping that one day we can see

946
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,320
each other at a festival and we can be

947
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,200
around people again

948
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
i wouldn't mind so preferably not

949
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,359
because i'm triaging you

950
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,280
yeah it looks like we're slowly starting

951
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,119
to get things a little back to normal

952
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,839
yeah one of my i just had a concert

953
