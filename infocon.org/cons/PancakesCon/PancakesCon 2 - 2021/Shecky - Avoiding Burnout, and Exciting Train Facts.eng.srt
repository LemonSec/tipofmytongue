8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,880
everybody

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,840
today i'd like to talk to you guys a

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,119
little bit about something called

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,080
burnout

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,680
it's not going to be a highly technical

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,920
talk it's a subject that goes

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,760
very deep but is very important

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,760
especially for those of you just

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,600
starting your careers here as you get

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,559
older

18
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,399
you start to understand it a little bit

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,000
more but

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,120
it's not something that is you hear

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,719
people talk about it but you think

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,920
that can't happen to me and it can

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,000
happen to just about anybody

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,520
and it's one of the reasons why we have

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,120
some of the issues that we have in the

26
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,920
industry

27
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,760

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,840
why i love trains and yes we will get

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,120

00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,839
in a little bit

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,280

i've got my blog site um i help organize

40

model railroad aficionado

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,360
i'm not the best in the world i'm not

45
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,240
the worst in the world

46
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,040
so let's get into this topic itself

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,000
burnout

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,759
what is burnout the easiest way to

49
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,840
describe it is burnout is that feeling

50
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,880
of i don't want to do this

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,159
you wake up in the morning you don't

52
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,320
want to go to work you don't want to do

53
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
anything

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,200
it's a loss of interest it's an i don't

55
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,680
care type attitude

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,159
it can lead to depression it can lead to

57
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,600
anxiety

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,799
and it's something that you really need

59
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,840
to start looking at early on the anxiety

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,200
is usually about the first thing that

61
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,880
i've found that people wind up having

62
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,119
with

63
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,598
that anxiety of do i really want to do

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,680
this do i really want to go into work oh

65
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,239
god here we go again another job like

66
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,360
this

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,040
oh god i'm going to have to deal with my

68
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,640
boss again

69
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,360
it's not something that's fun to deal

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,160
with it all

71
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,000
and it's something that leads people out

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,760
of the infosec

73
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,360
or whatever other industry that they're

74
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,599
in but especially in the infosec because

75
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,879
we put so much pressure on ourselves

76
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,879
we think that we must have all the

77
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,080
answers

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,400
we feel that we are imposters imposter

79
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,519
syndrome fall

80
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,319
can lead to burnout just about anything

81
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,360
that makes it

82
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,239
non-fun or non-worthwhile to yourself

83
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,760
is a form of burnout in its own right

84
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,280
so overworking is probably one of the

85
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,560
biggest things that we've ever

86
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,840
heard of from burnout and you know

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,239
it's those 24-hour day shifts 12-hour

88
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,319
day shifts seven days a week

89
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,720
the large amount of time with no break

90
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,480
whatsoever

91
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
and that can be caused by poor

92
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,879
management not having enough staff on

93
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,360
hand managers don't know how to deal

94
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,920
with you

95
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,440
or with other people

96
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,720
that brings things down to a section of

97
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,280
what am what are they doing wrong who

98
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
can i talk to about it can you

99
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,200
if it's management talk to your manager

100
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,400
say hey listen

101
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,680
you're pushing me too hard you're

102
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,920
pushing me too far

103
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,519
the best managers out there aren't going

104
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,120
to want you to burn out they're going to

105
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,720
help you take that step back so that way

106
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,560
you can go ahead and do that

107
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,640
the other thing that i've noticed that

108
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,159
causes burnout is being over

109
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,200
passionate the word passion at another

110
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,599
con

111
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,080
was brought up and we had this huge

112
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,760
discussion there

113
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,319
about passion is it a good thing is it a

114
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,159
bad thing and it depends upon how you

115
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:56,720
define

116
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,200
passion passion can be as simple as

117
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,080
having a very big

118
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,200
interest in it passion can go into

119
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,959
an area of all you want to do is xyz

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,519
all you want to do is do your infosec

121
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,000
all you want to do is do your research

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,799
and you delve into everything on that

123
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:15,360
and that's

124
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,519
all that you have and you've got nothing

125
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,560
else around you

126
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,120
so what happens when you hit that wall a

127
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,880
frustration level

128
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,320
you lose all interest again

129
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,240
you get into a situation with burnout

130
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
where you need to fight it

131
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,440
the biggest mistake that people make in

132
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,199
our field

133
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,880
is paid time off we all get it

134
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,560
people do not use it and i don't mean

135
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,400
using pto to go to

136
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
a security conference i mean using paid

137
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,720
time off

138
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,639
as paid time off telling your manager

139
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,880
that yes i am taking this week off

140
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,280
and i am not answering emails i am not

141
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,440
answering my phone

142
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,720
i am out of service i need to

143
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,560
rest and recharge my batteries

144
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,720
you need to take the pto is there for

145
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,160
that reason what

146
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
period it's there to give you that

147
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,600
chance

148
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,560
to take that step back to step away from

149
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,039
the

150
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,520
grind to step away from the stress

151
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,800
now that's not to say that you won't

152
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600
have other stresses on on another side

153
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,320
or from somewhere else but to step away

154
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,919
from that work stress

155
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,520
to get that off the mind

156
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,680
you run into another issue though and

157
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,440
this happens with all of us you're on

158
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,800
vacation and you start wondering

159
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,280
especially as it gets nearer the end

160
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,400
what am i going to walk back into

161
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
and that's just something that that

162
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,160
there's not a real good answer for

163
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,280
how to stop it the answer to that is you

164
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,440
stop it by stopping it

165
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,520
the real answer is and i found this is

166
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,280
talk to the people around you talk to

167
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,039
your family talk to your friends say

168
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,560
hey listen i'm starting to think about

169
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,039
this can you distract me from it

170
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,720
find something to distract you whether

171
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,960
it be a hobby whether it be going out

172
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,400
for a bike ride

173
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
hobbies are a big way overall even

174
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,639
without paid time off to go ahead

175
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,680
and de-stress and fight that burnout

176
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,880
and i'll be showing you one of my

177
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,960
hobbies in a few minutes here which is

178
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,160
trains and you'll

179
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,319
be noticing all the trains sitting in

180
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,840
these slides here

181
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,680
uh outside of the opening slide all the

182
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,560
trains are photos that i took

183
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,919
family and friends going out and doing a

184
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:30,560
walk

185
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,039
in nature with them which i get into in

186
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,560
the last bullet point there

187
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
going ahead and just spending time

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,440
sitting down playing board games not

189
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,280
computer games necessarily but board

190
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,400
games

191
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,000
going and sitting down and having a nice

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
dinner with someone

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,560
these sorts of things uh if you're into

194
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,720
going ahead and singing karaoke can be

195
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,280
fun

196
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,759
going to an amusement park can be fun

197
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,400
something that

198
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,680
again gets you away from that stressor

199
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,039
level of work

200
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,199
that constant oh my god i have to think

201
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,639
about this oh my god i have to solve

202
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,360
this problem

203
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,560
oh my god oh my god oh my god i don't

204
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,880
want to deal with this anymore

205
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,800
so you take that step back and you let

206
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,479
your body refresh you let your mind

207
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,919
refresh

208
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,000
meditation is a very good way to go

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,840
ahead and relieve the stress

210
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,680
if you want to start trying to do that

211
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,360
and that's just as simple as sitting

212
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,720
down for 10 minutes and counting breaths

213
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,000
it meditation can be that simple just

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,479
step away from it all don't try don't

215
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,680
force your mind not to think about

216
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,000
anything

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,599
just focus on one simple thing like

218
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,039
counting breaths

219
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,199
these are all basic ways of helping to

220
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,639
fight that stress and that stress is

221
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,160
what leads you to that burnout

222
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,479
in the movie real genius they have a

223
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,919
great scene there where they're talking

224
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,599
about laszlo down in the tunnels and if

225
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,039
you haven't seen the movie real genius i

226
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,280
highly recommend it it's a fun great 80s

227
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,560
movie

228
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,639
but they're talking about the genius

229
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,319
that came before him the top dog that

230
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,599
came before

231
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,479
val kilmer and mitch and mitch's

232
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,319
characters

233
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,120
and val goes val's carrot character

234
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,440
chris

235
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,000
knight goes ahead and says yeah he broke

236
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,440
in a major way

237
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,240
he thought he he loved solving problems

238
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,520
but he thought his answers were the

239
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
answers to everything

240
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,400
so one day somebody told laszlo that

241
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,039
what he was creating was hurting people

242
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,319
and it cracked him

243
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,280
severely and that's something that we

244
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,000
all have to

245
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,319
understand there is no answer for

246
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,199
everything

247
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,000
infosec itself is really nothing more or

248
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,599
less than risk mitigation

249
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,320
overall it is something that is

250
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,000
constantly changing

251
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,240
and there is no way that you're going to

252
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,559
be an expert in every single section of

253
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,679
it

254
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,519
you might know a lot about specific

255
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,360
areas but there's always going to be

256
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
somebody smarter than you and there's

257
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,240
always going to be a new question and a

258
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,120
new way that pops up out there

259
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
and the best way of going ahead and

260
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,560
being able to

261
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,240
take care of that stuff is being fresh

262
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,279
taking that step back relaxing your mind

263
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,480
out i find honestly

264
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,800
with to help me without with answering

265
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,320
questions is stepping away from

266
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,920
all of it for a bit because all of a

267
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,440
sudden out of nowhere an answer will pop

268
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,040
into my head

269
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,240
and that's something that should work

270
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,519
for you also take a step back

271
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,000
stop thinking about it you overthink it

272
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,120
you're going to come up with the

273
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,600
with the with the wrong answer or the

274
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,240
harder way of doing it

275
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,360
and you're going to start doubting

276
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,279
yourself and then you start doubting

277
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,080
yourself

278
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,920
and then you start stressing about it

279
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,760
and then you start stressing about it

280
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,440
and then you hit that burnout level

281
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,880
again

282
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,920
and it's not fair to yourself

283
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,360
the only way you're good for other

284
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,040
people is to take care of yourself in

285
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,320
the long run

286
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,959
physically mentally emotionally

287
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,560
you can go and see a professional for

288
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,720
help and i highly recommend that there's

289
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,600
nothing wrong with that

290
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,880
but you have to understand and if you

291
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,240
can't recognize the

292
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,880
the symptoms talk to somebody else that

293
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,000
you trust

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,760
and see if they see these symptoms in

295
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,480
you the depression the anxiety the lack

296
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,440
of wanting to do

297
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,640
stuff the losing interest in things that

298
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,880
interest you not just work wise but

299
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,079
overall

300
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,519
because it all starts integrating

301
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,120
together as you go down this path

302
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,640
so as i said there's a lot more to it

303
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,839
than that

304
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,360
and we're going to get into the trains

305
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,200
in just a moment here

306
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
but i want you to understand that i'm

307
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,959
i i sound preachy it's because i've seen

308
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,560
too many people burn out i've seen too

309
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,480
many people

310
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,519
just not lose it we've seen

311
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,160
in the industry too many people get to a

312
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,720
point

313
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,959
of no control anymore and not ask for

314
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,640
that help

315
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,920
and we want you to be good we want you

316
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,720
to be safe

317
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,120
we want you to be able to help others

318
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,640
it's not something that's going to be

319
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,279
easy and it's not something that

320
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,279
looking at oneself is always the hardest

321
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,560
thing to do

322
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,760
and it's not something to be ashamed of

323
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,519
to turn around and say i'm feeling

324
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,079
burned out takes a lot of credit to

325
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,120
somebody

326
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,920
to do that saying i need to take a step

327
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,680
back

328
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,800
i'm burning out i need that time away

329
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,079
but you have to do it

330
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,279
otherwise you're just going to drive

331
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,120
yourself into a ground

332
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,839
and into an early grave and that's not

333
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,320
something

334
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,279
anybody anybody wants to see it's

335
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,240
happened to too many people

336
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,880
so let's get away from that and start

337
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,959
talking about trains trains and model

338
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,560
trains

339
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,760
and what you're seeing here in this

340
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,160
background is this is my actual layout

341
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,079
right here

342
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,040
over on the uh left hand side that's my

343
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,519
son

344
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,160
running one part of the layout you've

345
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,800
got a

346
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,959
close-up of one of my newest engines

347
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,279
that i've got uh what's called a gg1 it

348
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:03,839
was an

349
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,880
electric engine uh it was used a lot in

350
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,560
pennsylvania

351
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,360
you've got sitting next to the right

352
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,839
there

353
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,800
is a shea engine it's a type of steam

354
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,600
engine

355
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,120
but instead of horizontal drivers

356
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,240
drive rods everything is vertical on it

357
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,399
they don't go fast but they're very

358
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,839
powerful they were built for

359
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,120
logging runs and then finally is just a

360
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,200
shot out the back of an old pullman car

361
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,040
that i took

362
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,440
now i'm gonna stop sharing my screen

363
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,959
here for a moment

364
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,000
and we're going to get right into this

365
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,320
why model trains why trains at all

366
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,480
well there's two different ways of

367
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,079
looking at it i do some rail fanning

368
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,839
which is going out and actually seeing

369
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,839
trains out on the rails i'm i'm lucky

370
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,120
i've got a

371
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,519
train museum not too far away my son

372
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,519
absolutely adores training got me

373
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,560
pulled me back into all of this and then

374
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,160
there's the model railroading aspect

375
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,040
that you can do

376
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,440
right in your own home and you say well

377
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,959
i've got a small apartment well that

378
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,040
doesn't matter

379
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,880
there are a few different scales of

380
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,800
trade of model trains out there

381
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,440
this is the next to smallest i don't

382
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,800
have the smallest one which is even

383
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,600
smaller

384
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,279
the next size down from here which is

385
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,800
called z scale and i'll go over the

386
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,120
scales in a moment

387
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,200
is small enough where you can actually

388
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
run it inside of a pelican briefcase

389
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,959
you can actually make a setup along

390
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,399
those lines

391
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,639
so you have your z scale which is the

392
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,320
smallest one out there

393
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,040
you have your n scale which you'll see a

394
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,800
lot of

395
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,000
you have your ho scale

396
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,760
so you can see the difference in size n

397
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,000
scales approximately half the size of

398
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,920
h o h o is approximately half the size

399
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,800
of the infamous

400
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,439
o scale

401
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,519
o scale the best known manufacturer of o

402
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,920
scale is lionel

403
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,519
lionel back in the day also made

404
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,680
something called standard scale yes this

405
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,720
is an original

406
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,839
1920s era standard scale engine

407
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,399
yes it still runs yes it's still the

408
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,600
original motor

409
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
inside of it the wheels have been

410
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
changed once or twice

411
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,199
um i've gone ahead and done a little bit

412
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,040
of work on it myself that was

413
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,839
actually my grandfather's engine right

414
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,079
there

415
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,279
there's so much different areas of model

416
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:27,920
trains

417
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,079
in model railroading you can get down to

418
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,440
building models

419
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,760
for your layouts you can make a simple

420
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,040
layout like what i've got

421
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,160
what i've got which is just some basic

422
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,720
loops

423
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,800
you can get into intricate layouts with

424
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,000
mountains and scenery

425
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,480
but in about in the end you get into

426
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,760
something like this

427
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
this is your basic engine and yes this

428
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,000
is a 1920s one also

429
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,480
but you've got your armatures it's basic

430
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,320
electronics

431
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,399
this is a switch for allowing the train

432
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,199
to go backwards and forwards

433
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,160
and it's so pretty easy to work on

434
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,360
itself i actually have

435
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
i'm in the process of finding a new uh

436
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,600
wheel for this so that way i can

437
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,040
get this one back up and running the

438
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,480
engine itself does run though

439
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,600
so you have your engines like that you

440
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,160
can learn

441
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,000
electronics not just from the engines

442
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,760
but from wiring up

443
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,880
attracts a track site simple tracks like

444
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,440
what i

445
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,880
showed you in my picture there is i

446
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,320
have one controller per track more

447
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,560
complicated tracks you have blocks and

448
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,600
everything along those lines

449
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,959
model building is actually from the

450
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,359
1970s here my dad and i built this one

451
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,480
but you get houses you can do building

452
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,720
you can do free building

453
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,839
the nmra which i had shown up on the

454
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,199
slide and i'll show it again when i

455
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,600
re-share the screen

456
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,399
is they've got all sorts of information

457
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,360
on their website

458
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,440
the basics of wiring track wiring the

459
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,800
basics of model building

460
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,480
but they go all the way up to master

461
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,000
level stuff and master

462
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,440
certifications in model railroading and

463
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:11,920
building

464
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,720
scenery and building track layouts

465
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,440
designing

466
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,440
don't know if a lot of you realize this

467
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,279
but the original hackers the original

468
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,440
infosec people back at mi i think it was

469
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,399
mit

470
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,440
were model railroaders

471
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,040
you take a look at a model railroad

472
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,240
track when you have switches and

473
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,120
everything

474
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,800
and it's like looking at a network in

475
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,560
its own right

476
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,399
so there's a tie in there so it actually

477
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,880
does makes logical sense as to why

478
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,360
but you still get that step back as far

479
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
as i'm concerned

480
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,880
there are different styles of trains out

481
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,959
there this here

482
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,480
if you look at the difference between

483
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,360
this right here which is my

484
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,880
one of my more recent trains which i'm

485
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,399
not running right at the moment and this

486
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:56,880
here

487
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,639
you go well one's a steam engine and

488
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,160
one's a uh

489
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,759
non-steam engine or diesel i go yes

490
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,199
but there's differences that you don't

491
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,039
see on the two of these also

492
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,039
this one here is what runs off of what's

493
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,720
called dcc

494
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,720
or dc dc and dc power is

495
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,480
your basic setup you plug everything in

496
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,000
you plug your controller in and it runs

497
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,799
around

498
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,919
dcc or digital command control

499
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,160
gives you a way of going ahead and

500
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,919
running multiple trains on the same

501
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,360
track

502
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,120
timing out the engines so that way they

503
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,799
don't hit each other

504
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,640
all the way down to actual sound effects

505
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,720
such as chugging sounds

506
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,320
and whistles and bells

507
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,720
and even the sounds of engineers on the

508
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,679
trains themselves

509
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,720
now you say okay so what do we get into

510
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,919
when we're dealing with this

511
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,160
it can be as simple starter sets start

512
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,520
off around 100

513
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,559
or so if you want to go wooden trains

514
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,640
with your kids that's even less

515
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,480
expensive to start off with a basic

516
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,080
set but you can go ahead and go through

517
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,880
all different sources

518
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,559
you make it as complicated or as simple

519
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,160
as you want

520
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,000
i sit down in front of my train set and

521
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,160
i kick back and i relax

522
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,720
and i'll sit there for hours on end just

523
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
watching the trains go around

524
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,400
maybe reading a little something just

525
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
letting the the white noise of the

526
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,320
engines

527
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,720
go at it my son will come in and say i

528
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,080
want to run this train i want to run

529
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,520
that train it gives me a chance to bond

530
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,080
with him even more

531
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,559
so you're dealing with stuff that again

532
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,440
for me i find

533
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,480
nice and relaxing

534
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,679
these trains come with and i don't have

535
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,280
a way of pulling this one apart let me

536
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,120
go grab

537
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,840
this one here

538
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,159
this right here

539
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,880
is actually an engine from when i was a

540
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,200
kid this was actually one of my two

541
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,840
favorites when i was a kid

542
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,720
and i'll show you what i'm talking about

543
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,679
squares

544
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,200
ease of working on them because top tops

545
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,559
right off

546
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,760
and then you get into just got a couple

547
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,600
basic wires going to a motor right in

548
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,840
the center

549
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,000
and really upkeep on this is cleaning

550
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,520
the wheels

551
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,120
putting a drop of oil in the bearings

552
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,320
every so often and lubricating the

553
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,960
rods and that's it that's your most

554
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,520
basic

555
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,918
dc engine

556
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,960
and different dc engines will run a

557
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,679
different

558
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,039
we'll run different ways you'll have

559
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,360
ones that can go ahead and

560
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,120
like this one here from back in the day

561
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,799
was made for kids

562
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,799
more so because it was made to be able

563
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,559
to run fast it doesn't

564
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,600
like running slow

565
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,280
you have other engines such as this one

566
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,000
here if i bring

567
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,080
this one up to full speed on the

568
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,440
throttle

569
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,679
it's going maybe half the speed of the

570
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,440
of this one

571
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,799
on full throttle so you get a difference

572
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,240
in types

573
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,320
you can get involved with model railroad

574
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,039
clubs in your area

575
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,880
and you can get involved with other with

576
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,799
other aspects of it

577
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,400
um your hobby shops

578
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,159
along those lines your driving shops

579
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,919
will always be willing to help out it's

580
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,120
a very

581
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,280
friendly hobby overall

582
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,960
and there's always something to learn

583
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,880
with it

584
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,120
now as far as the engine's going rail

585
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,840
fanning goes

586
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,000
now as far as this goes you've seen

587
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,919
my picture here you've seen

588
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,159
this here this is a

589
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,159
each type of each one of these engines

590
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,440
are different types this is an sd40 i do

591
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
believe

592
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,320
this is the world's largest steam engine

593
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,039
the big boy which did a lot of traveling

594
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:13,919
and was

595
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,200
back up and running for the first time

596
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,120
in 60 years back in 2019

597
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,039
but you have all these different types

598
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,720
of trains out there

599
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
you can go out and do photography of

600
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,440
them you can go out to your local

601
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,720
train yards a lot of times or the tracks

602
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,520
run close by your house and if you're

603
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,880
into ham radio

604
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,159
listen to the chatter on your ham radio

605
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,880
there's a specific set of bands

606
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,480
that you can use a scanner for that you

607
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,159
can listen to the traffic

608
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,360
to the chatter between the engines and

609
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,520
between the control towers

610
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,840
very very easily there's no

611
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,520
encryption on or anything they're wide

612
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,200
open

613
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,520
it's fun to listen to but it gets you

614
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,799
outside and

615
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,320
that but there's some safety rules when

616
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,799
you're doing the outdoor train stuff

617
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,360
number one you want to stay at least 25

618
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,120
feet away from the tracks

619
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,200
that's pure safety if you don't do

620
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,919
25 feet away from the tracks well number

621
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:16,400
one half

622
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,880
most of the time you'll be trespassing

623
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,320
and number two you're really risking

624
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,159
yourself getting hit by the train

625
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,159
or getting pulled it sucked in as the

626
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,520
train goes by by

627
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
any sort of vacuum from the speed of the

628
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,760
train going by

629
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,000
so enjoy the outdoor trains safely

630
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,720
now

631
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,200
as they said i threw this all together

632
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,720
really fast so

633
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,320
it seems like i'm running a little bit

634
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,000
short on everything

635
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,320
so i'm gonna open things up to uh

636
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,080
questions shortly

637
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,720
because i'm sure a lot of you might have

638
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,760
uh some questions on it all

639
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,080
and feel free to go ahead and

640
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,679
ask away do we have any questions for

641
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,240
starters

642
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,799
alrighty so i don't see any specific

643
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,000
ones uh just

644
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,320
yet but let me uh just ask a couple of

645
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,520
my own real quick

646
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,960
uh to see if we can emphasize a few

647
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,840
different points

648
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,760
uh going back to the burnout section uh

649
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,919
what kind of experiences with burnout

650
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,480
have you had

651
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,679
i've had a few different experiences

652
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:28,559
with burnout

653
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,280
and actually none of it has really been

654
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,400
i've had one experience in the i.t world

655
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,720
with it directly

656
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,400
and that was back when i was doing

657
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,520
network engineering and consulting

658
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,640
and i was the one-man crew and i just

659
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,159
there was no way i could take a break or

660
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,080
anything i was the last man standing in

661
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,320
the department

662
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,559
and it started to affect me and it

663
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,559
really started to affect not just me but

664
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,279
my relationships with the young lady i

665
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,000
was seeing it

666
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,320
the lady that i was seeing at the time

667
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,600
my significant other and i our

668
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,840
relationship started to break down

669
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,440
i was worried about everything i was

670
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,559
constantly thinking i was going to get

671
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,960
fired for the smallest mistake

672
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,159
and it was partially because i was

673
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,600
working so hard and it was partially

674
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,240
because

675
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,200
i saw everybody else jump ship

676
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,400
um but it's it's

677
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,440
it's along those lines now as far as

678
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
actual burnout goes i used to do wedding

679
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,760
photography

680
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,919
and that got to a point where it

681
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,159
stressed me out so much that i stepped

682
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,080
away from photography completely for a

683
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,559
couple of years

684
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,799
nowadays i enjoy it as a secondary hobby

685
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,559
but it just

686
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,200
got back any influence smart trains and

687
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,640
new technologies being used we'll get to

688
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,840
that in a minute

689
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,600
um but there's

690
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,880
it burnout to me is been something that

691
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,240
since i actually

692
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,760
found a couple of real good employers

693
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,640
i've worked for

694
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,480
they forced me to go ahead they

695
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,400
initially forced me to start taking time

696
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,760
off

697
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,320
and nowadays it's like okay yeah i need

698
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,240
to step back i'm going to take a step

699
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,640
back i need to take a mental health day

700
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,000
just a day so that was there so that's

701
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,360
something you'd recommend that

702
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,279
managers would do then is is to

703
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,880
encourage their employees to

704
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,799
take time uh for avoiding burnout

705
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,000
i think that they should encourage it i

706
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,200
think they should encourage it

707
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
where they are not getting in touch with

708
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,640
that employee

709
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,000
i think managers need to be taught what

710
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,240
warning signs to look for for potential

711
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,840
burnout

712
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,520
and a lot of that's because you're not

713
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,880
going to see it yourself

714
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,159
or you're going to be afraid to talk to

715
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,000
your manager about it

716
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,679
and you got to get over that fear but if

717
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,360
the manager sees it and says i want you

718
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,200
to take a day off

719
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,880
jump at the chance because they're

720
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,840
seeing something that you're probably

721
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,600
not

722
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,000
excellent thank you for uh expanding on

723
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,400
those points for us

724
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,279
you're welcome so it looks like we have

725
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,279
a question inside of slack here any info

726
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,200
on smart trains and new technologies

727
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,679
being

728
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,120
used um i haven't

729
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,520
thought too much about smart trains um

730
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,919
there's a positive traction system that

731
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:20,880
they use right now

732
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,159
and i like the idea of deposit

733
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,480
the ptc systems out there i do believe

734
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,919
is what they're called

735
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,039
are fantastic safety systems

736
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,159
um the new technologies that are coming

737
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:34,640
out

738
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,159
on the trains again i don't

739
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,360
dig as deep into some of this as some

740
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,400
people do

741
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,919
and i'm just catching up with some of

742
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,440
the technologies

743
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,880
but they're coming out with some nice

744
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,840
stuff the model railroad side stuff the

745
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,799
technologies are just

746
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,400
unbelievable the on the rails side of

747
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,520
stuff

748
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,039
the newer engines with some of their

749
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,039
controls in it are fantastic

750
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,799
the rules for safety out there are

751
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,799
fantastic the problem is is with all

752
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,880
these new technologies

753
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,200
there are now older trains that cannot

754
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,240
run on the rails

755
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,360
because or cannot run on specific types

756
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,360
of rails because they're

757
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,039
they don't have the new technologies and

758
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,720
can't be retrofitted easily

759
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,440
the ptc system is a great example the

760
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,880
big boy which i showed you

761
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,159
to does not have a ptc system in its cab

762
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,520
so behind it runs an actual uh

763
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,240
diesel engine with ptc in it that does

764
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,360
dynamic braking

765
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,000
and makes it safe for the a-class or the

766
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,880
major

767
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,840
railroad lines smaller railroad lines

768
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,799
local lines

769
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,120
don't have that ptc requirement at this

770
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,240
point in time

771
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,919
so they could run something like the

772
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,000
shea or

773
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,720
the uh silver streak type engine that i

774
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,200
showed you before

775
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,960
all right do i have any i hope that

776
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,320
answers your question a little bit as

777
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,039
far as

778
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,880
technologies on the model railroading

779
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,320
inside

780
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,760
probably the newest technology that

781
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,279
people are starting to use is raspberry

782
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,039
pi's and the arduinos to go ahead and

783
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:07,600
run their

784
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,960
layouts do you have any thoughts on

785
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,960
unlimited pto and how that plays out

786
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,720
unlimited pto has pluses and minuses and

787
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,360
yes i have

788
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,840
a big thought on that um

789
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,520
a lot of places that i've seen that have

790
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,440
unlimited pto it's like okay yeah take

791
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,720
the time off when you need it

792
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,320
and you never think that you need it

793
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
it doesn't force people what i what i

794
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,600
prefer to see is if somebody's going to

795
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
be doing unlimited pto that

796
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,039
that a place goes ahead and does a

797
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,760
mandatory week

798
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,120
of paid time off for an individual

799
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,200
quite honestly unlimited pto is a

800
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,039
fantastic thing in theory

801
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,880
but when you're a workaholic you're just

802
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,399
going to ignore it

803
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,200
if on the other hand you force an

804
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,440
employee to say okay there's a mandatory

805
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,000
week off

806
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and we are shutting down your accounts

807
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,279
and you're not going to be able to see

808
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,559
your email or anything

809
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,240
i would much rather see if you're going

810
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
to have mandatory or

811
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,880
unlimited pto i think they need to add

812
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,600
that in

813
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,679
to the equation on it all so that way

814
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,520
people are forced to take that week

815
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,000
um yeah a lot of people that i know that

816
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,480
have

817
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,159
the unlimited pto it's unlimited pto

818
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,799
and they don't take advantage of it and

819
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,279
their

820
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,679
management don't doesn't do a lot with

821
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,200
them and they wind up not even really

822
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,720
taking pto it's

823
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,840
a working vacation so

824
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,600
um yeah

825
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,320
mandatory pto is used in bay it's used

826
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,080
in banks to check people aren't actively

827
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,440
deploying the system that's one of the

828
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,520
advantages of of it is that you can go

829
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,039
ahead and do a check on

830
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,640
a user account etc and stuff like that

831
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,440
but it's it really needs to be done also

832
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,679
to go ahead and let somebody

833
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,399
recharge and refresh if you don't have a

834
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,240
way of recharging and refreshing talk to

835
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,120
friends

836
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,279
start learning so i'm hoping that with

837
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,399
pancakes gone

838
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,559
you've gone ahead and turned around and

839
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,159
found

840
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,159
that you've got a new hobby

841
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,760
or something some new interest whether

842
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,279
it be trains or

843
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,960
mountain climbing or cooking or birding

844
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,919
or djing

845
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,559
so any other question whether on trains

846
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,120
or

847
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,918
on burnout

848
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,200
so i do have another just a

849
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,279
a little bit of curiosity uh you

850
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,399
mentioned the uh

851
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,520
the digitally controlled trains uh

852
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,840
do they signal through the rails or

853
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,159
something like that how does that work

854
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,120
ah yes uh digital command control it

855
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,000
signals through the

856
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,720
rails what it does is it sends a pulse

857
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,159
through the rails so basically

858
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,799
it's it's using the pulses as binary

859
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,159
code

860
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,000
which is why it works so well with

861
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,919
switching over to adreno

862
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,960
or raspberry pi for control systems even

863
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,399
nowadays

864
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:25,360
um so what there's a combat with it also

865
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,720
you can go ahead and run a dc

866
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,320
a non-digital controlled engine on a dcc

867
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,720
track but because of the way the dcc

868
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,240
signals go

869
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,360
if you let that engine idle that that

870
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,320
non-digital

871
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,679
engine idle it will burn up you will

872
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:44,080
burn

873
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,519
out the motor inside of that engine

874
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,399
because of that pulsing

875
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,760
now can you run a dcc engine on a dc

876
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,159
track you can do that very easily in

877
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,840
fact a lot of companies make it so that

878
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,320
way

879
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
certain basic sounds of the engine has

880
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,360
sounds

881
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,159
will automatically run such as whistles

882
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,279
or bells

883
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,559
while you're running it on a dc c trot

884
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,360
but yeah it's it's it's literally a

885
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,840
pulse

886
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,000
inside of the electricity that goes

887
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,760
ahead and sends the signal on

888
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,320
binaries

889
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,320
thank you that's actually really

890
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
fascinating

891
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,399
it's a neat system to go ahead and dig

892
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,480
into i've just started playing with gcc

893
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,000
and i don't have mine set up right at

894
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,200
the moment

895
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,880
but it's it's something that i really

896
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,559
started looking into and then

897
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,640
as i learn more about it i'm tempted to

898
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,039
take the pi or an adreno and start

899
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,799
working with that to see how much better

900
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,399
of a system i can come up with as

901
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,000
opposed to what's just out there right

902
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,240
now

903
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,240
so

904
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,720
if there's nothing else i want to thank

905
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,440
you all for

906
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,600
for listening i hope this came off very

907
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,039
well for everybody and you were able to

908
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,960
learn some stuff

909
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,320
and i'll see you on the rails

910
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,240
fantastic thank you shecky for your

911
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,080
presentation today and for stepping in

912
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,639
for us
