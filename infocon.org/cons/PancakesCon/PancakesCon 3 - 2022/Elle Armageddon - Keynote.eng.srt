and let me just go ahead and share my

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,640
slides

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,960
cool uh so

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,880
i am here today

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,920
to talk to you about two

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,640
myths that are totally false that are

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,880
near and dear to my heart and

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,600
the first is that in order to be

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,159
professional you have to strip away

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,640
everything that makes you who you are

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,560
um and the second is that vegetables are

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,439
terrible these are both horrible

48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,000
horrible lies

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,040
and we're going to talk a little bit

50
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,479
about

51
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,520
how to how to counter those lies

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,040
and

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,880
be professional while still having fun

54
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,479
and eat vegetables because they're

55
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,840
amazing

56
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,320
so who am i uh leslie just gave an

57
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,439
amazing uh introduction um

58
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,360
i am probably several raccoons in a

59
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,240
trench coat and if you're wondering

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,239
why you should listen to what i have to

61
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,520
say about

62
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
professionalism that's a great question

63
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,959
you totally don't have to you can spend

64
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,640
the next 45 minutes just looking at

65
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,879
pictures of vegetables uh on on my

66
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,920
slides

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,040
um

68
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,280
but i am the director of security

69
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,239
engineering at a midsize startup i

70
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,239
currently manage the entire technical

71
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,400
security function for a company with

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,560
about 700 employees

73
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,760
um

74
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,720
managing a team of 10 engineers that i

75
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,040
will be doubling in size over the course

76
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,400
of the next year

77
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,560
um so i do know a little bit about what

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,920
i'm talking about

79
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,760
i'm also an anarchist i am autistic

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,959
um

81
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,599
i am a fresh produce enthusiast and one

82
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,519
of my biggest fears is public speaking

83
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,800
so

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,560
one of the the reasons to listen to what

85
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,640
i have to say is because it's important

86
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,120
enough that i am here facing my fears to

87
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,319
share my thoughts with you all

88
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,800
uh so before we get noted i just want to

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,879
touch on a brief uh note about power

90
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,519
um the more structural power you hold

91
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,519
the greater your obligation to empower

92
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,959
those with less and there are a bunch of

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,319
ways to do this

94
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,640
uh including straight up divesting

95
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,080
yourself of that power and uh giving it

96
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,239
over to people who do have have less

97
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,840
power uh over their own circumstances

98
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
um another reason or another way that

99
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,799
you can do that is through fostering an

100
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,120
environment that has

101
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,959
different um

102
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,680
social expectations than those that are

103
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,200
presented as the cultural norm

104
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,319
or you can do both which is probably the

105
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,640
best way to to proceed

106
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,799
um so let's talk a little bit about what

107
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,959
professionalism has historically meant

108
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,040
um

109
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,319
professionalism has been used as a

110
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,799
weapon to

111
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,360
punish people who don't conform to a

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,480
racist classist sexist

113
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,439
ableist societal norm

114
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,840
and reward those who do

115
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,480
and what that means is that it holds uh

116
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,279
existing oppressive power dynamics

117
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,720
um it can it constructs

118
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,440
barriers to equity and inclusion it

119
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,040
results in homogeneous leadership

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,639
organizations with dangerous and

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,479
avoidable knowledge gaps

122
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,759
um

123
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,320
and it just reinforces the status quo uh

124
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,720
which which is a racist sexist uh

125
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
homophobic

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,080
ableist society

127
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,680
um

128
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,720
so what can we do about it

129
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
there are a whole bunch of myths about

130
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,639
what is and isn't professional but it's

131
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,759
definitely time to retire um

132
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,360
people get told that they have to dress

133
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,800
a certain way in order to be taken

134
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
seriously i know that when i was

135
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,960
starting my career i was told that if i

136
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,080
didn't

137
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,039
stop dressing so femme that no one would

138
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,600
ever take me seriously my response was

139
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,280
to dress more fem

140
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,919
and never let my co-workers see me in

141
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,880
you know flat shoes or without lipstick

142
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,320
um

143
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,639
and it hasn't really hampered my ability

144
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,759
to to be taken seriously um

145
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,120
another

146
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,639
myth it's time to retire is that only

147
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,960
certain hairstyles are appropriate for

148
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,479
professional settings

149
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,880
this is racist this is just straight up

150
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,639
racism

151
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,800
when you set a norm that only certain

152
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,120
hairstyles are acceptable in a

153
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,039
professional environment what you're

154
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,039
actually doing is policing the way that

155
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,800
people of color are able to express

156
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,880
themselves and reflect the cultures that

157
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,280
they come from

158
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,199
and punish their career advancement for

159
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,639
being who they are

160
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,479
it's not acceptable it never was

161
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,800
acceptable and it absolutely needs to

162
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,560
stop today um

163
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,560
you're not allowed to have visible

164
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,080
tattoos or piercings in a lot of

165
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,520
environments

166
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,759
well piercings can certainly be a safety

167
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,680
hazard in some places

168
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,600
it's time to retire the myth that you

169
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,199
can't have visible tattoos or you can't

170
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,600
have piercings um

171
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,880
and you know

172
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,479
sometimes tattoos maybe need to be

173
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,800
covered because of the content of them

174
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,080
um but the concept of tattoos being

175
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,160
this horrible unprofessional thing is

176
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,360
ridiculous

177
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
i've got one

178
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,479
right here shows up on my zoom calls all

179
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,759
the time

180
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,199
um

181
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,639
the use of

182
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,120
expletives or slang is unprofessional is

183
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,560
another myth

184
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
it's i'm telling you

185
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,120
right now you can absolutely curse at

186
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,000
work you can't curse at your co-workers

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
that's unprofessional because it's being

188
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,919
a dick but you can definitely curse in

189
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,680
meetings if cursing is the right way to

190
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,680
express whatever thought you're trying

191
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,880
to share

192
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
um

193
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,240
there are a lot of other myths as well

194
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,840
uh like you should eat sleep live and

195
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,000
breathe your field of expertise you're

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,599
allowed to have hobbies that's a big

197
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,120
part of what this whole conference is

198
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,000
about

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,319
and it turns out that having balanced

200
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,160
hobbies and a balanced lifestyle

201
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,000
actually leads to a more sustainable

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,319
work life for you for you

203
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,599
um

204
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,120
additionally a lot of the things that

205
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,120
you learn from your hobbies you can

206
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,240
translate into work skills as well and

207
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,919
it makes a lot easier to connect with

208
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,080
people outside of your immediate field

209
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,400
if you have something other to talk

210
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,319
other than your your immediate niche of

211
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,319
expertise to talk about

212
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,840
um

213
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,720
leave your personal life at home

214
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,199
that's all well and good and absolutely

215
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,880
you should have some boundaries between

216
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,319
your personal life

217
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,120
and work um but the truth is that things

218
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,919
that are happening in our home lives do

219
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,919
impact our ability to work and it's okay

220
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,599
to be open about them

221
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,639
um if you're having a hard day because

222
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,000
things are rough at home or you're

223
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,080
having a hard day because you were

224
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,840
holding hands with your girlfriend and

225
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,000
someone was a dick about it you're

226
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,759
allowed to tell your teammates about

227
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,599
that

228
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,319
the leave your personal life at home

229
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,879
myth has historically been used to

230
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,080
specifically marginalize

231
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,280
people who are not straight

232
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,759
and it's time to bust that myth as well

233
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,440
and and start bringing our full selves

234
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,560
to work

235
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,840
um

236
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,680
another myth about professionalism is

237
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,280
that some roles are more important than

238
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,039
others and management holds all of the

239
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,000
power

240
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,879
um not only is this totally not true but

241
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,120
you might be thinking that i'm subtly

242
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,320
suggesting that you should unionize

243
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
and you'd be wrong i'm not being subtle

244
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
if you are an individual contributor you

245
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
hold a massive amount of power and you

246
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,760
should absolutely band together with

247
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,200
your colleagues and unionize

248
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,640
so what actually is professionalism

249
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,160
it's actually the art of not being a

250
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,000
jerk but for money

251
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,560
it's pretty simple right

252
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,839
and when you're at work you need to

253
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,680
consider three things uh yourself your

254
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,080
colleagues and management

255
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,600
um

256
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,399
also over on the uh

257
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,959
other side of this slide is an amazing

258
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,560
pot of lentils

259
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,600
um i went ahead and sauteed some

260
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,720
diced onions serrano peppers and ginger

261
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,000
together

262
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,519
and then put them into a crock pot with

263
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,480
black lentils and vegetable broth and

264
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,959
when the lentils got to a nice like uh

265
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,600
doll like consistency um

266
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,240
i stirred in some fresh baby spinach and

267
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,080
let the ambient heat of the lentils kind

268
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,160
of lightly cook the spinach so it's that

269
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,560
perfect like very lightly cooked still

270
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,959
bright green vibrant color

271
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,399
brings a lot of really nice vegetal

272
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,160
notes um

273
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,120
this is an amazing high protein vegan

274
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,080
dish

275
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,480
highly recommend if you're not so much

276
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,000
on the spices you may want to cut it

277
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,080
down on the serrano peppers and use

278
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,760
something like a hatch chili instead

279
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,519
all right so setting yourself up for

280
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,440
success because let's put ourselves

281
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,800
first when we're thinking about

282
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
ourselves our colleagues in management

283
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,279
what does this actually mean um it means

284
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,680
a whole bunch of different things but

285
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,519
one of the uh

286
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,000
most useful things that you can do is

287
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,839
make sure that your unique personality

288
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,399
and perspective which are assets shine

289
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,959
through in the work that you do um when

290
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,720
we build diverse teams we bring

291
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,640
a whole bunch of different views into

292
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,680
the room

293
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,800
um

294
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
and what that means is that there are

295
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,200
more people looking at

296
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,560
problems that we might be missing there

297
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,440
are more people spotting vulnerabilities

298
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,839
it's a really beautiful thing and

299
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,320
your your own threat model and your own

300
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,040
ability to spot risk as a result of your

301
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,640
personal threat model and your personal

302
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,760
perspective

303
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,240
is absolutely a business asset

304
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
when people build homogenous teams what

305
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,920
they're actually doing is constructing

306
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
blind spots and then doing nothing about

307
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,200
them

308
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
and it's really hard to dig yourself out

309
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,079
of

310
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,399
having constructed a homogeneous team

311
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,640
so it's important to build diverse teams

312
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,959
from the ground up um

313
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,519
with that diversity of perspective as a

314
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,399
huge uh priority

315
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,880
um you can also set good boundaries for

316
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,200
yourself this means a whole bunch of

317
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,959
different things including maybe not

318
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,120
having work assets on your personal

319
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,800
phone

320
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,279
or setting working hours for yourself

321
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,200
and not taking meetings outside of those

322
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,079
hours

323
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,160
whatever you need to do in order to make

324
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,640
working sustainable for yourself is

325
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,800
absolutely a reasonable boundary to set

326
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,320
and you should be supported in doing

327
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,519
that

328
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,839
um you should also take breaks when you

329
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,839
need to if you are feeling run down or

330
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,440
exhausted or you've just managed a

331
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,600
several weeks long major security

332
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,640
incident

333
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,200
um that still isn't actually over but

334
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
everyone is bored with so they think

335
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,880
that it's over it might be a good time

336
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,120
to take a a little bit of a break and

337
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,040
take some time off recharge and then

338
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
come back to keep pushing things over

339
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,600
the line so that you don't burn out and

340
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,440
because burnout is really really hard to

341
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,360
recover from and a lot of people are

342
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
experiencing it right now

343
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,560
the only way that you can actually

344
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,040
survive burnout and keep your career

345
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,720
alive is to take those breaks when you

346
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,079
do need them

347
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,120
um

348
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,920
you can set goals that challenge you

349
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,880
and then ask for help achieving them

350
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,440
i'm again speaking to you today despite

351
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,079
my absolute fear of public speaking

352
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,160
because it's a goal that i have to not

353
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,560
be afraid anymore um

354
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,959
and the amazing staff here at pancakes

355
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,240
con has been

356
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,959
super supportive and kind um

357
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,880
and are helping me work towards that

358
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,720
goal of not being scared anymore because

359
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,320
i still have professional development to

360
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,600
do too

361
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,360
um

362
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,440
you can do things that scare you until

363
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,760
they aren't scary anymore right

364
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,720
um you can know your worth and not let

365
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,360
anybody talk you out of it uh this comes

366
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,920
in really handy both when uh you're

367
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,480
negotiating salary at a new role or

368
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,440
advocating for a promotion for yourself

369
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,079
um but it also is really important to

370
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,720
keep in mind when you're being asked to

371
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,200
do something that isn't appropriate

372
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,600
or um

373
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,680
seeing your work minimized or seeing

374
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,440
other people getting credit for your

375
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,240
work

376
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,680
there there are a whole bunch of ways

377
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
where knowing your own worth and then

378
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
feeling empowered to speak up because

379
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,160
you know what you're worth uh plays out

380
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,760
in the workplace

381
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,920
um and it's important to never lose

382
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,760
sight of it

383
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,720
um

384
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,040
admit when you don't know something so

385
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,200
that you don't lose opportunities to

386
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,839
grow and learn um it's okay to not know

387
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,399
things i don't know things all of the

388
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,800
time i ask questions sometimes they're

389
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,839
stupid questions

390
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,920
but it's more important to admit that

391
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,839
you don't know something and then

392
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,040
go and learn

393
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,480
than it is to pretend that you know

394
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,160
everything because if you pretend that

395
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,360
you know everything and then proceed

396
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,839
accordingly you're gonna it up

397
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,040
um

398
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,120
people are so much more likely to be

399
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,079
willing to answer stupid questions and

400
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,839
help you learn things if you haven't

401
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,839
already created a mess that they have to

402
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,360
go clean up

403
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,639
um

404
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,880
and also surround yourself with people

405
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,040
who want to see you succeed badly enough

406
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,240
to tell you when you are up

407
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,480
um and if we look over to the other side

408
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,160
of this slide here

409
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,920
uh we have a lovely uh

410
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,480
leafless salad

411
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,600
this is nice slices of golden beet blood

412
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,720
orange

413
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,079
red beet and pink grapefruit

414
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,959
with

415
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,279
salted pistachio crumbles

416
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,360
or salted pistachios and goat cheese

417
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,199
crumble and then it's lightly dressed

418
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,760
with a balsamic reduction

419
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,399
and i highly recommend these are all

420
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,880
amazing winter produce that are

421
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,000
available right now in most places

422
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
it's a delicious salad year round you

423
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,160
just want to roast those beets nicely uh

424
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,399
so that they're kind of silky and

425
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,880
soft instead of being super crunchy

426
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,680
um brings out the sweetness

427
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,440
of flavor which is balanced by a nice

428
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,639
earthiness

429
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,560
um and then you've got some some you

430
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,360
know bright tart notes from the citrus

431
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,279
really a beautiful salad can't recommend

432
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,880
enough this is one of my favorites

433
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,680
um so following your moral compass is

434
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,839
also really important to being a

435
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,279
professional

436
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,600
and prioritizing yourself

437
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
and what that means is that you don't

438
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,800
actually have to know what you're doing

439
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,720
all the time but you do have to know

440
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,120
what you won't be doing you have to know

441
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,560
where your own lines are um and feel

442
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,079
empowered to

443
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,680
not cross them

444
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,920
um so what does that mean

445
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,120
in practice it means being consistent

446
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,600
being authentic

447
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
it means not making commitments that you

448
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,759
can't deliver on whether it's because

449
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,720
you're overworked already and just don't

450
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,759
have any more capacity to take on work

451
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,680
or because you're being asked to do

452
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,600
something that you don't feel you can

453
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,120
ethically execute on um don't make

454
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,519
commitments that you can't follow up on

455
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,360
own your mistakes

456
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,240
um

457
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,279
admit when you've messed up ideally as

458
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,600
soon as you know that you've messed up

459
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,000
um so that instead of you know trying to

460
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,079
fix it yourself and and making a problem

461
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,639
worse you can get colleagues to help

462
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,279
um and learn from the opportunity again

463
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,839
instead of of making it a big enough

464
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,360
mess that other people have to actually

465
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,120
clean it up for you

466
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,560
um

467
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,399
you can be accountable to yourself and

468
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,160
others and it's really important to be

469
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
accountable to yourself and to admit

470
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,759
your own faults

471
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,720
um and to accept them and figure out how

472
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,480
you're going to

473
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
improve on them um so that you can

474
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,720
continue to live with yourself the most

475
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,240
important thing that you have to be able

476
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,320
to do at the end of any day is still

477
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,240
look at yourself in the mirror

478
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,639
um and be proud of the decisions that

479
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,480
you've made

480
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,600
and if you can't be proud of the

481
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,760
decisions that you have made then it's

482
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,400
time to take a step back and ask

483
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,240
what other decisions you could have made

484
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,919
and and what you would do differently

485
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,160
next time and then really commit to it

486
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,559
accountability isn't being infallible

487
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,359
it's committing to the actual growth

488
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,359
after you've made mistakes

489
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,559
um

490
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,720
the last thing that you can do

491
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,799
to follow your moral compass and be a

492
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,760
professional is say no to things flat

493
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,039
out they're in conflict with your

494
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,600
principles um

495
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,480
for a lot of people this means a lot of

496
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,240
different things and i'm not here to

497
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,360
define

498
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,440
where your moral compass points

499
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,160
um but i can tell you a few things that

500
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,200
i have said no to um

501
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,280
i won't work for ice i will not work for

502
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,039
an organization that is maintaining

503
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,440
concentration camps at the borders of

504
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,760
our countries i won't do it um this

505
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,559
means i also wouldn't work for dhs

506
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,679
because ice is a sub-organization of dhs

507
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,880
um

508
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,400
i wouldn't work for a company that is

509
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,320
knowingly and willfully disseminating

510
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,240
disinformation

511
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,600
about politics or pandemic safety or

512
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,440
vaccines

513
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,039
regardless of how

514
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,240
well that

515
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,280
policy

516
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,200
drives engagement

517
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,559
um

518
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,799
and i also won't work to build tech for

519
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,200
law enforcement agencies these are some

520
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,440
of my personal things that i refuse to

521
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,679
do and you have your own lines that you

522
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,919
can set and refuse to cross

523
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,039
um and as i mentioned a few slides back

524
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,760
you do hold a massive amount of power

525
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,960
um

526
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,280
and you you have the ability to withhold

527
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,000
your skills and your expertise

528
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,919
and not do things that are in conflict

529
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,240
with who you are as a person

530
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,360
um

531
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,000
one of the most common arguments to this

532
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
is that if you don't do it someone else

533
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,919
will and you know what that might be

534
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,679
true but it doesn't have to be your

535
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,960
problem

536
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,520
if somebody else will do it fine that's

537
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,799
on them

538
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,559
but you don't have to participate in

539
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,400
things that are morally morally

540
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,280
reprehensible to you um

541
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
and over on the other side of this slide

542
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,520
we have a lovely vegan butternut squash

543
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,840
bisque i like to go ahead and roast the

544
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
butternut squash before combining it

545
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,480
with vegetable stock

546
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,799
and some roasted shallots uh and then

547
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,120
taking the immersion blender to it and

548
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,720
if you're wondering kind of what's going

549
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,200
on with that topping there i like to use

550
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,440
a lemon infused olive oil to kind of

551
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,520
bring some brightness to the flavor

552
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,559
um

553
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,720
and those are some toasted pumpkin seeds

554
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,880
because lightly salted pepitas provide a

555
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,280
nice crunch um

556
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
the saltiness is fantastic and also

557
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,160
they're

558
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,760
really great fats and proteins

559
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,760
so what does it mean to be a team player

560
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,559
uh

561
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,640
make sure that everyone is included this

562
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,360
can mean everything from not using

563
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,000
language that is inherently exclusive to

564
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,080
people in your organization

565
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,280
um

566
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,360
a big one that comes out of people's

567
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,240
mouths on literally a daily basis uh in

568
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,600
my professional life is you guys

569
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,760
i'm not a guy and i'm usually not the

570
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,000
only person in the room who's not a guy

571
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,120
um

572
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,799
and i don't feel included when somebody

573
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,799
addresses room and says you guys it

574
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,760
makes me feel like my my thoughts aren't

575
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,000
being uh solicited when someone asks

576
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,919
what do you guys think

577
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,200
um

578
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,320
obviously using openly racist sexist

579
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,280
homophobic transphobic ableist

580
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,520
um or otherwise oppressive language is

581
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,320
another way where people get excluded um

582
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,240
don't do this

583
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,919
and sometimes you might it up and

584
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,360
you might say something accidentally

585
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,559
that's exclusive

586
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,360
and the best way to deal with that is to

587
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,400
take any pushback as a compliment and a

588
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,480
vote of confidence that you are able to

589
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,600
do better

590
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,720
um

591
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,919
and to say

592
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,200
i'm sorry

593
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
correct yourself

594
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
and then proceed

595
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,520
um this

596
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,000
this makes it so that not only are you

597
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,919
correcting your own actions and being

598
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,840
accountable for your mistake but you're

599
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,520
not putting whoever is correcting you in

600
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,320
a in a place of having to tell you that

601
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,880
it's okay that you use language that's

602
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,640
exclusive to them

603
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,320
um

604
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,000
you know you can also find a middle

605
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,400
ground between independence and asking

606
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,520
for help

607
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,799
and this is something that i actually

608
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,480
talk to with my early and career

609
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,039
engineers or talk about with my early

610
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,000
career engineers really frequently um

611
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,640
because they do want to solve problems

612
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,159
on their own and they do want to be

613
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,480
empowered to find answers and i want to

614
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,559
provide that environment for them

615
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,400
but there's a huge difference between

616
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,720
looking at something for a day or two

617
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280
days and you know giving it a night to

618
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
sleep on um

619
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
to see if you have any breakthroughs

620
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,760
versus not making any progress over the

621
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,679
course of a week or two

622
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,559
and then being behind on deadlines

623
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,919
and so what i would say is find that

624
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,720
sweet spot that middle ground where

625
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,720
you aren't immediately going and asking

626
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,320
your colleagues questions that you could

627
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,360
google

628
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,559
um

629
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,360
but you are also making sure to

630
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,039
limit your trying to solve the problem

631
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,320
yourself to a reasonable time frame um

632
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,480
and aren't aren't setting yourself back

633
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,120
in being stubborn about not asking for

634
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,400
help

635
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,679
um

636
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,760
respect your peers time

637
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,880
um this can mean everything from

638
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,000
being cognizant of time zones in this

639
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,240
you know mostly remote world that we

640
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,440
live in um and not scheduling meetings

641
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,320
over your co-workers lunch hours or

642
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,159
outside of their working hours

643
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,039
um

644
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,120
to just staying on track in meetings um

645
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,679
and not letting deviations from meetings

646
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,600
make the meeting itself useless to

647
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,280
everyone involved

648
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,720
um

649
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
document what you learn so that others

650
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,200
can benefit from it too it's really good

651
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,679
and exciting for our workplaces to be a

652
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,120
place where

653
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,799
we can learn and grow

654
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,880
but it doesn't serve anybody if every

655
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,400
single person who comes into that

656
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,200
workplace has to learn the same lesson

657
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,120
independently over and over and over

658
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,080
again

659
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,320
so when you do take the time to learn

660
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,120
something new right

661
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,760
excuse me

662
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,200
write it down um put it somewhere with a

663
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,960
reasonable name so that it's easily

664
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,159
findable

665
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,400
and give your colleagues the benefit of

666
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,480
the learning that you have have gone and

667
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,520
done

668
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,918
um

669
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,799
communicate clearly uh

670
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,279
and make sure that you're communicating

671
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,960
um

672
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,559
in a way that actually makes sense to

673
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,919
your audience

674
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:52,960
um

675
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,799
just make sure that you know when you

676
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,480
use words they're words that make sense

677
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,000
to whoever it is that you're trying to

678
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
explain a concept to

679
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,520
um

680
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
and make sure that when problems are

681
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,760
cropping up you're clearly communicating

682
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,000
those as well so that everybody around

683
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,720
you knows what their expectations around

684
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,880
timelines should be um and if you do

685
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,640
need help with something they know that

686
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,480
you need that help and they can step in

687
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,320
to provide it or they can say something

688
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,760
like

689
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,159
hey i can't get to that right this

690
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,679
second

691
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,400
i have time after you know 4 p.m

692
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,159
can this wait until then

693
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,600
but making sure that you're bringing up

694
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,400
problems early and often um

695
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,120
and just setting clear expectations

696
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,640
goes a really long way to being an

697
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,240
excellent teammate

698
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
um we've already talked about owning

699
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,120
your mistakes but it means just as much

700
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,880
to the team as it does

701
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,120
to your own self

702
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,480
for you to own your mistakes and be

703
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,360
accountable for them

704
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,919
help ensure that your peers are being

705
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,120
heard and credited for their

706
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,559
contributions

707
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,400
this one is actually really important if

708
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,760
you are trying to maintain a diverse

709
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,720
team

710
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,559
um

711
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,760
everybody has that person who is you

712
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,679
know really outspoken and everyone knows

713
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,440
all of their opinions i'm often that

714
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,480
person

715
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,679
um every team also has someone who is

716
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,159
maybe a little shy and hasn't hesitant

717
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,600
to speak up

718
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,799
um

719
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,559
and not only does this mean that that

720
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,960
person's ideas aren't necessarily heard

721
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,480
by the collective

722
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
it also often means that they don't get

723
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
credited for their contributions to the

724
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,080
group when they make them

725
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,039
um so some things that you can do are to

726
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,200
actively solicit feedback from people in

727
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,720
meetings who you've noticed aren't

728
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,159
talking much

729
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,600
um

730
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,799
and then when they do make suggestions

731
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,960
repeat things um so say hey

732
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,600
leslie i really liked that suggestion

733
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,000
that we do x y and z

734
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,200
um so that whoever that person is is not

735
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,840
just having their opinion heard

736
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,840
um but is actually being credited and

737
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,679
it's not getting misattributed to

738
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,320
someone else who is maybe more outspoken

739
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,600
um

740
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,760
share the uninteresting work we all have

741
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,000
work that nobody likes doing and it kind

742
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,120
of sucks

743
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,480
um

744
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,919
one of the things that comes to mind for

745
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,080
me is on-call work

746
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,039
um

747
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,080
and everybody in my org including me is

748
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,799
in an on-call rotation um because the

749
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,559
only way to make that uninteresting or

750
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,880
kind of crappy work sustainable for

751
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,200
anybody is for everybody to do their

752
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,080
part

753
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,360
um

754
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,919
be considerate in your feedback

755
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,320
this means framing things in ways that

756
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,720
your co-workers can actually hear it

757
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,840
means not being needlessly cruel for you

758
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,440
know in the interest of being honest you

759
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,840
can be honest and kind

760
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,880
um

761
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
and it also means focusing on giving

762
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,640
feedback that people can actually take

763
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,880
action on instead of saying

764
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,320
this was bad

765
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,520
um

766
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,360
so providing if you think something was

767
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,440
bad provide some suggestions instead of

768
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,840
just saying this suck you suck you are

769
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,960
bad and you should feel bad um

770
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,000
and then

771
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,919
don't over commit

772
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,400
be aware of how much is already on your

773
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,320
plate and when you are asked if you can

774
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,240
take on extra work

775
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,159
evaluate whether or not you can actually

776
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,399
do it and do a good job of it before

777
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,799
saying yes to it um

778
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,279
it makes a huge difference and i promise

779
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,799
that your co-workers would rather you

780
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,840
say no

781
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,679
than say yes to something and then drop

782
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,159
the ball on everything

783
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,440
sorry i forgot to describe my salad

784
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,080
so here we have a half of a sliced

785
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,200
avocado sitting on a bed of mixed greens

786
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,080
with roasted red beets watermelon radish

787
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,840
cherry tomatoes toasted pepitas um

788
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,000
and then this is dressed with a

789
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,480
really nice light

790
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,960
citrus vinaigrette i used meyer lemon

791
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,039
juice um

792
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,799
mustard

793
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,760
uh champagne vinegar um and some salt

794
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,679
and pepper um

795
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,039
and i went ahead and just dressed the

796
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,559
lettuce before putting everything else

797
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,080
on top of it so that it would still look

798
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,880
pretty

799
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,200
um it's one of my favorite salads as

800
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,360
well it's just it's it's fantastic

801
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,158
highly recommend

802
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
so how can you be a great peer to people

803
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,440
outside of your team because

804
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,880
colleagues aren't just the people that

805
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,960
you work with every single day they're

806
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
the people who make the company that you

807
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,720
work for function

808
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,640
uh everybody that you work with is your

809
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,039
colleague every single person regardless

810
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,200
of their role regardless of their title

811
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,520
they are a colleague um

812
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,960
and you should treat all of them with

813
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,919
equal respect

814
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,320
you have an obligation to treat some of

815
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,679
them with more respect than others and

816
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,120
it's probably not in the direction that

817
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,440
you think um

818
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,600
if you are going to

819
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
you know give different people different

820
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,200
amounts of respect um the people who are

821
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,559
looked down on are the ones that you

822
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,399
should treat with the most respect

823
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,679
um

824
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,039
it's you know not it's not a secret that

825
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,799
in in tech

826
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,000
um

827
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,840
there is uh

828
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,799
an implicit and sometimes explicit

829
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,720
hierarchy between people who work in

830
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,399
engineering and everybody else

831
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,840
you don't have a job without the people

832
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,000
who don't work in engineering you don't

833
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,840
have a job without the people who work

834
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,520
in sales you don't have a job without

835
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,559
the people who work in finance

836
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,960
their work is every bit as important as

837
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,000
yours

838
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,679
um and so if you are going to um treat

839
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,760
people with unequal amounts of respect

840
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,559
be sure to prioritize treating

841
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,720
the people who are doing

842
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,960
less glamorous work with more respect um

843
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,840
managers get plenty of respect

844
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,880
you don't have to worry about them

845
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,320
nearly as much um

846
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,279
so

847
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,600
how to be a great peer um

848
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,520
know what your organization is trying to

849
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,640
accomplish um and then how you fit into

850
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,440
it

851
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,240
um build meaningful relationships

852
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,039
outside of your team um

853
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,080
so

854
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,760
in order to understand what what your

855
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,159
company is trying to accomplish which

856
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,520
let's be real we live in a capitalist

857
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,880
society what your company is trying to

858
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,960
accomplish is making more money and

859
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,840
getting bigger

860
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,919
um but understanding how you fit into

861
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,640
that plan um and then

862
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,880
what your co-workers are also doing to

863
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,720
achieve that is really really useful um

864
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,200
learn how your colleagues work

865
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,760
and what they're trying to accomplish

866
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,960
um

867
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,760
and

868
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,679
consider the impact that your work has

869
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,360
on other people

870
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,120
this is actually really really useful

871
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,840
and i think it gets overlooked a ton and

872
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,320
you can't design effective security

873
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,919
controls if you don't know what your

874
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,360
colleagues are doing

875
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,039
you can't design effective security

876
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,000
controls if you don't know how they work

877
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,880
what they're trying to accomplish

878
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,960
or what deliverables they need to

879
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,080
provide at the end of the day

880
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,120
if you want to implement security

881
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,799
controls that people will actually work

882
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,880
with you have to understand what they're

883
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,440
doing you have to talk to your peers i

884
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
can't overstate this enough you have to

885
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,960
talk to your peers

886
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,880
um

887
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,320
communicate in ways that make sense to

888
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,919
your audience

889
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,600
um

890
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,440
you and i could probably have an amazing

891
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,519
conversation about log4j and the

892
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,039
implications of it

893
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,440
but if you go to basically

894
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,600
anybody else even the engineering

895
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,840
organization the likelihood of them

896
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,080
understanding the security implications

897
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,799
and scope of the log4j incident

898
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,279
is nearly nothing so you have to be sure

899
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,640
that if you are trying to get a point

900
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,760
across

901
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,679
rather than using the technical terms

902
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,320
that make sense to you and me and our

903
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,080
immediate colleagues

904
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,600
you're actually speaking to people in

905
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,600
terms that they can understand because

906
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,760
the the point of communication is to

907
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,720
share ideas and get both parties on the

908
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,080
same page it's not to sound super smart

909
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,760
um

910
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,000
so the more simple your communications

911
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,760
are the better they're going to land the

912
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
more effective they'll be

913
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,080
um

914
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,240
give relevant and applicable guidance

915
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,480
um this comes back to the same thing as

916
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,080
designing security controls that make

917
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,200
sense

918
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,760
don't tell your co-workers in sales not

919
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,000
to open emails and click links that's

920
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,240
their job that's their entire job their

921
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,399
job is opening emails and clicking links

922
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,480
so instead of telling them

923
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,120
don't open things and don't click links

924
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,960
have conversations with your peers about

925
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,360
how to spot sketchy emails and what to

926
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,559
do if they do open one and click links

927
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,640
and because people are going to mess up

928
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,720
they are going to make mistakes and the

929
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,120
point isn't to go well i told you so i

930
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,559
told you not to open emails and click

931
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,440
links

932
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,279
the point is to have

933
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,960
clear and open lines of communication

934
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,480
with people so that when they do make a

935
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,080
mistake they know they can come to you

936
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,159
for help fixing it

937
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,120
um

938
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,000
build guardrails not roadblocks

939
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,080
as we are designing security controls we

940
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,360
want to make sure that instead of

941
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,440
preventing our peers from doing their

942
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,919
jobs we're facilitating them doing their

943
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,559
jobs in the most secure way possible

944
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,760
um

945
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
and then remember that everyone has

946
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,360
something to teach and something to

947
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,240
learn

948
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,559
every single person on this planet knows

949
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,320
something that you don't and you know

950
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,360
something that they don't so rather than

951
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,440
having this like weird oh but i work in

952
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,919
security and nobody knows or cares

953
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,440
attitude

954
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,039
develop an attitude of intellectual

955
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,840
curiosity um get to know your co-workers

956
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,080
find out what they know and tell them

957
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,960
what you know share instead of you know

958
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,320
writing people off because they don't

959
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,879
know things

960
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,320
um so this salad here we've got uh

961
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,879
mixed cherry tomatoes with slices of

962
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,440
cucumber purple daikon radish

963
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,639
um

964
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,040
and a crumble of feta cheese on mixed

965
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,639
greens this is just really lightly

966
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,679
dressed with a drizzle of nice olive oil

967
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,000
and really nice balsamic vinegar

968
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,199
um

969
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,079
and if you look uh there are also some

970
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,839
marigold petals in there i really like

971
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,320
using flowers in my cooking when i can

972
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,520
um

973
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,040
the feta crumbles add a nice like

974
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,359
saltiness to the

975
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,280
salad um

976
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,079
which kind of makes a more um

977
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,560
robust dressing not as necessary

978
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,119
um and you know colors are always great

979
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,440
so we're coming back to this note on

980
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,040
power um

981
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
before i get into

982
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,839
uh

983
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,000
talking about managers

984
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,560
um again the more structural power you

985
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
hold the greater your obligation to

986
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,240
empower those with less

987
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,920
so i'm not going to sit here and tell

988
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,839
you how to treat your managers with

989
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,000
respect i'm going to tell you how your

990
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,480
managers should be treating you um

991
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,800
and what you should expect from a good

992
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,920
manager

993
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,359
um if you are a manager um i really hope

994
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,960
that you'll take this next slide as a

995
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,040
challenge um

996
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,280
and do your best to live up to the

997
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,599
description on it um if you're already

998
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,040
living up to the description on it or

999
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,960
you have things that you'd like to add

1000
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
please let me know i'm fairly new to

1001
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,960
being a manager um

1002
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,200
and you know i'm i'm doing my best but i

1003
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,520
also am always here to learn and grow

1004
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,800
um

1005
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,320
so what to expect from your manager

1006
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,200
um

1007
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,880
honesty and respect

1008
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,560
your manager should be treating you with

1009
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,599
respect

1010
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,280
if they're not treating you with respect

1011
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,480
they're not doing their job

1012
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,040
clear communication of expectations and

1013
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,320
actionable feedback about your

1014
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,520
performance

1015
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,680
your performance reviews should never be

1016
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,960
a surprise

1017
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,720
you should know what your performance

1018
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,280
review is going to look like based on

1019
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,200
the one-on-ones that you're having on a

1020
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,720
regular cadence

1021
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,040
where not only do you talk about what

1022
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,880
you need from your manager in order to

1023
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,480
do your job

1024
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,800
um but where your manager lets you know

1025
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,480
how you're doing

1026
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,200
against the expectations that they have

1027
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,119
um

1028
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,200
you should have frequent alignment on

1029
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,040
priorities again you should be meeting

1030
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,200
with your manager regularly

1031
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,359
um and if you are getting off track

1032
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,800
that's a conversation that should be

1033
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,720
happening sooner rather than later and

1034
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,880
they should be initiating it

1035
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,079
um

1036
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,000
you should be getting support in problem

1037
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,560
solving if you are hitting a roadblock

1038
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,800
your manager should be actively helping

1039
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,119
you figure out how to

1040
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,920
deconstruct it climb over it

1041
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,440
climb around it

1042
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,920
or figure some other way out to ensure

1043
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,359
that you're not being blocked on your

1044
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,680
work

1045
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,280
protection from interference your

1046
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,160
manager should actively be preventing

1047
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,720
external external entities from giving

1048
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,240
you dumb tasks

1049
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,440
um

1050
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,680
your manager should also be preventing

1051
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,680
anybody from disrupting the work that

1052
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,760
you're doing um this is a big part of

1053
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,720
their job it goes hand in hand with uh

1054
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,320
support and problem solving and clearing

1055
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,560
roadblocks your manager should also be

1056
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,640
proactively preventing roadblocks from

1057
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,440
being

1058
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,960
dropped in your way whenever and

1059
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,880
wherever possible

1060
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,160
um

1061
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,040
open sharing of relevant information if

1062
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,800
your manager has information that

1063
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,320
affects you they should be telling you

1064
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,359
that

1065
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,720
um

1066
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,599
there is very little to be gained from

1067
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,800
not being transparent with your

1068
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,240
reports

1069
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,280
and the only case where it is

1070
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,599
really acceptable to not be transparent

1071
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,680
is if the information that you aren't

1072
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,960
sharing is not your information to share

1073
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,800
um so an example is if somebody has told

1074
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
you something in confidence it's not

1075
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,040
appropriate to share that

1076
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,640
but pretty much everything else if it

1077
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,240
affects your staff you should be telling

1078
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,240
them

1079
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,720
trust in the abilities and expertise of

1080
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,200
your team

1081
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,320
you as a as an individual contributor

1082
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,400
are a subject matter expert and it's

1083
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,320
your manager's job to have faith in your

1084
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,640
expertise um

1085
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,000
and this is something that definitely

1086
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,520
goes both ways

1087
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,440
you're already committing to

1088
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,400
not

1089
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,920
bullshitting about the things that you

1090
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,440
do and don't know

1091
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,200
um and as long as you're committing to

1092
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
being honest about what you know your

1093
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,880
manager should actually trust the things

1094
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,640
that you are telling them

1095
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,240
um that doesn't mean that they should

1096
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,079
never ask questions

1097
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,599
but it does mean that they should have

1098
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,119
faith in you and they should also have

1099
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,960
faith in you to execute on your job

1100
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,320
instead of breathing over your shoulder

1101
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,760
constantly asking

1102
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,359
are we there yet

1103
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,599
are we there yet

1104
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,079
how about now

1105
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,440
that attitude doesn't actually help

1106
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,040
anyone it just makes things take longer

1107
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,400
um

1108
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,760
explaining the rationale behind

1109
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,079
decisions um

1110
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,560
if if your manager has made a decision

1111
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,320
and you don't understand it you should

1112
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,720
feel empowered to ask hey can you help

1113
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,240
me understand the rationale behind this

1114
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,240
decision and your manager should go oh

1115
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,760
yeah totally and then they should

1116
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,160
explain it if your manager can't explain

1117
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,000
themselves to their staff

1118
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,440
they're not doing their job very well um

1119
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,680
and you know i understand that some

1120
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,440
people think that being asked to explain

1121
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,760
their decisions is a challenge

1122
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,119
of their

1123
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,599
authority or knowledge or whatever

1124
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,760
but if you can't explain

1125
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,240
why you made a decision that you made

1126
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,440
how much knowledge do you actually have

1127
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,320
um

1128
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,000
your manager should be advocating for

1129
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
your needs they should support you in

1130
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
maintaining your boundaries um and they

1131
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,079
should be asking active questions about

1132
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,720
your career goals if your manager isn't

1133
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,400
asking you

1134
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,359
what you want to do next um what you

1135
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,359
want to be learning what you don't want

1136
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,040
to be doing

1137
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,640
they're they're only doing part of their

1138
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,599
job

1139
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,839
because a huge part of what it means to

1140
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,000
be a manager is to support the growth of

1141
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,079
the people that you are managing

1142
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,560
um they won't always work for you

1143
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,200
personally and so it's important to

1144
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,040
spend the time that you do have together

1145
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,640
giving them the tools that they need for

1146
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,359
whatever comes next

1147
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,640
managers should be giving you

1148
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,560
opportunities for growth and they should

1149
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,960
also be constructing a safe environment

1150
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,960
for you to fail and learn in

1151
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,599
um and what that means is that your

1152
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,599
managers should be challenging you but

1153
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,440
they shouldn't be giving you high stakes

1154
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,119
things that you don't know how to do and

1155
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,800
then not supporting you and delivering

1156
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,920
on them

1157
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,359
um

1158
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,720
everybody makes mistakes everybody fails

1159
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,000
um it's it's not bad or wrong to make

1160
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,079
mistakes or to fail at things it's bad

1161
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,480
and wrong to

1162
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
not support people in things that they

1163
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,560
don't have a good chance of succeeding

1164
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,280
at

1165
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,560
and it's also

1166
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
not great to

1167
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,079
make the same mistake over and over and

1168
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,920
over again and fail in the exact same

1169
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,200
way over and over and over again and

1170
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,040
never learn anything from it

1171
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,880
so it is really important to have an

1172
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,839
environment where it is safe to fail

1173
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,760
um and where the conversation around the

1174
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,800
failure is entirely centered around how

1175
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,839
to not do it again

1176
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,440
sorry this is a uh burrata um which is a

1177
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,119
like cream-filled

1178
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,040
fresh mozzarella

1179
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,319
um

1180
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,800
with slices of this gorgeous purple

1181
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,119
tomato that had this like pink and green

1182
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,760
uh interior flesh it was amazing

1183
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,040
um

1184
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,960
i have sprinkled it with a little bit of

1185
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,960
alderwood smoked salt

1186
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,440
um and some pepper

1187
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,520
and just given it a nice you know light

1188
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,000
drizzle of that balsamic reduction um

1189
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,240
and some lemon olive oil as well

1190
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,440
um

1191
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,880
we've just got a little bit of a

1192
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,040
sourdough toast there to to kind of

1193
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,960
round everything out it's an amazing

1194
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,640
super quick easy meal

1195
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,280
um i did eat that entire burrata it was

1196
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,640
amazing uh it was very filling um but

1197
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,359
yeah super quick easy meal tomatoes are

1198
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,839
amazing and you should love them

1199
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,079
especially if you can get you know

1200
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,079
really good fresh ones that are actually

1201
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,920
in season which these totally work

1202
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,680
um so a few helpful phrases for

1203
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,839
maintaining professionalism um in the

1204
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,160
workplace um

1205
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,359
can you help me understand

1206
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,880
the context behind this decision

1207
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,920
this is the polite way of saying

1208
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,119
what the were you thinking um and

1209
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,520
while it totally is okay to curse in

1210
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,040
professional settings sometimes

1211
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,560
generally speaking you're not supposed

1212
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,480
to curse at your colleagues as i have

1213
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,680
mentioned

1214
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,720
um

1215
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,800
and it's also difficult to get good

1216
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,800
answers or

1217
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,400
proactive action

1218
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,720
if you come at interactions with people

1219
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,400
about questionable decisions from a

1220
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,040
place of accusation

1221
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,720
so instead of approaching people with

1222
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,720
the assumption that they are dumb and

1223
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,000
wrong

1224
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,280
uh you should approach them with

1225
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,280
intellectual curiosity

1226
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,839
um assume that there was

1227
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,040
some kind of reasoning behind a choice

1228
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,440
that was made and maybe was not a good

1229
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,400
one

1230
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,440
um and asked to understand what

1231
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,440
led up to that decision being made

1232
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,040
instead of asking what the were you

1233
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,880
thinking

1234
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,200
um what are the outcomes you'd like to

1235
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,640
achieve

1236
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,160
this is a really great way to ask

1237
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,520
what are you trying to do here

1238
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,960
um again in a way that is um

1239
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,760
intellectually curious and assumes that

1240
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
there is something reasonable going on

1241
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,319
and you just don't understand what it is

1242
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,440
um

1243
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,240
this is really helpful when you're being

1244
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,440
given a task that makes no sense

1245
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,319
um

1246
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,480
or that doesn't make any sense to you

1247
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,119
and this is also really helpful when it

1248
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,520
seems like somebody maybe may have a

1249
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,680
solution they've latched on to and maybe

1250
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,839
seeking a problem to apply the solution

1251
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:30,720
to

1252
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,400
um instead of

1253
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,560
finding a problem and trying to create a

1254
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,280
solution to that problem

1255
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,560
um what stakeholders have you solicited

1256
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,400
feedback from

1257
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,119
is a great way to ask um

1258
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,200
who does this work impact um and

1259
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,880
have you checked in with the people who

1260
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,960
you're about to interfere with

1261
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,640
um it's really great

1262
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,640
especially in terms of

1263
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,160
security controls being introduced that

1264
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,000
maybe don't make a ton of sense or that

1265
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,079
are going to have negative impact on

1266
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,440
colleagues that said the security

1267
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,720
organization

1268
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,079
um

1269
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,319
it's also a great question when somebody

1270
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,800
is proposing something just absolutely

1271
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,560
 insane

1272
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,480
um and you want a good way to kind of

1273
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,800
push back and say like i i think that we

1274
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,880
should get feedback from some more

1275
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,760
people before we proceed with this

1276
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,280
um

1277
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,200
which of my current projects would you

1278
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,440
like me to drop in order to prioritize

1279
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,400
this

1280
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,480
this one's really useful for the

1281
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,079
managers who maybe aren't super great at

1282
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,319
knowing what their teams are working on

1283
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,920
if your manager is trying to assign more

1284
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,599
work to you and you're already at

1285
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,800
capacity this is a really great way to

1286
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,599
a subtly enforce a boundary of you know

1287
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,359
i'm already at capacity i can't take on

1288
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:50,640
anything more

1289
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,839
but b also help remind that person

1290
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,359
of all of the other things that you're

1291
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,240
already working on

1292
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,880
it may be that they've forgotten

1293
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,319
it may be that the thing that they're

1294
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,240
asking you to do actually is higher

1295
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,680
priority than something else that you're

1296
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,880
working on

1297
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,640
um and it's a really great opportunity

1298
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,200
to realign whatever priorities you think

1299
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,640
you have versus what priorities your

1300
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,400
manager thinks you have

1301
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,119
and make sure that you agree on both

1302
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,040
um

1303
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,200
i need to sign off from legal in order

1304
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,040
to proceed

1305
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,200
this is the polite way of saying that's

1306
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,280
 illegal and i don't want to get

1307
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,560
sued over this um

1308
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,400
you will get asked to do things in your

1309
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,839
career that are

1310
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,240
at best legally questionable and it's

1311
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,079
always okay to kick the ball over to

1312
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,000
legal and say

1313
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,720
hey i'm being asked to do this did you

1314
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,680
know about this um and let them come in

1315
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,280
and say no

1316
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,240
um or you know maybe legal will say yes

1317
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,000
to the thing that you are being asked to

1318
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,760
do and you know that it's time to update

1319
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,599
your resume and find somewhere else to

1320
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:56,800
be

1321
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,240
um

1322
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,480
and finally i'm afraid that won't be

1323
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,240
possible

1324
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,200
this is a really really wonderful way to

1325
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,839
say no just straight up no i'm not doing

1326
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,119
that um

1327
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,920
it is not apologetic it is a firm

1328
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,319
boundary where you know

1329
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,400
i'm afraid this won't be possible

1330
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,800
is um

1331
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,880
a way for you to assert that you will

1332
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,720
not be doing whatever the thing that you

1333
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,400
are being asked to do is and there are a

1334
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,079
multitude of reasons that you might want

1335
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,760
to use this term

1336
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,720
um

1337
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,640
all of them are valid just

1338
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,720
make sure that you don't

1339
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,559
say i'm afraid that that won't be

1340
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,520
possible um to everything

1341
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,000
you only use it for for the situations

1342
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,119
where

1343
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,599
you really really need a firm and

1344
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,960
unwavering no uh most things in life and

1345
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,800
in work are negotiable

1346
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,160
so save this one for your your big guns

1347
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,920
um

1348
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,839
and i realized that you know i i said

1349
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,400
that it is okay to curse at work um

1350
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,000
you've definitely heard me curse plenty

1351
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,240
of times in this presentation

1352
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,280
um

1353
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,559
the one thing that i will say about

1354
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,280
cursing at work is know your audience

1355
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,680
it's probably fine to curse on an

1356
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,520
incident bridge or in team internal

1357
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,200
meetings again as long as you're not

1358
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,399
cursing at your peers

1359
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,200
i would recommend against cursing in

1360
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,119
front of your executive team

1361
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,520
or your board of directors um and i

1362
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,520
would really recommend against cursing

1363
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,280
in front of any customers that you may

1364
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,440
have

1365
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,240
um uh and then right here uh we've got a

1366
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,720
mixed green salad with uh slices of

1367
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,359
fresh persimmon and pomegranate seeds

1368
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,280

1369
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,280

1371

1376
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,040

1383
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,680

1388
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,599
vegetables in a way that maybe doesn't

1389
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,920
even feel like vegetables entirely you

1390

1391
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,960
there are no rules

1392
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,319
um

1393
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,440
the one

1394
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,880
on this slide is made with mixed

1395
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,680
mushrooms it was awesome

1396
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,720
in the center here we've got a vegan

1397
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,880
carrot ginger soup

1398
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,960
that i made with purple carrots instead

1399
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,200
of orange ones just for fun

1400
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,359
um went ahead and used a little coconut

1401
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:50,960
milk in there to thicken it up and give

1402
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,160
it a little extra viscosity

1403
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,440
and then over

1404
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,319
on the

1405
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,640
other side there we've got a another

1406
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,960
salad with half an avocado in it because

1407
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,960
getting those fats and proteins in in

1408
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,559

1412
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,280
tagine which

1413
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,319
