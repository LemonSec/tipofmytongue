1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
speaker is dave weinstein and he's going

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,080
to talk about what to look for in a

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,879
manager as well as pottery so this

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,720
should be a fascinating talk just a

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,880
reminder also we have two tracks running

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,480
there's another track running in track

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,880
two as well so check out our schedule

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,520
dave away to you thank you

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,600
thank you all right if i did this right

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,920
i am muted if not someone will tell me

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,800
something

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,760
uh so this is a talk on two subjects

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,199
what to look for in a manager and

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,439
pottery these are subjects that i am

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,199
both very enthusiastic about and i'm

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,880
knowledgeable in one of them which is a

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,719
solid c for those of you who are keeping

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,320
score

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,800
all right um let's see i started my

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,559
career in tech at the end of february in

21
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,520
1988 so just shy of 34 years for those

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,039
of you watching live and in the slack

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,200
channel please don't tell me your age or

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,039
worse lack thereof in the early part of

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,160
1988 it will just make me feel sad

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,120
um i've worked across the industry and

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,960
companies as small as three and in

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,559
companies with you know over a hundred

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,399
thousand full-time employees and that's

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,920
before you get to the contingent staff

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,119
they add on

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,080
i've been an ic i've been a manager i've

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,640
worked in mainframes or i like to call

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,479
them cloud 1.0

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,000
um

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
phones handheld games console games

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,960
uh library automation academic research

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,720
i started my career in military research

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,640
i've seen a lot over the time that i've

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,680
been there and as part of this i was

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,439
first a manager in

42
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,240
uh the early part of this century and a

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,439
lot of the examples i'm going to give

44
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,520
later on things to avoid in a manager

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,159
are are red flags i was flying

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,240
i didn't really want to be managing it

47
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,479
was something i sort of had to do

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,640
i wasn't very good at it i wasn't

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,200
committed to becoming better at it and

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,799
when it was done i swore that i was

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,720
never going to do that again

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,920
and since i decided i was never going to

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,079
be a manager again i wanted to figure

54
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,320
out what it was i was looking for in a

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,600
manager

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,560
and

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,759
that actually turned out to come in

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,439
handy later when i decided that maybe

59
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,520
one bad experience half a career ago

60
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,479
wasn't necessarily just positive

61
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,959
so the problem is

62
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,038
trust me big companies care a lot about

63
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,319
numbers and one of the numbers they care

64
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,760
about is what's called regretted

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,560
attrition which is a nice way of saying

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,920
people who left that we would have

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,680
rather had to stay

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,360
and one thing that those studies show is

69
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
that more than half the time that

70
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
someone leaves a role or leaves a

71
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,280
company it's because of bad interactions

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,080
with their immediate manager

73
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,440
beyond that the tone your manager sets

74
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,080
is going to have a huge impact on your

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,400
quality of life as an employee but to

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,239
the degree that there's any training in

77
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,319
tech at all and there isn't very much of

78
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,560
it it's aimed at trying to get managers

79
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,640
to be less terrible at being managers

80
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,360
so the goal of this first part of the

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,599
talk is how can you identify a good and

82
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,160
a bad manager and with the goal here

83
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,599
being that you want to work for the

84
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,840
former and not for the latter

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,200
so the first question is well how do i

86
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,120
even identify information about my

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,519
manager and there's sort of three

88
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,840
possible ways there are references does

89
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,599
someone you know and trust have they

90
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,040
worked with this person have they worked

91
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,280
for this person especially will they

92
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,640
vouch for them

93
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,400
uh have they worked for this person more

94
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,440
than once

95
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,280
would they follow this person to another

96
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,599
job

97
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,760
um you can do observation if you're

98
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
looking at an internal transfer inside

99
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,200
of a company how does this manager

100
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,720
interact with their team how do they

101
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
interact with other teams is there sort

102
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,480
of anything you can glean about them

103
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,840
through that

104
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,280
and finally you get the interview

105
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,239
process

106
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,080
uh can you get information about the

107
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,760
manager during the interview that would

108
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,920
give you info if you're interviewing for

109
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,360
a role you're probably going to be

110
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
interviewing with people who are on the

111
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,440
same team

112
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,879
uh or the team that you're looking at

113
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,879
joining is there any way you can sort of

114
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,599
glean any information from them about

115
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,920
what their manager is like without being

116
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,799
really blunt and over

117
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,120
does any of this sound familiar

118
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,599
it should because these are the same

119
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,360
problems that companies are trying to

120
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,439
address in the interview process

121
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,120
we all know that interviews are not

122
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,200
ideal you've got people trying to put on

123
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
an idealized form of themselves

124
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,879
companies trying to put on an idealized

125
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,639
form of themselves and we're all trying

126
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,399
to discern information in the space of a

127
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,720
few hours on one day

128
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,800
so companies look at social media you

129
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,720
should look at social media companies

130
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,800
look for references you should look for

131
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,560
references

132
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,400
yeah you're making a very important

133
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,240
decision on minimal information because

134
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,919
that's unfortunately how employment

135
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,759
works it's one of the reasons that you

136
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,199
might be more inclined to follow a

137
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,600
manager you've worked with before

138
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
or that someone you know and like will

139
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,440
vouch for

140
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
the final thing is when it comes to the

141
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,800
interview the fact is that the odds are

142
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
a hiring manager has done a lot more of

143
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,639
these than you do because it's a large

144
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,000
part of their job and they're going to

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,240
be better at pulling information and if

146
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,320
you've interviewed any time in the past

147
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,080
couple of decades you've probably run

148
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,960
into what's called behavioral questions

149
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,880
can you tell me a time when this

150
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,919
happened or can you give an example when

151
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,440
and part of the reason that people go

152
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,039
for that is you're trying to draw out

153
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,479
something that really happened that's

154
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,479
more complicated that you can dive into

155
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,840
and get more info

156
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,000
it also puts the interviewee in a little

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,759
bit more firm ground because it's not a

158
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,039
hypothetical it's something they've

159
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,280
already done

160
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,080
now

161
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,759
whenever you ask a question you are

162
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,680
giving away information so if your idea

163
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
of a really cool question to ask the

164
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,919
manager is can you tell me a time when

165
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,520
you had an employee who spent all their

166
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,360
time posting on reddit and watching

167
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,440
videos on youtube and how you caught

168
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,639
them and what they could have done to

169
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,680
delay that probably not the question you

170
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,560
want to ask if you actually want the job

171
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,800
on the other hand an excellent question

172
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,680
to ask right now is can you tell me the

173
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
changes you made and how you helped your

174
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,080
team adapt and survive over the last two

175
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,680
years of the pandemic

176
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,039
that's going to give you a lot of

177
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,360
information about the manager's style

178
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
about how they work with their team

179
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,440
about what steps they're willing to take

180
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,639
it gives you

181
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,400
more room to probe and ask more

182
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,960
questions and frankly it's a question

183
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,479
you should be asking at this point

184
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,080
anyway so it's not going to set off any

185
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,359
red flags on their part

186
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,919
what follows a red flag to look at in

187
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,960
prospective managers

188
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,600
so for those who don't know the pictures

189
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,360
of jose mourinho

190
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
jose mourinho has been an incredibly

191
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,479
successful football manager in the top

192
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,840
tier of the world

193
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,800
i

194
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,120
could not say anything to quibble with

195
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,520
his successes historically he's got the

196
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,479
silverware to back it up

197
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,560
that being said if i had the skill level

198
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,919
to play in those leagues which i

199
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,319
manifestly don't and if i were not

200
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,479
someone who started their career in 1988

201
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,039
which i manifestly am i still would be

202
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,039
very reluctant to work for him

203
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,520
and the reason is this quote from last

204
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,560
year he was asked why after having um

205
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,840
conceded

206
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,080
points from a winning position that his

207
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,319
team seemed to be losing from winning

208
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,759
positions or conceding to ties from

209
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,680
winning positions when historically that

210
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,520
hadn't been an issue for him and his

211
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,840
answer to an interview was same coach

212
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,919
different players

213
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,080
more recently this week he also made

214
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,520
some disparaging comments about his

215
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,080
current team

216
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,080
don't work for someone whose answer to

217
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,000
things is to throw their team publicly

218
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,240
under the bus

219
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,599
at the end of the day a lot of this

220
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,000
stops with the manager

221
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,599
more importantly

222
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,919
you really want to avoid someone where

223
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,759
all successes are due to managerial

224
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,599
leadership and all failures are due to

225
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,520
the ineptness of the team this is a

226
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,400
giant red flag i would avoid these sorts

227
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,840
of people and i should show that as a

228
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,520
caveat that all of these tips are based

229
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,280
on my biases and my experiences

230
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,160
so this is one where we're gonna look at

231
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,240
advice commonly given to managers and

232
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,319
the advice given to managers is you

233
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,479
praise in public and you criticize in

234
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,759
private

235
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,319
um constructive feedback it should be

236
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,319
noted that the business speak euphemism

237
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,680
for telling someone what they did wrong

238
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,000
is called constructive feedback which

239
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,160
implies that praise is unconstructive

240
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,680
which i don't particularly agree with

241
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,919
but leave it be for now

242
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,240
um you want to work for people who are

243
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,199
going to

244
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,440
trumpet your successes to the world and

245
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
give you your private feedback about

246
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,000
where you need to improve

247
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,560
there is an important caveat here there

248
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,400
are some behaviors in the workplace that

249
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,560
will require immediate and public

250
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,840
criticism

251
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,640
most of those are also experience

252
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,320
actions or interactions that should be

253
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,159
reported to hr and a manager may be

254
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,519
legally required to report to hr but in

255
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,760
general you want to work for people who

256
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,519
are proud to trumpet your successes and

257
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
will coach and work with you in private

258
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,640
to improve your weaknesses

259
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,160
all right it's not a bad sign if your

260
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,440
manager

261
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,160
wants to be an ic in the future

262
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,920
there are plenty of people in this

263
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
industry who have oscillated very

264
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,200
successfully back and forth between

265
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,880
managerial and individual contributor

266
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,040
roles

267
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
it is a bad sign if your manager does

268
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,120
not want to be a manager right now

269
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,560
and whether that's because someone had

270
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
to do it or they were most senior or it

271
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,480
was perceived to be the next step up on

272
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,640
the career ladder anyway these are all

273
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,160
red flags and

274
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,000
as mentioned earlier i have demonstrated

275
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,240
this one myself in the past

276
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,120
um

277
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,760
your manager needs to be as committed to

278
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,160
growing and improving as a manager as

279
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,920
they were to growing and improving their

280
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
technical skills as an ic

281
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,440
and again it's perfectly reasonable for

282
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,279
them to go back and forth but if you're

283
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,720
looking at someone who clearly does not

284
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,120
want to be leading a team right now you

285
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,480
clearly don't want to be working for

286
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,640
them

287
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,640
like trust respect is earned and i'm not

288
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
talking about you know respect someone

289
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,440
uh you know their rights their their you

290
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,680
know personhood respect them as a person

291
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,080
i'm talking about respect for them

292
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
in a professional sense

293
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,240
is earned so is trust for managers out

294
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,160
there people aren't going to trust you

295
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,519
especially when they've been burned in

296
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,640
the past until you earn

297
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,680
now this is best done through stories

298
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,279
and i'm going to go with one that is

299
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,120
second hand because if you want me to

300
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,279
tell my personal experiences with this

301
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,040
we're going to be not streaming live

302
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,959
over the internet and probably in a bar

303
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,600
when it's safe to meet people again

304
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
in the 90s i was living in virginia

305
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
working in the game industry and the

306
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,800
local paper was the washington post and

307
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,120
they had a you know sort of a

308
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,880
federal employment column

309
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,399
and in the run-up to yqk

310
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,240
they've been hiring a lot of people from

311
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
outside the traditional

312
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,880
you know federal government roles

313
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,640
and there was a lengthy column

314
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,040
explaining to fed managers

315
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,120
that the a lot of the people they were

316
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,360
hiring for this were used to reaching

317
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,800
out to their professional and peer

318
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,959
colleagues for feedback and guidance on

319
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,120
technical issues and that this should

320
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,760
not be taken as a

321
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,800
threat or disavowal or

322
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,040
basically flagrant opposition to the

323
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,920
manager's authority

324
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,680
and i stopped because that would never

325
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,360
have crossed my mind

326
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
i realized that a i didn't ever want to

327
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,440
work in an environment where that had to

328
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,760
be said and i didn't even realize that

329
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,079
was a thing

330
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,640
so if there's a manager where all

331
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,560
communications with other teams need to

332
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
be guided through them

333
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,279
where all decisions every decision has

334
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,040
to go through the manager

335
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,680
that's a red flag it's some combination

336
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,800
of micromanagement and paranoia and you

337
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,839
probably want to avoid it

338
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,000
come on clicker we're moving forward

339
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,079
fine we'll do it that way

340
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,320
um

341
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,839
as a manager

342
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,079
the behavior you walk by is the behavior

343
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,320
you endorse

344
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
hard rule

345
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
if you are interviewing for a role or

346
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,240
you are observing a team and their team

347
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,279
culture looks toxic to you

348
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,279
for your own sake assume the manager

349
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,360
condones an approved summit

350
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,680
that may not be true they may not be

351
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,839
aware of it which is a different problem

352
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,040
and you would probably want to avoid

353
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,600
that manager anyway they may be actively

354
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
trying to stop it but the odds are they

355
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,639
aren't

356
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,279
and for your own sake you should avoid

357
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,279
those environments so if the team

358
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,040
culture in the interview process or an

359
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,720
observation looks toxic avoid the

360
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,120
manager

361
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,200
so one of the questions that comes up a

362
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,560
lot is should your should you expect

363
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,000
your manager to be better at your job

364
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,279
than you

365
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,839
so the short answer to that is no

366
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,399
the sort of the medium length answer is

367
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,279
maybe if you're entry level

368
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,760
the longer answer is still no

369
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,440
but there may be some exceptions

370
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,200
especially when you're either being

371
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,320
hired in to fill a role that was held by

372
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,800
the manager say as a tl before they had

373
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,200
too many responsibilities to do it or is

374
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,760
in their personal area of expertise

375
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
that being said i've had some great

376
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,399
conversations with with peers and very

377
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,399
senior managers

378
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,399
who are hiring for teams that are in

379
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,959
their areas of expertise and will note

380
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,639
that

381
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,480
they are trying to fill job wrecks that

382
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,920
they themselves never would have

383
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,680
qualified for because that's what

384
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,360
they're looking for right now

385
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,200
as you grow in seniority in your career

386
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,399
you're going to be brought in as a

387
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,240
specialist and a subject matter expert

388
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,839
and know your manager is probably not

389
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,399
better than you are if you are outside

390
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,480
of one of the core uh sort of

391
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,199
disciplines if you are being hired in as

392
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,560
a business analyst to a team that

393
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,079
doesn't have one the odds are very good

394
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,320
your manager doesn't have that expertise

395
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,399
same thing for ux same thing potentially

396
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,000
for security if you are the security

397
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
person being brought into a team that

398
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,920
hasn't had one odds are your manager is

399
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,959
not a domain expert in that area

400
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,800
which brings up a question that was

401
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,399
asked to me by one of my people at one

402
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,839
point which was

403
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,800
what actually do you do anyway um which

404
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,680
fair

405
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,519
um managers have a set of objectives

406
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,880
that they need to meet

407
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,120
and they have a set of

408
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,279
people to meet it with those people are

409
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,360
not fungible they have their own skills

410
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,720
they have their own experiences they

411
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,320
have their own interests professional

412
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,279
interests inclinations and goals

413
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,360
as a manager if you can line up a

414
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,959
business need with something that also

415
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,560
fits someone's personal and professional

416
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,480
needs and lines them up for a promotion

417
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,120
that is a very very good day

418
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,399
at the end of the day though there's

419
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,519
always going to be work which is

420
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,279
operational or toil based that needs to

421
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,360
get done you need to make sure that that

422
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,600
is not unfairly lumped on one person you

423
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
need to make sure it is distributed you

424
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,120
need to make sure that you are giving

425
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,360
people the opportunity for growth even

426
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
if it isn't the optimal path for getting

427
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,959
something done as fast as possible

428
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,720
great

429
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,199
that's all well and good i know somewhat

430
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,120
what not to look for what should i

431
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,160
actually look for in a manager

432
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,839
so i'm going to flip manager advice

433
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,639
again

434
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,040
i was asking when i was looking at going

435
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
back into management and being a tech

436
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,199
lead and manager i asked several people

437
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,519
i knew who i worked with who were tlms

438
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,320
on on peer teams and who i respected

439
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,519
whether they thought it would be a good

440
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,639
idea

441
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,720
and one of the best pieces of advice i

442
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,800
got was to ask myself

443
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,040
if someone on your team delivers a

444
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,120
really impactful technically difficult

445
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,440
really cool piece of technology that is

446
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
in your field of expertise and you could

447
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,759
have done given the time to do it are

448
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,360
you going to be excited that you made

449
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,440
that opportunity possible and take joy

450
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,800
in their success or are you going to be

451
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,959
bitter and angry that they got to do the

452
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,239
cool thing while you got to do paperwork

453
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,040
look for the manager who's going to be

454
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
excited and proud that they were able to

455
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,079
in whatever way help enable your success

456
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,839
avoid the managers who will take credit

457
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,720
for your work but be happy for the ones

458
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,480
look for the managers who will be happy

459
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,560
for it and proud of their aspect in

460
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,518
making it possible

461
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,759
there's a quote many of you have

462
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,160
probably heard it i was unable to find a

463
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,360
source for it

464
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,639
um

465
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,240
two people talking and one says well

466
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,759
what if we invest in all this expensive

467
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,079
training for our people and they leave

468
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,920
the other says yeah what if we don't and

469
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,839
they stay

470
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,079
even at companies that have tech budgets

471
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,759
for training and theoretically are

472
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,600
invested in training and conferences and

473
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,920
the like there can be wide differences

474
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,240
in how much that matters from team to

475
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,680
team

476
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,079
there's a lot of ability for money for

477
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,079
money and priorities to move around

478
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,560
you want to find a manager who is

479
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,199
absolutely on board with investing in

480
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,199
growth of the team

481
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,639
at all costs

482
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,639
um they're the people who are going to

483
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,560
get you the better skills even though

484
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,839
that means you might move to another

485
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,440
team or even another role because it's

486
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,240
the right thing to do

487
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
not only is that good for your personal

488
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,639
career growth those monitors also tend

489
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,320
to attract the sorts of people you want

490
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,920
to be working with anyway

491
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,440
this gives a little bit away of whatever

492
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,919
future slides but i was reflecting uh

493
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,520
over the managers i respected over the

494
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,400
years

495
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
and what they had in common and i

496
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
realized that all of them had one

497
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,000
fundamental

498
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,959
thing in common and that was they all

499
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,039
cared more about the people working for

500
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,400
them as people than anything else

501
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,640
i have had managers say if you're not

502
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,319
looking for work right now because of

503
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,599
our situation

504
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,039
you are crazy

505
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,679
i have a manager say you should take the

506
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,840
job because what i can offer you to stay

507
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,320
is an insult

508
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,880
i have seen managers make decisions this

509
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,200
is an executive make decisions

510
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
for a company

511
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,600
that costs the company money overall

512
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,440
because the alternative would have been

513
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,360
hurting a couple of the employees

514
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,840
financially very significantly

515
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,679
for those outside the u.s this is yes

516
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,000
this is a corporate healthcare decision

517
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,840
these are all examples of managers i

518
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,320
have had and respect greatly

519
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,080
and that's something you should look for

520
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,240
look for a manager who cares more about

521
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,280
you the person than you the employee and

522
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,880
who is going to support you in doing

523
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,280
what you need to do

524
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,039
even if it means that they have a hole

525
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,480
in their table of organization that they

526
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,720
need to fill even if you are very hard

527
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,600
to replace you want people to know you

528
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,960
want a manager who is going to care

529
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,200
about you before the job

530
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
and that's a great chance for you to

531
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,039
also excel as an individual

532
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,880
the original outline for this talk had a

533
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,799
bunch more slides but i realized they

534
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,600
all came down to this and this is where

535
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,520
i have to call out my biases there are a

536
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,600
number of different styles of management

537
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,120
the one that i prefer to work for and

538
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,600
try and exhibit uh it was was called

539
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,640
servant leadership by robert greenleaf

540
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,320
yes the manager has a role in helping

541
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,559
set direction yes the manager has a role

542
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,080
in making sure everyone's moving in the

543
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,880
same way same direction however

544
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,559
fundamentally

545
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,720
i prefer to look for managers who see

546
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,440
their role as support to take obstacles

547
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,039
out of the way of the team

548
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,600
and to support the team as needed

549
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,520
sometimes this is the manager as

550
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,120
ablative armor

551
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,799
keeping from rolling down on the

552
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,240
team

553
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,280
um

554
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,000
but at the end of the day the managers i

555
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,400
look for are the ones who are focused

556
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,679
less on

557
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,840
what they can do

558
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,080
directly and more on what they can do to

559
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,000
enable the team to deliver what needs to

560
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,080
be delivered because really honestly

561
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,440
that's the biggest role i think a

562
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,080
manager has

563
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,960
so as an exercise

564
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,480
think of the managers you have most

565
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,400
respected and what characteristics

566
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,360
inspired that respect

567
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,200
now try and figure out how you would try

568
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,960
and identify that in a prospective

569
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,559
manager because that's something that

570
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,640
will serve you

571
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,240
very well more importantly it's

572
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,840
something that's specific to you because

573
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,600
what you look for in a manager may not

574
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,039
be what i look for in a manager

575
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,200
all right for those people who are uh

576
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,120
looking at these slides and not looking

577
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,600
at the video i apologize everything else

578
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,639
is going to be live video

579
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,120
so we're going to go

580
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,679
off of the screen share

581
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,000
pottery

582
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,720
a couple disclaimers first i am not a

583
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,799
skilled potter i'm an enthusiastic

584
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,120
potter i enjoy it but what i really am

585
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,280
is someone with a tech job which means i

586
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,440
can buy toys

587
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,080
uh second disclaimer there is a lot of

588
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,320
room for intellectual exercise in

589
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,440
pottery

590
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,520
what makes up a clay how the clay bodies

591
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,280
are done how that will interact in the

592
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,520
kiln what makes up blazes what effects

593
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,600
you can get uh shrink rates and

594
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,880
everything else

595
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,039
i choose to interact with exactly zero

596
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,280
of that i buy the clay bodies already

597
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,760
mixed i buy the glazes already mixed and

598
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,600
i use kiln firing programs that an

599
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,960
expert has already figured out how to

600
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,400
make work

601
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,480
and the reason for that is i have enough

602
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,760
other things in my life that are

603
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,919
intellectual and i don't need another

604
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,080
one i need something that is more in the

605
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,960
physical domain that is more

606
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,520
sensory that at least gets me out of my

607
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,440
head and lets me stop thinking for a bit

608
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,480
so

609
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,240
i personally like to make functional

610
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,039
wear mostly it's t-wear um of varying

611
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,520
qualities so as an example uh this is a

612
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,960
gaiwan

613
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,679
um it's a lidded cup for making tea so

614
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,600
you put the t in you have a large amount

615
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,960
of tea relative the amount of water you

616
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,120
put it in you mix it very briefly you

617
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,200
tilt and you dump

618
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,640
and there you pour the tea

619
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,520
this is a manifestly terrible guy want

620
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,679
it is badly thrown

621
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,919
uh it is badly trimmed

622
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,080
uh it is badly glazed badly fired and

623
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,240
the lid is just awful

624
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,200
makes a good example

625
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,840
this guy wand is much more recent

626
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,120
it is got much better throwing

627
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,000
it has got much better glazing

628
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,480
the lid actually fits

629
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,440
although in fairness i don't make a lid

630
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,600
to fit a bowl i make a bunch of bowls

631
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,120
and i make a bunch of lids and i see

632
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,320
what matches

633
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,559
um there are people who can sit down

634
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,400
with something in mind to make and just

635
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,559
make it i am none of those people there

636
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,080
are still lots of things i would improve

637
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,919
on this but it's definitely something

638
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,919
i'm reasonably proud of

639
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,880
this is fully fired play it's stoneware

640
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,520
um the intermediate step this may or may

641
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,360
not turn into a french onion soup pot i

642
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,039
say may not because the bottom is very

643
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:31,919
thin

644
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,080
uh this has been best it's been fired

645
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,200
once

646
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,360
uh at this point you cannot turn it back

647
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,720
into play

648
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,559
uh you can turn it into something to

649
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,200
fill a hole in your driveway

650
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,840
um the next step is to glaze it and then

651
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,679
fire it again at the higher temperature

652
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,159
it will vitrify it gets more solid the

653
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,400
glaze uh is glass

654
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,600
on the outside

655
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,840
um

656
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,559
this is what's called green ware

657
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,400
uh this if you get it wet just turns

658
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,600
back into mud

659
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,000
all right it has been thrown it has been

660
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,799
trimmed it is ready to be missed it is

661
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,799
as bone dry as you can get in the

662
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,280
pacific northwest uh specifically it is

663
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,520
no longer capable of

664
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,679
uh having moisture evaporate from it in

665
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,760
the ambient environment uh the next step

666
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,640
for it is in a kiln

667
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,440
now one thing to realize with pottery is

668
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,600
that things can go wrong an incredible

669
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,120
number of ways which may well get

670
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,559
demonstrated in the

671
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,720
rest of the demo

672
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,240
problem the first

673
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,480
uh you can prepare the clay poorly so

674
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,720
that you have air pockets

675
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,880
you can

676
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,360
build or hand build the clay badly

677
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,279
uh or throw the clay badly so it's a bad

678
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,279
pot

679
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,880
you can trim it badly whether that is

680
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,720
simply uneven or you actually put a hole

681
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,520
in it

682
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,400
and we'll be doing a trimming

683
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,480
demonstration in a little bit

684
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,000
it has to survive the firing without the

685
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,080
initial firing without cracking you have

686
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,760
to glaze it

687
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,919
successfully it has to survive the gray

688
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,640
the glaze firing successfully without

689
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,320
cracking or demonstrating a glaze that

690
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,760
you really don't like without pitting

691
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,679
without bubbling

692
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,120
and then you have to not drop it

693
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,760
there are an enormous number of ways for

694
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,720
failure

695
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,360
in the process of this the good news is

696
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,960
if you're interested in infosec from

697
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
either the offensive or defensive side

698
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
you've already accepted the risk of all

699
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,320
the different ways things can go wrong

700
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,720
for you

701
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,240
now there are a bunch of different

702
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,400
approaches to pottery i mean at the very

703
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,000
minimal stage you take a lump of clay

704
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,679
you put it in your hand you

705
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,120
press the sides together and make a

706
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
little pinch cup

707
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,000
and you put it in a fire and you have a

708
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,039
cup

709
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,880
uh there is hand building which can be

710
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,960
done either sculpturally or it can be

711
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,559
done rolling it into slabs

712
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,919
making it into coils and then blending

713
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,120
those together and there's wheel

714
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,039
throwing for me i prefer wheel throwing

715
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,799
just because it's kind of cool

716
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,919
um

717
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,520
one last thing if you haven't watched it

718
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,880
and you're interested in pottery you'll

719
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,320
probably enjoy the great pottery

720
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,440
throwdown

721
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
it's really interesting they do a lot of

722
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,799
very challenging work you can learn a

723
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,960
lot the only caveat i'll make is that

724
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,720
while the subjects they cover are

725
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,159
fascinating to me

726
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,320
the actual competition itself is sort of

727
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,360
the opposite of what i get out of

728
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,120
ceramics which is a chance to relax and

729
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,640
unwind and trying to build specific

730
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,080
things to a specific brief under a

731
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,640
specific time limit and then be judged

732
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,600
would be really unpleasant

733
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,760
so

734
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,840
now we get to the point of the live demo

735
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,960
alright so hopefully we have now

736
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,640
switched and you can hear me through the

737
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,279
other microphone

738
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,600
so this is a shimpo electric wheel um

739
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,679
there are a lot of exam advantages to

740
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,159
this one for people who've never done

741
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,520
pottery before

742
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,279
um it's a direct drive wheel and it's

743
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,159
very quiet which is great for me but

744
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,600
people who've done pottery for a long

745
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,679
time and are used to belt driven wheels

746
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,840
we'll both expect the time it takes the

747
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,520
belt to wind down rather than instant

748
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,000
response and also will often use the

749
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,760
sound the wheel makes as an input to

750
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,000
what they're doing

751
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
right now if you were interested in

752
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,760
doing this the supply chain as with

753
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,799
everything else is a problem

754
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,799
and you may be limited to what you can

755
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,960
actually find on top of the wheel is a

756
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,799
tool called a giffen grip

757
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,400
so traditionally the way you would trim

758
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,679
is that you would put the item in the

759
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,200
center of the wheel and you would sort

760
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,720
of spin the wheel slowly and tap it

761
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,159
around till it looks centered again and

762
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,440
then you would chuck it into place with

763
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,960
some loose splay

764
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,000
this is really irritating or hear me out

765
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,080
you can just use a tool that does it for

766
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,240
you

767
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,279
so um this particular piece is a little

768
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,880
too heavy on the bottom and of course

769
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,520
obviously the foot is wrong

770
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,960
so all i'm going to do is just take a

771
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,440
sharp tool

772
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,760
i'm holding down on the top because as i

773
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,840
put friction on it

774
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,760
i can pop it off

775
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,600
because i don't want too much pressure

776
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,120
on it

777
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,039
so this clay this particular piece is

778
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,960
what's called leather hard

779
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,679
which basically means you can cut it

780
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,360
without just smushing it all to hell

781
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,960
the other advantage of the gif and grip

782
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,480
is that it's really easy to just pop it

783
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,240
on and off again so here it's a lot more

784
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,080
shaped like a cup um

785
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,559
it's still fairly thick around the edges

786
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,360
uh

787
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,360
there's room to either inset that foot

788
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,919
in and i will should add i am not great

789
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,240
at cutting feet on these things so we're

790
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,520
going to do a live demo and since i'm

791
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,640
not great at it i'm going to do it

792
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,240
anyway

793
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,520
because again

794
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,039
this is a hobby this is something i do

795
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,159
for fun and because i enjoy it

796
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,399
and i am accepting of the fact that

797
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,919
things can go wrong so i'm just going to

798
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,200
blend that out a little bit

799
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,679
take another tool take the little beak

800
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,840
end

801
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,720
if i were smart i would have taken that

802
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,840
tool off before i did it

803
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,440
i'm really smart i would have not had

804
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,960
the sharp tool sitting in the middle of

805
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,480
the giffin grip while i was trying to do

806
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,360
things that was clever

807
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,520
but

808
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,840
and here there's a little bit of an

809
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,799
inset there just a little bit of a rim

810
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,720
that is you know reasonable enough for

811
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,000
what it is this will shrink

812
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
significantly in firing so it's a very

813
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,440
small teacup

814
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
but it's an adequate pickup you can put

815
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,559
it to the side for the moment

816
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,520
uh this particular clay that one had a

817
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,880
relatively small amount of clay at the

818
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,720
bottom this one has a very thick bottom

819
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,679
on it

820
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,679
so there's more room to either trim it

821
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,320
or destroy it

822
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,240
or you know both

823
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,840
um one of the things i like about

824
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
ceramics in general is that it's both

825
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
additive and subtractive

826
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,600
you can address things by adding more

827
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,200
clay to them

828
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,559
uh

829
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,640
the catch is see right there it just

830
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,279
popped up the catch is that you need to

831
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,440
uh

832
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,480
oh also you'll make a mess

833
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,000
the catch is that you need to have the

834
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,679
humidity right between the pieces of

835
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,559
clay you don't want it to shrink

836
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,600
you know what

837
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,039
i need to use a slightly different set

838
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,559
of chucks for this and i don't really

839
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,760
want to spend the time on it right now

840
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,200
so i'm going to put this one aside for

841
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,440
later

842
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,279
because the next part of the demo is

843
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,559
even more fun

844
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,159
for

845
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,000
inspiring the wrath of the demo gods

846
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,679
um because i'm trying something that

847
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,960
should theoretically work but i haven't

848
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,360
tried so when throwing

849
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,960
you can throw directly on the wheel head

850
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,399
that's how i learned

851
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,279
we use a bat system so there are play

852
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,440
discs or play squares that go there you

853
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,120
throw on you pop it out when you're done

854
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,679
i said i'm enthusiastic but not

855
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,600
particularly skilled

856
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,760
so i didn't want to have you watch me

857
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,360
center clay

858
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,760
so yesterday

859
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
i centered some clay and put it aside in

860
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,679
a plastic bucket

861
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,840
i've never tried this in theory this

862
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,440
should work just fine

863
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,720
in theory

864
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,840
everything works in theory

865
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,880
also it's not quite right but

866
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,120
let's see how it feels

867
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,080
yeah it's not centered uh or rather the

868
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,080
wheel slightly off centered and i put it

869
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,039
in which i was kind of afraid of

870
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,279
um

871
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,559
so

872
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,559
it's a piece of clay it is kind of

873
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,240
centered i don't want to spend all of

874
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,919
our time centering it

875
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,760
uh it has been compressed so you raise

876
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,960
it up you push it down you raise it up

877
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,000
you push it down you're trying to get

878
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,240
the clay compressed so that the bottom

879
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,760
doesn't crack if you don't compress it

880
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,000
correctly the bottom cracks and then you

881
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,600
put it back in the bin

882
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,480
so

883
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,679
wow you are not centered

884
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,880
so two options but i'm gonna go with

885
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,240
just get something centered quickly

886
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,919
so

887
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,480
when you're opening the clay up

888
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,000
and i can tell by the feel that it is

889
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,519
definitely not centered unfortunately

890
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,880
but it's a demo and i don't want to

891
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,799
waste all your time watching this

892
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,440
uh so because it's not centered

893
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,880
what's going to end up happening is that

894
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,640
the edges are not going to you can see

895
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,120
the center is wobbling the edges are

896
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,200
going to be irregularly shaped as we go

897
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,919
but what the hell it's a demo

898
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,279
and if you're not afraid to fail you

899
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,399
shouldn't be doing this any if you're

900
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,440
afraid to tell you shouldn't be doing

901
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,960
this anyway because the only way to get

902
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,120
better is to try things that break so

903
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,480
what i'm doing here is i'm opening a

904
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,720
hole in the center of the of the clay

905
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,360
form

906
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,679
this often pulls something off center so

907
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,240
you can see it's not great

908
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,519
it's uh

909
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,880
a bit

910
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,799
slightly irregular there this is a

911
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,960
chamois cloth just to compress the top

912
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,840
down a little bit

913
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,200
and then

914
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,640
we're just going to pull the clay up

915
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,799
now there's a lot of guidance i have

916
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,799
seen so many contradictory things about

917
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,360
how to pull and how to do it and i can

918
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,720
tell by looking at it again we're off

919
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,799
center but

920
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,720
what else uh the great thing about this

921
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,120
is again whatever doesn't work gets cut

922
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,320
off

923
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,559
re-uh

924
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,440
equalized in humidity and then just gets

925
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
uh

926
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,440
blended together and used again

927
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,279
anyway there's a lot of different advice

928
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,960
there's tons of source material out

929
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,679
there

930
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,840
um there has never been a better time in

931
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,519
the history of the human race to be

932
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,519
self-taught at something

933
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,440
so again basically all i'm doing here is

934
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,279
i'm using the wheel itself you can see

935
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,440
that

936
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,559
we're just pulling up the clay comes up

937
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,840
because the force of the wheel is

938
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,799
pushing it out

939
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,760
i'm going to go ahead and take the

940
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,640
the

941
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
sponge to the outside and help smooth it

942
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,559
and also help me set it a little bit now

943
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,399
one thing i'm going to slow this down

944
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,480
uh i can feel here i don't know if you

945
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
can see it that i pulled up irregularly

946
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,279
so

947
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,200
this particular section right there is

948
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,519
actually thinner than it should be

949
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,200
um this makes the this makes the whole

950
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,720
thing slightly unstable so i'm going to

951
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,279
try and just be less put less pressure

952
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,480
with my fingers as i go through that

953
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,480
section

954
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,960
again

955
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
you would take the cloth

956
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,279
or the chamois and you want to squeeze

957
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,640
in there

958
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,360
just to compress the ridge the end

959
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,960
similarly

960
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,880
take a sponge

961
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,640
compress the base

962
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,240
now note that as it's spinning that's

963
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,039
going to push the clay out as you go

964
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,279
so

965
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,880
now at the moment this is a bowl also

966
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,080
theoretically if you're doing what

967
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,679
you're supposed to be doing you throw a

968
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,120
cylinder first

969
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
and then you pull it out to the side

970
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,880
i did mention i'm not that great at this

971
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,279
i just enjoy it so

972
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,200
um because this wheel goes

973
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,960
counterclockwise which is the western

974
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,919
style

975
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,719
um you want to have your inside hand be

976
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,960
your left hand your outside hand your

977
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
right hand and you want to work

978
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,719
basically from this quadrant of the

979
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,480
wheel and you can see that this thing is

980
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,399
definitely off trip

981
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,760
also you can see that i knocked the

982
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,000
sponge away

983
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,280
so

984
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,520
we'll reach down and grab that

985
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,399
um

986
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,560
because this is pretty much a scrap pot

987
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,359
at this point it's not going to work

988
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,760
um i'm gonna just go ahead and

989
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,520
color it in a little bit

990
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,199
just for fun just to show some of the

991
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,399
stuff you can do because again i'm just

992
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,760
putting pressure with my hands as it

993
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,280
goes

994
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,879
and as i slid up on the wheel i'm gonna

995
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,280
try and get it to round out a little bit

996
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,119
but um you can bring that in

997
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,359
wow that's not true you can come around

998
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,119
here take a little bit of the slip off

999
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,480
see one of the other things you can do

1000
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,520
when you start getting to the point

1001
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,480
where while that top is not working

1002
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,720
you can take a separate tool and say huh

1003
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,598
that part's terrible

1004
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,880
cut it off

1005
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,359
try again from down here is this part

1006
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,640
better well a little bit

1007
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,119
while you're putting pressure on it

1008
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,040
there is room to do things like

1009
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,960
shape it

1010
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,760
you can take a hand

1011
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,160
blend it

1012
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,800
push the outside again this piece is not

1013
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,920
going well

1014
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,800
um

1015
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,880
at a given session i can sit down and

1016
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,640
spend a couple hours and i might get a

1017
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,320
couple pieces that i think i'm worth are

1018
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,720
worth firing uh and i'm pretty generous

1019
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,160
on what's worth firing it's like if it's

1020
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,760
vaguely round shaped i'll probably fire

1021
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,560
it

1022
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,920
if nothing else it's practice and

1023
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,720
trimming and glazing

1024
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,320
and here what's happening is you notice

1025
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,200
how i said there was a a thin spot

1026
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,880
that's what keeps folding over when i do

1027
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,000
things so the right answer here

1028
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,359
is literally to come beneath it with

1029
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,000
that pen tool

1030
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,520
cut it off

1031
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,800
now

1032
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,480
we can then take the same tool

1033
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,440
try and trim this outside section off

1034
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,160
where it's off

1035
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,000
and potentially

1036
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,399
cut that away

1037
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,760
this is the amount of clay that's

1038
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,920
already been cut off

1039
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,280
there's a reason it starts with a bigger

1040
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,040
level

1041
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,480
now the good news is at this point

1042
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,400
this starts looking like something that

1043
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,880
maybe could turn into a lid it started

1044
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,040
as a bowl it might be a lid it might be

1045
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,800
a saucer it might all end up in the

1046
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,560
recycler

1047
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,960
if your goal here is that you are always

1048
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,599
going to be successful it's a bad hobby

1049
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,000
to take up

1050
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,839
because even if you get to the point

1051
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:08,960
where there is stuff that you can

1052
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,520
reliably always deliver

1053
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,839
if that's all you do you never grow you

1054
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,520
never learn anything new

1055
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,560
uh

1056
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,720
i had a teacher who said basically

1057
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,880
the first the first point that becomes

1058
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,119
interesting is when you start going

1059
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,720
backwards

1060
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,359
because you are basically if you're not

1061
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,640
going backwards you're not pushing

1062
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,000
yourself

1063
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,599
keep learning new things keep trying new

1064
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,240
things at the end of the day it's just

1065
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,480
fancy mud since i can't see the computer

1066
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,520
how are we doing on time

1067
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,240
yeah you have about

1068
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,160
six more minutes or so

1069
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,560
i can take questions i can also while

1070
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,920
we're doing that

1071
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,280
pop this off for the moment it's

1072
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,800
you could maybe make something out of it

1073
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,400
but it doesn't really look like it's

1074
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,000
gonna be worth it right now

1075
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,610
we'll put that aside because

1076
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,880
[Music]

1077
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,040
but demo prep means having

1078
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,359
another display ready

1079
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,599
this is the other reason i like this

1080
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,599
particular system

1081
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,839
all right

1082
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,680
so are there any questions

1083
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,119
a lot of people are asking about the

1084
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,800
firing process they want to know how

1085
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,480
much space it takes up what you've got

1086
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,960
in your house how you doing

1087
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,079
i have a fairly oversized kiln for what

1088
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,599
we do it's uh seven cubic foot cone art

1089
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,760
um you can get smaller kilns i would

1090
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,400
recommend buying a good sized kiln

1091
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,320
because you don't want to buy more than

1092
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,079
one

1093
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:46,960
uh

1094
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,119
kilns generally need 18 inches of

1095
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,280
clearance from flammable objects because

1096
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,320
i am paranoid and working security i've

1097
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,280
got 24 inches to anything flammable the

1098
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
bricks around you can see sort of over

1099
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,200
here is actually a brick web on the wall

1100
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,680
so this is one third thickness brick uh

1101
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
both because i like the way it looks and

1102
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,640
because it gave a non-flammable surface

1103
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,920
around the kiln

1104
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,760
even though the floor in this studio is

1105
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,560
concrete the kiln itself is actually on

1106
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,040
raised

1107
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,800
mortared down pavers

1108
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
so that there is a seven foot by seven

1109
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,640
foot clear demarcation of nothing

1110
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,280
flammable goes here please

1111
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,200
this is a lot of paranoia because the

1112
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,119
controller will actually shut down if

1113
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,880
the temperature at it goes above about

1114
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,599
180 or 190.

1115
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,480
um i also have there's a

1116
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,880
vent out of the bottom of the kiln

1117
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,440
which goes to the outside to remove

1118
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,200
volatiles from the kiln

1119
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,880
and the style i use of the

1120
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,800
recommendation of my local shop which is

1121
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,599
clay art center in tacoma is the fan

1122
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,680
actually mounts to the wall not to the

1123
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,240
kiln so that if you do get a pinhole

1124
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
anywhere in the pipe that's going to it

1125
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,240
it'll still keep pulling air out of the

1126
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,400
building rather than venting it in

1127
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,960
i also have a secondary fan which will

1128
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,400
move about 1400 cubic feet per minute

1129
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,319
that we run when the kiln is running

1130
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,480
mostly to keep the room from overheating

1131
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,040
and i have an allied fireball mounted

1132
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,680
above the kiln as uh active fire

1133
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,040
suppression

1134
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,800
i might be a little paranoid on some

1135
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,839
things um

1136
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,920
it's an electric kiln in washington

1137
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,079
state that is a fantastic idea because

1138
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,319
electricity is cheap out here

1139
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,680
uh it's got a programmable controller um

1140
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,000
so there's sort of two basic types of

1141
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,800
firing for pottery there's uh oxygenated

1142
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,280
firing and reduction firing

1143
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,160
so all electric kilns are oxygen firings

1144
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,520
because you're not actually burning

1145
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,200
anything so there's free oxygen in the

1146
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,599
air in the kiln

1147
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,000
a reduction firing is something using a

1148
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,880
fuel

1149
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,000
or it can be where there is no oxygen

1150
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,400
available for the glazes to grab so

1151
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,839
they'll pull things out of the clay

1152
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,000
itself the two styles can give very

1153
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,440
different results

1154
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,599
uh beyond that there are for example

1155
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,440
wood firings which take a prolonged

1156
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,440
period of time usually you get people

1157
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,560
working together to do them because

1158
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,480
you've got to stoke the keep the wood

1159
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,880
going for for ordered days

1160
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,280
and the way those work is that the wood

1161
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
ash is what you're looking for the ash

1162
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,240
actually as it deposits on the clay

1163
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,319
forms a glaze all its own so you get an

1164
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,000
unpredictable glaze

1165
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,680
and you don't have a lot of control over

1166
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,200
it

1167
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,440
for most people an electric kiln is what

1168
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,880
you're going to want also an electric

1169
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,720
kiln is usually about the only thing you

1170
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,640
can buy

1171
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,720
most people when they're doing clay uh

1172
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,400
fuel fired whether it's gas-fired

1173
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,000
oil-fired wood fired build the kiln

1174
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,200
themselves

1175
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,680
um electric is a lot easier to work with

1176
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,079
again it's a basically it's a metal box

1177
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,280
with uh

1178
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,920
clay and it draws a fair amount of power

1179
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,000
you will for any reasonable size kill

1180
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,880
you will need an electrician uh my kiln

1181
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,599
is on a 240 volt single phase

1182
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,599
and it draws up to 80 amps at uh

1183
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,119
at inrush current

1184
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,040
um

1185
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,880
so you are going to need to get it wired

1186
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,160
in

1187
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,440
um

1188
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,319
i

1189
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,599
would want to make sure you want to be

1190
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,119
sure that you have the heat sources

1191
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,160
controlled you don't have anything

1192
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,118
flammable near it

1193
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,440
also right now because of supply chain

1194
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,040
you don't have a lot of flexibility in

1195
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,599
what kills you can get timelines can be

1196
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,640
six to 12 months out um talk to local

1197
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,240
suppliers you might be able to find one

1198
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,440
used

1199
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,200
uh you would want to get someone who

1200
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,480
knows what they're doing to tell you

1201
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,079
whether it's a good kiln to buy or not

1202
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,160
and how much maintenance it needs

1203
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,240
in theory there's a lot of maintenance

1204
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,319
you can do yourself you can

1205
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,079
you know the heating elements eventually

1206
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,839
burn out need to get replaced sensors

1207
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,560
may burn out need to get replaced

1208
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,440
um

1209
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
clay brick is very fragile the fire

1210
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,520
brick is very fragile so my plan for

1211
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,880
this is when i need to replace the

1212
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,319
elements i'm gonna hire a professional

1213
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,599
to do it for

1214
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,160
uh this also gets back to the

1215
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,000
tech pace for hobbies way more than

1216
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,760
hobbies pay for tech like this is

1217
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,680
literally the least cost effective way

1218
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,760
to get ceramics you can think of

1219
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,160
i could buy any pot i wanted except

1220
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,839
maybe a ming boss or something for the

1221
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,240
rest of my life and not break even with

1222
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,839
what i spent getting the studio set up

1223
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,599
awesome thank you so much that was a

1224
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,680
wonderful explanation

1225
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,839
um i don't see any other questions does

1226
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:27,920
anybody else have any questions for dave

1227
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,160
since i'm relaying them since uh dave's

1228
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,319
hands are currently yeah

1229
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,040
normally you would you battery trim

1230
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,040
after throwing but it's like i need to

1231
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,640
do the throwing last because at that

1232
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,480
point i need to wash my hands before i

1233
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,680
can get uh

1234
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,240
the computer

1235
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,800
i think that's it

1236
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,960
dave thank you so much for doing this

1237
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,040
thank you i will once once everything

1238
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,640
gets cleaned up i will be in the uh

1239
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,440
i'll be in this plaque um

1240
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,680
again uh one thing i mentioned in the

1241
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,760
abstract i didn't really talk to early

1242
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,560
in your career there's a huge return on

1243
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,400
investment of like spending spare time

1244
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,000
growing your technical skills

1245
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,400
it really is i'm not gonna lie

1246
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,119
however that does not stay

1247
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,119
once you've really got a good handle on

1248
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,359
ramping up on new technologies

1249
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,520
um you need to do something that isn't

1250
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,040
or most people need to do something that

1251
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,200
isn't just tech that's why you see a lot

1252
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,359
of people take up woodturning or take up

1253
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,680
pottery or take up anything

1254
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,839
that exercises a different part and lets

1255
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,280
you relax

1256
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,720
um

1257
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,520
totally agree very important i mean

1258
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,520
obviously i agree i set up this

1259
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
conference about it but yeah

1260
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,359
but it's a very very important point a

1261
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,839
lot of fun and for me again

1262
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,400
it's relaxing also

1263
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,000
we've talked i know there have been the

1264
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,520
keynote talked about setting up places

1265
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,119
for people to fail i've talked about

1266
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,480
being willing to fail in public has

1267
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,000
witnessed these demos

1268
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,720
um it's nice having something where your

1269
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,760
failure

1270
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,680
doesn't matter

1271
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,240
if you screw up it's just mud it goes

1272
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,200
back you use it again

1273
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,640
that's awesome

1274
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,880
thank you so much

1275
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,880
okay thank you
