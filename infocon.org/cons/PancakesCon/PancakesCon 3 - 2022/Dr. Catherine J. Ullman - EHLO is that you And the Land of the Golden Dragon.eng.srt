i selected this talk we'll get into this

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,480
in a moment but essentially it's a topic

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,719
near and dear to my heart it was one of

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,880
the very first things security related

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,680
that i learned before i really got me

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,840
deep into this field

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,000
so for those of you who are not familiar

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,600

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,160

chit

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,360
because apparently it was one letter too

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,120
long for the twitterverse

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,600
so here we go this is a little bit about

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,399

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,119
there and the wall of sheep which is

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,479
part of defcon

45
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,479
i volunteer at a whole bunch of places

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,360
i've done a bunch of talking and i love

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,680
sloths anybody who knows me knows i

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,280
absolutely love sloths and this is a

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,079
picture of my sloth flash

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,720
who is at the buffalo zoo

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,680
where uh he hangs out with his trainers

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,439
and um

53
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,479
i adopt him once once a year i get i pay

54
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,719
a fee and that helps to feed him so that

55
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,040
is flash

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,720
had to include this because uh at least

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,879
some of you will get

58
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,280
uh just to be silly

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,640
all right so here's what we're gonna

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,560
cover there are two topics as with all

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,720
pancakes con talks

62
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,160
the first one is this hello is that you

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,040
and we'll talk what about what uh the

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,599
ehlo really is

65
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,599
we'll talk a little bit about email

66
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,000
because to really understand why you're

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,480
looking at email and determining whether

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,040
or not it's legitimate or not legitimate

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,800
requires that you understand a little

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,680
bit about how email works and it really

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
hasn't changed appreciably in many many

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,640
years

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,400
then we're going to distinguish between

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
what's called the envelope and the

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,120
header

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,879
these are terms that get thrown out a

77
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,360
lot but they don't necessarily mean what

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,440
we think they mean so we're going to

79
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,680
talk about those two things

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,760
we'll also talk a little bit about how

81
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,959
the client something like outlook or

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,280
thunderbird communicate with a server

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,800
sending email

84
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,480
then we'll go over reading an actual

85
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,239
email header and we'll talk about what

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,400
the different lines in the header

87
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,720
can tell us about whether or not that

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,000
message is legitimate so

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,080
and of course to understand that we have

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,239
to be able to find those headers right

91
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,840
because well as we'll learn in the

92
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,959
beginning

93
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,920
headers are not readily apparent when

94
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,000
you get an email you typically don't

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,080
just see the headers so we'll talk

96
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,760
briefly about that

97
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,720
well there are some ideas some concepts

98
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,400
spf dkim and dmarc which we'll cover but

99
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,480
i'm going to be very brief on those we

100
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,159
could get into a lot of detail but i

101
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,840
just want you to be familiar at least

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,080
with those terms because if you're doing

103
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
anything with email these days they do

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
pop up and we'll talk a little bit about

105
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,519
some useful tools that you can

106
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,120
use to help you

107
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,439
decipher some of these headers when it

108
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,280
gets a little overwhelming

109
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
and then the second half of my talk is

110
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,120
going to be about something called the

111
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,680
society for creative anachronism

112
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,640
where

113
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,200
i live in the land of the golden dragon

114
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
and so to understand all of that we'll

115
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,160
talk a little bit about what the sca is

116
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,798
and its history and how we're set up the

117
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,199
kinds of cool things that you can do if

118
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,160
you join us to have some fun how we're

119
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,040
organized we'll talk ultimately about

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,680
not only getting involved in the sort of

121
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,520
day-to-day or regular experiences but

122
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,240
something called the panzik war which is

123
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,479
this giant event with lots and lots of

124
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,160
people that happens pretty much every

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,240
summer barring of course

126
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,960
a

127
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,000
nasty

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
um

129
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,520
covid experience right

130
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,120
and then we'll talk a little bit about

131
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,560
personas and and get into all of that so

132
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,000
here we go

133
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,039
so the first part talking about email

134
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,080
the thing to understand about email is

135
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,400
that email was

136
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,880
meant originally just for basic

137
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,680
communications when it first started the

138
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,320
first email was sent in 1965 it was in

139
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,199
uh one single machine so a person would

140
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,840
sit down and they'd send the message and

141
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,440
that message would sit and wait for the

142
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,160
next user of that same machine and it

143
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,080
was not meant to go anywhere outside

144
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,280
that machine

145
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,360
so if you think about that it's very

146
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,680
specific right you know exactly who's

147
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,800
coming in you know who's going to

148
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,039
potentially see that message it doesn't

149
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,240
go anywhere so the way email

150
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,600
is built

151
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,720
we'll see

152
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,960
it's not built with any sort of security

153
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,560
in mind

154
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,360
the first real email where it actually

155
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,199
goes somewhere

156
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,840
it goes to something called arpanet

157
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,759
if you're not familiar with arpanet

158
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,680
arpanet is

159
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,759
essentially the beginnings of what we

160
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,840
now think of as the internet it was a

161
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,039
connection

162
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,000
between a bunch of well originally four

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,199
machines

164
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,639
that were all

165
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,680
university machines and that was how the

166
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,680
first email was sent outside of that

167
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,960
single machine

168
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,039
it's sent from one machine to another

169
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,440
within this very tiny network and the

170
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,360
image that i have here

171
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
actually shows you

172
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
what arpanet looked like when it first

173
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,360
started if you look carefully and i know

174
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,199
the image is tiny but in 1969 you only

175
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,880
have these four nodes and those are the

176
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,039
only places that can send to each other

177
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,759
by 1970 there's a few more

178
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,400
by 72 there are even more

179
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,759
schools involved in arpanet and by 1977

180
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,919
it's really started to explode so these

181
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,080
are really the beginnings of the

182
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,639
internet which we see email being

183
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,880
transmitted through and

184
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,680
really the idea again this isn't

185
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,440
how we think of email today right we

186
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,919
think of email or at least i think most

187
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,960
people think of email as this worldwide

188
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,120
thing i can send an email to anybody in

189
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
the world who has email

190
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,240
but at the time this was just internal

191
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,639
communications among the entities that

192
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,360
were on arpanet

193
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,479
fast forward a whole lot and we get the

194
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,520
current rfc or what's called a request

195
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,319
for comment

196
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:26,080
5321. now the original

197
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
request for comment which is all the

198
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,319
details and all of the information about

199
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,960
how email works and all the technical

200
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,680
details of how a message is sent

201
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,479
that is in a different rfc

202
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,800
the one i mentioned here

203
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,919
is the current one and it superseded all

204
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,240
the ones before this so that's why i'm

205
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,919
mentioning this one but if you look up

206
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,360
rfc 32 5321

207
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,039
you'll actually see that there are

208
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,199
others that have come before it and the

209
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,280
original one that set this out so if you

210
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,599
want to understand how email works in

211
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,319
its gory details you can look into this

212
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,400
but i wanted to keep this pretty high

213
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,080
level because i know some of you this is

214
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,440
very new

215
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,759
there have been some additions since

216
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,479
2008 which is when this was last updated

217
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,720
um and those rfs

218
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,440
those editions that

219
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,080
7504

220
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,879
in

221
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,400
2015 cover things like encryption and

222
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,240
the things that did not originate with

223
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,039
email so that's kind of the beginnings

224
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,319
now

225
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,280
let's talk a little bit about

226
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,200
mass in email

227
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,519
just as a quick refresher or for anybody

228
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,958
who's not sure

229
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,039
the whole idea behind dns is that humans

230
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,440
really suck at numbers but we're really

231
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,399
good with names so dns is domain

232
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,800
namespace and it does a translation

233
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
between

234
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,839
the number and the name

235
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,160
so the thing is if i'm going to send an

236
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,279
email

237
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,200
i have to know

238
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
where to send that and how to get more

239
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,640
information about that

240
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,800
so the first thing that happens is we

241
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,360
have to know what host name is going to

242
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,399
provide more domain information and that

243
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,480
domain information like say buffalo.edu

244
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,720
which is where i work

245
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,959
has something called an mx record and an

246
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,360
a record and the a record is essentially

247
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,200
what tells you the core information

248
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,720
about the domain

249
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,399
but the mx record is what tells you

250
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640
about mail servers it's about mail

251
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
exchangers so that's kind of important

252
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,120
because i need to know if i'm sending a

253
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,160
message

254
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,240
for the

255
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,680
buffalo.edu domain

256
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,320
what is the information about those mail

257
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,600
servers

258
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,080
so then we can see that

259
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,160
those servers are the ones that should

260
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,320
accept smtp email and smtp is the

261
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,920
protocol for sending messages right so

262
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,160
we need to know in what order to send

263
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,959
them and what host name so if let's say

264
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,680
we have 16 different mail servers and we

265
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
do have a number of them i couldn't tell

266
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,920
you quite how many but there is an order

267
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,560
in which that message is supposed to be

268
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,360
sent so that is what that mx record

269
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,959
provides it says here's where you send

270
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,880
that mail here's the order in which you

271
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,920
send it

272
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,360
and then of course the a record

273
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,920
specifically tells you what ip is

274
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,320
associated with the particular host so

275
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,519
hopefully that's clear

276
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,399
now

277
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,839
once we know

278
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,880
where it's going right and we know some

279
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,320
stuff about the domain and the mail

280
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,920
servers itself

281
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,120
here's how mail actually gets routed

282
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,399
so

283
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,399
you send mail to

284
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,000
user at in my case buffalo.edu

285
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,959
it does that ns record it looks for

286
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,880
what example.com or in my case

287
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,320
buffalo.edu would be and it says give me

288
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,200
all of those mx records so tell me where

289
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,680
i can send this what what is the address

290
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,600
for these mail servers

291
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,000
and first it finds

292
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,240
the a record so that it knows what i p

293
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,600
addresses are

294
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,880
or the mx record if it doesn't find an

295
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,480
mx record if it doesn't have a

296
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,040
particular record for a mail server but

297
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,279
it has that a record that says this is

298
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,560
the domain

299
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
it will sit it will just send that

300
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,000
message straight to the ip

301
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and those little fiddly details aren't

302
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,079
necessarily really important for what

303
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,600
we're going to be doing but i wanted to

304
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
just cover kind of the background and

305
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,800
we'll see why in a minute i hope

306
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,360
okay so i mentioned

307
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,880
mtp

308
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,399
smtp

309
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,560
is the protocol for sending email there

310
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,800
has there are a couple of versions of it

311
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,519
now there's something called esmtp

312
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,760
and for our purposes these work more or

313
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,880
less the same but one of the differences

314
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,480
is that

315
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,440
the original smtp

316
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,040
we'll see in a moment there's a

317
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,120
conversation that goes on between the

318
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,800
client and the server

319
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,440
and the client first sends a message to

320
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,720
the server that's h-e-l-o it's literally

321
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,320
a conversation

322
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
with e-s-m-t-p

323
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,639
we see e-h-l-o

324
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,519
so

325
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,279
that's probably the biggest difference

326
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,279
in where the title of my talk actually

327
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,000
comes from so let's talk a little bit

328
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,360
about the envelope versus the header

329
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,800
it's intuitive if you've sent mail

330
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,079
versus

331
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,360
sorry mail

332
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,120
in the traditional

333
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,880
postal service you know you get an

334
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,240
envelope and you put a piece of paper in

335
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,839
it you send it to somebody

336
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,519
it's tempting to think of the envelope

337
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,519
as the thing on the outside that you can

338
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,480
see but the reality is the envelope is

339
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,600
what is created when the exchange

340
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,160
happens between the client

341
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,040
so again outlook thunderbird and the

342
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,399
server something like exchange or

343
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,519
um you know any any mail server

344
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,200
that that is out there so

345
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,839
what you don't see

346
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,399
is the envelope unless you happen to be

347
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,320
watching that conversation

348
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,519
so it's part of that message creation

349
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,839
when smtp goes to actually send the

350
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,000
message it throws this away it just

351
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,519
needs it initially

352
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,399
because it has this mail from

353
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,360
and re receipt to so your sender and

354
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,959
your recipient

355
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,959
and it's going to use that information

356
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,959
to route the message and it's going to

357
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,839
do that routing via dns like we just saw

358
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,120
a moment ago but as i said we don't see

359
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,000
that

360
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
so the only way we knew we would know

361
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,399
this is happening is if we're sniffing

362
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,279
the

363
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,160
packets and we see this conversation

364
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,279
now because of this it's very easy to

365
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,240
forge because the end user who said gets

366
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,440
this message

367
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,360
they never see this

368
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,760
so they don't realize that

369
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,680
who the from

370
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,720
the mail from or the receipt to that can

371
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,519
be changed on the fly as the message is

372
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,199
being sent and this will make way more

373
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,600
sense when i get to the next slide

374
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,480
the headers on the other hand

375
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,639
they are in the message

376
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,839
but usually your user won't see them you

377
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,040
have to

378
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,639
usually change something in the message

379
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,560
go into an option setting we'll see this

380
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,120
in a minute um and that's what allows

381
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,279
you to see these headers so these are

382
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,560
written line by line as every as a

383
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,720
message goes from one server to another

384
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,880
because when mail is sent it doesn't

385
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,440
literally go from server a to server b

386
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,600
there's usually a couple of servers in

387
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,680
between that are helping it get from

388
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,519
point a to point b and we'll see that in

389
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,360
the headers that i show you

390
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,480
and again

391
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,959
it's not immediately visible

392
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,519
you can forge headers it's just a little

393
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,880
trickier

394
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,480
you need to have the right

395
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,079
setup to do that

396
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,000
all right

397
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,480
so what does this all lead to

398
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,720
well if you get the question as i

399
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,800
frequently did when i first started in

400
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,160
this field is this message legitimate

401
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,639
sometimes people think when they receive

402
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,760
a message

403
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,959
that the from field is without a doubt

404
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,199
accurate that's not an unreasonable

405
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,880
thing if you're not a technical person

406
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,000
right

407
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,519
however

408
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,880
the reality is that from field

409
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,320
can be set to be

410
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,399
to come from anyone

411
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,680
anywhere

412
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,199
let's see how that works all right

413
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,920
so here's this dialog that we're talking

414
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,680
about right

415
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,880
so

416
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,279
the this the green side there that's

417
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,800
your client

418
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,440
and the blue side is your server

419
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,279
so the client says

420
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,160
in this case h-e-l-o

421
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,759
and asking for that domain and this mail

422
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,320
server at the domain says i can process

423
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,240
that message

424
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,720
so then the client starts that process

425
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,680
and says i'm going to send mail

426
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,480
it's coming from this address now you'll

427
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,680
notice

428
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,120
there's nothing here to prevent somebody

429
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,279
from literally putting anything they

430
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,680
want in that mail from field

431
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,279
there's nothing by default in email

432
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,959
that

433
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,600
does any kind of authentication

434
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,560
or you know determines this is really

435
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,560
coming from in this case bill gmail.com

436
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,160
and this is what a lot of people don't

437
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,880
understand so when they get a message

438
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,279
and we'll see ultimately the from that

439
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,800
they're seeing

440
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,320
isn't actually

441
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,639
the from here it's in the data we'll get

442
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,399
there in a minute

443
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,839
they assume

444
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,240
these things are all legitimate all

445
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,160
right so we have these first two lines

446
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,920
this is the envelope remember we talked

447
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,199
about the fact

448
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,199
that this is

449
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,920
the message who it is from and who it is

450
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,399
to this is part of that conversation

451
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,800
this is not the message itself

452
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,120
this is the envelope

453
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,639
when we get to

454
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,399
the section where it says here's the

455
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,079
whole message that data section

456
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,959
that is the message and that will

457
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,000
typically have a from and a two and a

458
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,319
subject and a date field

459
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,119
and that is what your user sees when

460
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,679
they open a message

461
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,520
consider for a moment

462
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,760
if i send the message so it looks like

463
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,880
it's coming

464
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
from

465
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,039
bill gmail.com

466
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,840
and in that data portion

467
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,400
it says from bill gmail.com

468
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,520
it may

469
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,160
look as if it legitimately came from

470
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,440
bill gmail.com but we know

471
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,240
that the information can be changed

472
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
to be anything you want it to be it's

473
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,280
it's not

474
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
simple in the sense that you have to

475
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,960
have a mail server you can send all of

476
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,400
these things through but it is

477
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,160
absolutely doable

478
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,520
all right

479
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,799
because

480
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,039
all this is taking place in this

481
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,480
conversation

482
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,880
and there's no security mechanism by

483
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,480
default in place

484
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,160
that means when i get to the data

485
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,400
portion i can put anything i want and

486
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,679
that's what your end user is going to

487
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,120
see

488
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,919
so once this conversation ends

489
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,440
then it terminates so i got all that i'm

490
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,120
finished now goodbye

491
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,280
so hopefully that makes sense that this

492
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,120
is the conversation between those two

493
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,679
entities

494
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,720
so i'm giving you a real example

495
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,400
this an email message

496
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,880
that we received at the university

497
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,000
from somebody asking is this legitimate

498
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,160
and if you spend a moment here and you

499
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,600
read through it

500
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,640
it appears as if it is a job

501
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,799
uh opportunity for a student

502
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,679
now what's interesting is that the reply

503
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,240
to address if you look carefully is not

504
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,400
a buffalo edu address

505
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,280
so

506
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,960
that's a little weird

507
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,919
and

508
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,240
sometimes in the client we see a reply

509
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,400
to sometimes we don't

510
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
sometimes clients will cut off other

511
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,919
pieces just depends on how they're

512
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,200
configured

513
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,600
but what is confusing about this if you

514
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,480
were to go to my university

515
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,880
and you looked up somebody named ryan

516
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,080
austin

517
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,400
you would see this individual does in

518
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,480
fact work at the university

519
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,320
and is a research analyst so you might

520
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,760
think oh this is completely legitimate

521
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,679
but

522
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,760
let's look at the headers now

523
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,600
for any of you seeing this for the first

524
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,640
time

525
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,320
i guarantee

526
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,200
that

527
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,880
there are other folks out there if

528
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,919
you're feeling overwhelmed that's okay

529
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,000
this is an overwhelming bit of

530
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,240
information if you've never seen it

531
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,880
if you have seen it before

532
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,559
your eye should immediately go to the

533
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,559
bottom of the screen

534
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,080
why is that

535
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,120
well we read email headers from bottom

536
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,159
to top

537
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,240
not top to bottom

538
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,159
and that is partly what can be very

539
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,400
confusing about this

540
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,480
so we see at the very bottom

541
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,880
we see our from and our two and our

542
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
subject and the date

543
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,200
all of that is the stuff we saw

544
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,679
here right this is exactly what we saw

545
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,720
from

546
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,360
subject date to

547
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,760
now in this header

548
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,520
to protect the innocent and at the

549
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,360
request of my employer

550
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,799
you will not see

551
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,480
real email addresses you will see

552
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,039
recipient and you will see

553
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,080
sender

554
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,880
and again i've done that at the request

555
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,760
of my employer but um but i've left the

556
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
rest of this alone so you can actually

557
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,240
see exactly what's happened here

558
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,640
so for reading from bottom to top

559
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,080
we start with the received from

560
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,000
the very first received from is what

561
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,320
you're always looking for

562
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,960
and that's highlighted here so we can

563
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,200
see received from

564
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,200
160.116.189.12

565
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,240
that is the system that sent this

566
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,600
message

567
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,840
and we see it was sent via port 51

568
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
and it said hello

569
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,520
to

570
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,159
with with this string

571
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,240
it was received

572
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,720
by

573
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,600
bonneville.website welcome

574
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,240
that should be a huge red flag

575
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,520
because

576
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
i don't work at website welcome

577
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,600
i work for the university of buffalo

578
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,280
again if we go back quickly and we look

579
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,840
at this message it's supposedly from

580
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,080
somebody at the university at buffalo

581
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,320
coming back here

582
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,960
we read this again bottom to top so if

583
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,240
we follow the next few lines we see that

584
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,080
the next jump remember i said that email

585
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,000
messages go from server to server to

586
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,039
server

587
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,240
we see that it was received from that

588
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,720
bonneville site by something called

589
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,320
cmsmtp that's presumably a machine

590
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,039
and then we look at the next line that

591
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,240
machine

592
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,919
is really probably this

593
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,919
cm11.websitewelcome.com

594
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,400
and that gets received by their gateway

595
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,280
hopefully you're following this

596
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,240
now the next bit once we get up to where

597
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,799
our systems at the university accept it

598
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,840
this is where it gets a little

599
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,559
complicated and it's complicated because

600
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,120
you have to understand how our email

601
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,159
system works and that is that we accept

602
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,280
email

603
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,440
that ultimately goes to gmail for our

604
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,480
students so that's why you're going to

605
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,440
see gmail involved in this in a minute

606
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,360
so if we if we go up to line 35

607
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,480
we see

608
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,280
that the message is received from this

609
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,039
from the gateway website welcomes

610
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,880
gateway

611
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,039
and um

612
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,600
by our mail server so

613
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,240
mx2.mail.buffalo.edu which is a relay

614
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,880
and it is going to pass it up to google

615
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,840
now

616
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,640
we have a bunch of lines above that

617
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,280
which ultimately walk us through

618
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,880
checking to see

619
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,799
whether this message is legitimate or

620
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,480
not and we'll talk a little bit about

621
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,840
this when i get to the slides about

622
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,200
about spf records and then ultimately

623
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,280
the message gets sent to google

624
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,840
but what's and and google in fact is

625
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,760
where our student mail is and if you

626
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,120
look at the very top you will see the

627
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,000
messages delivered to recipient at g

628
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,320
dash mail.buffalo.edu

629
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,919
which is

630
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,760
which would be if it had the real name a

631
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,000
legitimate address

632
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,960
okay

633
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,000
so hopefully that makes sense

634
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,919
so how do we know

635
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,039
that this message did not actually come

636
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,320
from this ryan austin person

637
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
again there are a bunch of things we can

638
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,919
look for

639
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,720
we saw the header it's appended to each

640
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,400
at each mail exchange point so each

641
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,919
server where it gets passed along from

642
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,360
bottom to top

643
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,080
so remember i like sloths

644
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,039
so

645
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,120
reading from bottom up you're gonna read

646
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,679
it the way a sloth would from bottom to

647
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,880
top

648
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,480
you're gonna look for that first

649
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,679
received from so in some cases that

650
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,600
requires scrolling all the way down

651
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,840
because there's a lot of stuff there

652
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,880
and then we're going to look for

653
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,480
inconsistencies

654
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,039
remember we saw that weird reply to

655
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,440
and we saw that that

656
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,559
message

657
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,279
uh we saw even that that weird reply to

658
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,480
wasn't university we saw the website

659
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,480
welcome piece which has nothing to do

660
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,600
with us

661
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,480
um

662
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,159
university at buffalo

663
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,400
if there had been uh maybe this was a

664
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,840
phishing message you want to look for

665
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,039
urls or is the url in

666
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,520
the actual message

667
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,200
related to whatever it's supposed to be

668
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,039
from so if it's coming from somebody at

669
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,480
the university of buffalo and they're

670
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,320
supposed to be sending you a link to get

671
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,760
a job

672
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,919
well you know it really should have some

673
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,919
reference to the university of buffalo

674
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,520
although of course

675
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,320
i will give the caveat right that in all

676
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,760
cases

677
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,480
all bets could be off depending on how

678
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,400
things are structured

679
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,600
so it is very possible that an entity

680
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,400
uses a third party for doing job hiring

681
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,279
and maybe it wouldn't have

682
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:41,279
buffalo.edu in that url

683
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,600
so you know remember that when you're

684
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,039
looking at this all of these can

685
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,279
potentially be red flags but you have to

686
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,279
do your homework you need to understand

687
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,679
what each of these lines tell you

688
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,400
about the male movement and tell you as

689
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,240
far as consistency with what you would

690
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,279
expect

691
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,120
and one of the ways that you can learn

692
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,919
this

693
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,840
is simply by having somebody that you

694
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,080
know in your organizations send you a

695
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,760
message and look at the headers to see

696
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,679
what normal looks like

697
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,679
we'll get to that in a minute

698
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,480
so some other things to keep in mind

699
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,760
clients sometimes try to be very helpful

700
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,720
and so they will reorder the information

701
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,480
that is in your header

702
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,480
so um being helpful means that they

703
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,360
screw up where that receive that first

704
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,760
received from is so you need to double

705
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,679
check and make sure that that first

706
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,240
received from really is the first one

707
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,400
i can tell you this seems like a lot

708
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,159
after you do it a bunch of times your

709
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,000
eye will be immediately drawn to that

710
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,240
first received from and it will get

711
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,279
easier

712
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,960
but you want to make sure you check for

713
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,360
time zone offset so

714
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,080
if we go back

715
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,600
quickly wrong direction if we go back

716
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,200
quickly we can see

717
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,000
um if we look at for example line 38 we

718
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,960
have cst so that offset is six and if we

719
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,840
look at line 36 so 38 and 36 have

720
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,440
different offsets they're different time

721
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,640
zones

722
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,919
so that's what i'm talking about there

723
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,880
all right

724
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,360
so don't forget about the human element

725
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,279
if you're trying to determine is this

726
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,919
message legitimate and you know who it's

727
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,440
supposed to be from

728
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,960
you can always pick up the phone and

729
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,760
call

730
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,880
you can always check with an

731
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,399
organization even if you don't know the

732
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,760
individual

733
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,559
even in the job that i have

734
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,159
because we have departments that

735
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,080
sometimes send messages through these

736
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,399
third-party services and they do it

737
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,039
legitimately but i'm not aware the fact

738
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,120
that that's what they do

739
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,080
i might call the department and say hey

740
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,279
do you use mailchimp do you use one of

741
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,600
these third parties you know would it be

742
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,320
something that i should expect to see

743
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,919
because you may not know for that

744
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,279
organization

745
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,520
so never you know

746
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,360
feel like you can't pick up a phone and

747
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
just ask and especially if this is

748
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,000
coming from something like a bank or you

749
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,559
know an organization that's selling you

750
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,760
something that could be critical

751
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,000
all right so finding and setting the

752
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,520
headers

753
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,480
i provided information for three very

754
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,559
common things

755
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,440
used as clients so gmail

756
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,279
outlook for windows and outlook on the

757
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,360
web or the outlook web app

758
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
i'm only providing these as examples

759
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,840
there are a gazillion different

760
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,600
clients that can be used i mentioned

761
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,000
thunderbird before

762
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,919
you know there's lots of others and

763
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,399
every version of every one of these

764
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,840
applications

765
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,600
has their own magic for finding the

766
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,559
headers

767
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,919
so if

768
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,240
one of these things is not what you're

769
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,200
using or even if you are using one of

770
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,440
these things and these directions don't

771
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,240
look familiar it may just be the version

772
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,480
that you're using is a little different

773
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,200
so

774
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,600
you know googling is your friend here

775
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,399
and that may be what you have to do

776
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,279
um

777
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,919
one easy way to get headers from

778
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,919
somebody who's not technical

779
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,080
is if you can get them to create a new

780
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,360
message

781
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,559
and take the new the message in question

782
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,480
and literally just click and drag it

783
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,880
into that new message and send it to you

784
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,360
you usually get the headers that way so

785
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,320
you know pro tip that's one easy way

786
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,559
sometimes to get non-technical people to

787
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,559
help give you those headers

788
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,840
um but this can be very challenging

789
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,919
so you know google is your friend here

790
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,000
so the these are the

791
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,679
mail concepts that i said i would

792
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,679
mention at the end spf dkim and dmarc

793
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,679
are additions to email

794
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,039
because

795
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,480
people are

796
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,720
spoofing email all the time right i mean

797
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,679
i wouldn't be having this talk with you

798
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,440
if that weren't an issue if people

799
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,080
didn't ask me is this legitimate is this

800
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,679
real job offer

801
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,840
is this a real invoice um you know one

802
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,320
example that uh

803
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,640
my father used to run into all the time

804
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,360
and he ran the computing center at the

805
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,960
college where i grew up

806
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,440
somebody would receive a message

807
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,679
supposedly from somebody in the same

808
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,279
organization

809
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,960
and they would be

810
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,520
terribly upset because the what was in

811
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,200
the message wasn't very nice and they

812
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,799
would say how could you send me this

813
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,640
horrible message

814
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,039
and again it was just spoofing right the

815
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,520
message is made to look like it came

816
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,440
from that person because as we saw

817
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
there's nothing to prevent you

818
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
from putting something in the body the

819
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,000
from message as from somebody else

820
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,799
or even putting that from in the header

821
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,600
i'm sorry in the in that conversation in

822
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,000
the beginning and also in the header but

823
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,440
again that's a little more challenging

824
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,799
to change

825
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,760
um

826
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
so it will look like it comes from

827
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,520
somebody and they may

828
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,679
not realize it i i've certainly run into

829
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,840
cases where i have users who think

830
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,440
they've gotten a message from their own

831
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,480
account

832
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,240
only to find out it was a case of

833
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,640
spoofing so all of these things are

834
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,039
actually meant to help prevent that sort

835
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,240
of thing

836
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,200
so spf is going to validate the message

837
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,640
came from

838
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,600
an approved sender so so an ip that or

839
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,919
for your domain you know has your

840
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,360
organization

841
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,760
blessed if you will you know these ips

842
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,320
to send on behalf of your domain

843
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,919
um dkim uses a digital signature adds it

844
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,600
to the header did this really come from

845
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,679
where you think it did and dmarc uses

846
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,279
both of these things

847
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,120
but they're all meant to help with

848
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,799
spoofing and again i don't want to spend

849
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,320
a lot of time here because these are

850
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,279
somewhat complicated but i will tell you

851
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,679
not all organizations use them some of

852
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,559
them set up for example spf records um

853
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,399
but they don't use them to actually

854
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,679
prevent messages from being sent uh they

855
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,720
just notate them the header uh that

856
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,200
there is spf information there

857
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,519
so if you're interested in these topics

858
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,360
please by all means

859
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,679
go ahead and take a peek at them

860
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,360
here are a handful of tools that can be

861
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,279
very useful if you're if you're looking

862
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,200
at a header and you're confused the mx

863
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
toolbox can be great at helping break

864
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,480
down that header

865
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,039
if you had a

866
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,440
if you've ultimately had a message that

867
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,960
has gone through a client where it's

868
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,559
done some tweaking and put things in a

869
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,080
different order it can be even more

870
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,440
confusing this may not help

871
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,000
domain dossier is a great site that can

872
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,760
tell you about particular ips and

873
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,799
domains

874
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,679
so

875
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,279
if you're using a service like

876
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,399
you know microsoft exchange online or

877
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,720
gmail or something and you don't know

878
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
about a particular ip you can look that

879
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,519
up

880
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,840
if you have encoded stuff you can look

881
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
that look at that in cyber chef and you

882
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,519
can actually decode it

883
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,679
and then there's another tool called

884
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,080
message header analysis which is similar

885
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,840
to the feature in mxtoolbox

886
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,039
and

887
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,200
if you're like me and you get to the

888
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
point where as much as you love

889
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,880
technology you want to get completely

890
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,159
away from it

891
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,120
one place that i can go is the land of

892
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,158
the golden dragon

893
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,200
so

894
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,480
the land of the golden dragon is the

895
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,399
part of the society for creative

896
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,399
anachronism the sca

897
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,159
it is a worldwide living history group

898
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,039
where all ages learn about history we

899
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,399
recreate the arts and skills of pre-17th

900
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,240
century europe so i've got some pictures

901
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,000
of folks

902
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,360
doing fighting and fencing um you can

903
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,760
see we we have children involved the

904
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,519
picture in the center at the top there

905
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,039
is myself and my husband that was

906
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,840
actually one of the first years

907
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,320
that we were together that's how we met

908
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,720
was through the sca

909
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
so here's a little bit about the

910
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,039
background of the society

911
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,039
it was founded in 1966 it was

912
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,679
essentially a party

913
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,720
a problemost reenactment group in the

914
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,760
world

915
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,480
we are we consider the known world which

916
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,320
is basically all the chapters that are

917
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,679
all over the world

918
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,599
uh and those chapters are called

919
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,918
kingdoms and there's 20 of them

920
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,320
and those can be further subdivided into

921
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,719
local groups as you can see canton

922
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,639
shires baronese there's even other

923
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,480
groups that are smaller

924
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,320
and this is what it looks like with all

925
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,239
the different logos for the different

926
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,359
kingdoms

927
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,000
and we will see momentarily that where i

928
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,839
live is in the kingdom of ethel mark

929
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,280
so

930
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,079
the kingdom of ethel mark is on the left

931
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,560
within the kingdom of ethel mark i live

932
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,719
in the barony of the rhydric hale which

933
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,839
is also known as the land of the golden

934
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,480
dragon as you can see the dragon is part

935
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,639
of the arms that we can see

936
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,839
on the right there so um we will see

937
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,960
momentarily this is the kingdom

938
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,240
this

939
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,560
comprises in the real world central and

940
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,560
western new york and pennsylvania and

941
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,680
all of west virginia so each kingdom

942
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,960
subdivides

943
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,599
the actual uh you know like the united

944
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,119
states or or europe into these smaller

945
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,760
spaces

946
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,839
so what do we do in the sca well pretty

947
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,560
much anything that happened in

948
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,839
that time period pre-17th century europe

949
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,960
somebody researches and recreates

950
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,880
and yes i get the question all the time

951
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,320
what about the plague

952
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,160
well i'll tell you the plague is

953
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,680
something that i spend a bunch of time

954
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,079
researching too now we don't try to

955
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,880
recreate the plague that would go badly

956
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
but you literally can do just about

957
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,920
anything this is such a tiny subset of

958
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,320
all the things that we have to do

959
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,160
in the sca

960
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,520
it's amazing and pretty much any kind of

961
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,200
hobby that you have today there's

962
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,079
probably something some equivalent

963
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,560
that's related if you like knitting we

964
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,960
had fiber arts and that was you know the

965
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,880
history of some of this stuff

966
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,960
so it's pretty cool

967
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,040
this is how we're organized

968
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,000
we have royalty and the royalty are

969
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,040
chosen by a heavy martial combat so we

970
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,400
have what's called

971
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,960
crown tournament every six months

972
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,000
and who wins that tournament

973
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,760
they get to be the royalty

974
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,079
so uh traditionally it's been a king and

975
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,680
queen but we have had in the recent past

976
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,720
we have had uh

977
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,440
couples that were that were in the

978
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,599
tournament that were

979
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,119
uh not necessarily king and queen but uh

980
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,599
king and king or except that's not the

981
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,079
verbiage that we're using in in those

982
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,320
cases it's it's the

983
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,640
the king or queen and their consort and

984
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,960
we do make adjustments for

985
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,800
folks who are trans and you know however

986
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,560
they want to be known

987
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,200
we make accommodations for that um

988
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,119
beyond the royalty we have what are

989
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,960
called landed nobility

990
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,560
and those are chosen by the populist

991
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,640
vote so this is for the the smaller

992
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,520
groups so at the next level down

993
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,359
so for example the barony of the hit

994
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,200
richard hale where i live we have a

995
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
baron and baroness

996
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,160
and

997
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
they swear fealty to the royalty but

998
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,240
it's like any other club right the baron

999
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,520
and baroness

1000
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
essentially are the folks who are giving

1001
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,599
out awards the local level the king and

1002
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,520
queen they give out some awards at that

1003
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,040
level

1004
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,040
and they represent the kingdom

1005
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,000
in its larger interests but we do have

1006
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,079
operational officers so these are more

1007
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,839
like your traditional

1008
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,720
uh folks that run an organization so we

1009
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,400
have a president they're known as the

1010
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,599
seneschal

1011
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,079
we have an ex checker that's what we

1012
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,599
call our treasurer

1013
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,040
and then we also have these are the

1014
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,960
other things that are required we have

1015
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,920
to have an ans minister so somebody who

1016
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,520
oversees the arts and sciences so some

1017
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,800
of the things that we saw on the

1018
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,839
previous slide like

1019
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,560
um uh like the fiber arts or or clothing

1020
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,960
or any of those kinds of things we have

1021
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,400
what's called a night martial and a

1022
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,320
marshall in our setting is really just a

1023
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,520
referee

1024
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,359
but the knight in fencing marshals

1025
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,760
oversee they're they're responsible for

1026
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,520
the folks who are uh playing those games

1027
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,760
if you will so so fighting or fencing

1028
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,320
and if you want to get involved

1029
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,240
again we have chapters all over the

1030
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,560
world odds are pretty good wherever you

1031
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,400
are we are too

1032
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,240
there are typically local practices

1033
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
they're either free there may be a small

1034
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,240
donation requested it's usually to cover

1035
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,400
the site so where we have fencing and

1036
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,680
fight practice

1037
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,839
that does cost us money so we ask for a

1038
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,839
donation to cover that

1039
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,520
but where we have thrown weapons

1040
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,760
practice that's someone's backyard so

1041
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,920
because that's someone's backyard

1042
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,640
you know unless they have a need uh for

1043
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,839
some reason

1044
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:58,880
there's

1045
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,119
something they need to help upkeep their

1046
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,680
space that's usually just free i know

1047
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,800
our archery folks during the summer

1048
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,520
go to an archery range outdoors and

1049
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,599
indoors in the winter

1050
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,280
and again they have a small donation

1051
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,760
just to cover the space but there's

1052
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,680
everything from these martial arts music

1053
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,280
scribal guild

1054
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,839
and then we have what are called events

1055
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,320
and events are these social gatherings

1056
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,240
and anybody can attend them you don't

1057
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,160
have to be a member but there is a small

1058
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,720
fee associated with them if you are a

1059
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,359
member of our group you do get a small

1060
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,680
discount because members true members

1061
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,440
are paying members that's how they're

1062
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,079
seen but what's fun is there's no pay to

1063
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,160
play i mean like i said some of these

1064
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,839
practices

1065
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,000
you need to pay a small fee to get in

1066
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,320
the door because it's a you know it's a

1067
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,520
business

1068
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,839
like the archery shop for example or we

1069
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,160
need to cover the cost of the rental of

1070
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,520
the space

1071
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,040
now the biggest

1072
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,520
event that we have in the known world is

1073
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,400
something called pensic and is a huge

1074
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,280
camping event with about 10 000 people

1075
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,760
so not not even as big as defcon if

1076
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,280
you've been there but it's it's really

1077
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,240
large

1078
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,280
um

1079
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,720
and uh

1080
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,880
this these are some pictures of the

1081
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,319
pensic war

1082
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,240
it's located

1083
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,640
just north of pittsburgh pennsylvania uh

1084
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,280
it's called cooper's link campground and

1085
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,760
you can see we've got court you can see

1086
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,359
the photograph on the right shows you

1087
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,280
just how big this is it's it's huge

1088
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,680
camping space and we have everything

1089
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,560
from shopping to the arts to

1090
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,920
you know fighting and fencing and all

1091
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,440
the things that i've mentioned already

1092
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,720
so to play the game just to

1093
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,480
fundamentally create what are called

1094
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,119
personas and this is a picture of me

1095
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,000
my my clothing which we refer to as garb

1096
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,640
changes kind of depending on what event

1097
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,040
i'm attending or what i'm doing but my

1098
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,160
persona

1099
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,040
is

1100
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,359
somebody called beatrice to winter

1101
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,000
i my i've given some background to my

1102
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,880
persona i'm a medieval corner and a

1103
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,400
corner in

1104
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,560
europe at the time is actually called a

1105
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,599
crowner and a crowner is somebody who is

1106
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,119
a tax collector

1107
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,079
um

1108
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,720
my back story is that my father died

1109
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
from the plague so i took over his job

1110
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,240
which is really one of the few ways

1111
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,640
women got to do much of anything and i

1112
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,040
travel extensively

1113
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,359
so your persona includes your name your

1114
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,160
history your culture all of these things

1115
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,720
and that is essentially

1116
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,880
what i have to share with you

1117
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,520
i leave you with this final quote

1118
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,560
because

1119
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,720
i didn't start out to get into security

1120
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,119
like perhaps many of you are

1121
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,359
i didn't even start out intending to get

1122
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,640
into iet

1123
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,640
and i certainly did not intend initially

1124
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,560
to get into the sca

1125
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,640
but ultimately i think i wound up

1126
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,440
exactly where i needed to be

1127
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,839
thank you so

1128
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,880
much hey

1129
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,480
see kathy i told you you'd nail it

1130
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,280
high job you're on mute

1131
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,359
it's about this time this captain uh

1132
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,119
went ahead and went off duty

1133
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,200
so uh we're going to have bryson bort

1134
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,440
see you the rest of the way uh again

1135
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,760
kathy fantastic job on these slides and

1136
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,200
uh on this talk

1137
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,800
people are raving about it in the chat

1138
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,960
bryson let's go ahead and uh go ahead

1139
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,880
and take it from here all right we got

1140
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,760
rob cued up but kathy just one question

1141
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,839
because i think this sums it up and it's

1142
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,000
always coming up why

1143
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,120
is it always dns

1144
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,440
[Laughter]

1145
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,040
because people are really bad with

1146
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,920
numbers so we you know we want to give

1147
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,760
them those fancy names

1148
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,240
and when that connection breaks down it

1149
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,879
breaks everything

1150
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,119
not an exciting answer but it's the

1151
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,960
truth

1152
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,400
no it's one of those critical pieces

1153
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,079
when it doesn't work nothing works

1154
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,280
that's right

1155
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,280
absolutely

1156
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,960
all right well kathy thank you very much
