1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,159
so

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,440
hey everybody to get started um

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,120
so everyone else has their two pieces to

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,120
it in their talk so unless you've read

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,120
all the bio online you don't know that

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,360
i'm doing magic tricks too so

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,000
we're going to open up with something um

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,440
we're going to talk about

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,400
the

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,800
one dollar bill and how this is your

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,960
active directory so

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,000
your actual directory is clean and crisp

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,080
perfect right there's no

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,080
deviations to it or maybe it looks a

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,039
little bit

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,558
more like this

17
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:33,440
uh

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,480
maybe

19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,880
you know you've got

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,840
a

21
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,200
tear

22
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
in part of it maybe over here you've got

23
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
you know another

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,920
tear in part and part of it

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,760
or you know maybe

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
it's actually

27
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,520
got a nice big hole

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,719
in it

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,399
so

30
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,079
but you can kind of mask the whole right

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,359
so if you kind of just pulled up the

32
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,520
dollar you could still spin this like

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,760
this still passes as an active directory

34
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,000
like this is fine right

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,520
um but what we're going to talk about

36
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,479
today is

37
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,159
how we can basically make your active

38
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,040
directory whole again

39
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,920
and we just use some magic tricks

40
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,960
so at the end of the talk i will um

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,280
be explaining how to do some of these

42
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,560
magic tricks

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,280
so

44
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,720
i'm gonna let that linger for a little

45
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
while though while i share my screen and

46
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,680
we'll do

47
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,439
i guess the boring half

48
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,000
of the talk

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,960
angela can you see

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,280
my slides okay now

51
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,200
yes looks great cool thank you

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,240
all right

53
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,720
well thanks everybody for showing up

54
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,320
um i am

55
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,840
brandon colley

56
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,320
you can reach out to me on twitter uh

57
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,040
also in the slack at tech brandon

58
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,119
i've got it all minimized right now so

59
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,719
i'm looking forward to seeing everything

60
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,799
you're telling me here in a little while

61
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,880
but i want to focus on being able to do

62
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,799
one thing at a time because as you can

63
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,920
see down there this is actually the

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,439
first time i've given

65
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,598
a talk

66
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,319
so a little bit more about me i am 15

67
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,000
years experienced as assist admin

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,239
mostly in the education space

69
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,280
and i say that i'm fairly new to infosec

70
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
and i say that because i've really

71
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,360
started to shift more into

72
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,599
that realm over the last year

73
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,599
both professionally and also kind of

74
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,120
after hours learning a little bit more

75
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,040
about stuff

76
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,840
so

77
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,040
this talk is kind of a blend of some of

78
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,599
those things

79
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,519
all right so if that's who i am we're

80
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,280
going to talk about who you are

81
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,879
so my target audience today is

82
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,920
students

83
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,239
blue teamers um some msp providers um

84
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,879
mostly just newbies and you see like me

85
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,560
right um

86
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,360
so

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,000
the newbies like like me that have 15

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,400
years experience well

89
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,879
i still kind of view myself as a newbie

90
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,480
in a lot of different ways and as you'll

91
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,400
see some of the things that surprised me

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,879
about uh the simulation maybe they

93
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,800
wouldn't have surprised you um or maybe

94
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
they would so anyway that's i'm telling

95
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,159
you who you are

96
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,159
so a few assumptions about

97
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,560
what your active directory

98
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,959
uh looks like today or what you do today

99
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,239
as a bluetooth

100
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,319
so you patch right so you patch your

101
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,080
servers eventually right

102
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,159
you scan you check the vulnerabilities

103
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,000
and you sometimes even remediate one or

104
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,480
two of them

105
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,440
and you log

106
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,200
you collect the logs and some of the

107
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,360
logs

108
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,879
and so basically if you've done that

109
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,280
then you're ready to hack yourself right

110
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,519
so

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,159
before you really kind of begin on this

112
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,439
and what we're really talking about

113
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,480
right now uh is an adversary inhalation

114
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,760
so you've heard that before where um

115
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,159
purple team exercises and stuff like

116
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:06,879
that

117
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,280
but from my point of view uh i don't

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,840
have a red team i don't have a blue team

119
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,720
um heck i don't even have a sock right

120
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,440
so um if you're like me in a smaller

121
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,639
institution

122
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,519
um or smaller business

123
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,560
you may be

124
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,360
it may be you and a small team um so

125
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,400
before you really get started in that i

126
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,240
say your stakeholders so seek approval

127
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
from the people who you need approval

128
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,080
from um

129
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,800
don't just go in guns blazing

130
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
and and such

131
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,040
do it right communicate to your teams

132
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,880
unless you want to do some

133
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,800
some testing of a sock or whatever but

134
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,160
communicate to the people that need to

135
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,639
be communicated to

136
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,160
and then take notes

137
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,440
um

138
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,360
and so the kind of the two kind of notes

139
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
that i've taken through this is a

140
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
playbook which is essentially just a raw

141
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,919
list of the commands or the steps that

142
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,680
i'm taking to

143
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,759
perform

144
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,280
some of the tests

145
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,919
and then also the output

146
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,000
you maybe also have some screenshots you

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,840
may have what your expected outcome was

148
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,960
versus your actual outcome

149
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,120
uh but those are all going to be helpful

150
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,639
as well as just kind of normal

151
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,639
note-taking that you may need

152
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,039
to help with a write-up later so if your

153
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,759
stakeholders are expecting some sort of

154
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,479
big write-up

155
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,360
okay so

156
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,479
if we're going to

157
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,639
be the adversary

158
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,759
first thing you got to do is you're

159
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,440
going to choose your fighter right

160
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,280
so my kids are super psyched with um

161
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,639
like these fighting games like smash

162
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,720
bros right now so i figured we'd do like

163
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,280
a smash bros style choose your character

164
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,400
here and

165
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,759
so some of the apts that are known as

166
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,880
rocket kitten and deputy dog and voodoo

167
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,039
bear so how do you pick your adversary

168
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,319
um

169
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,080
there is a wonderful website and i'm

170
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,759
gonna keep talking about

171
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,080
links and stuffs i've got a link slide

172
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,000
at the end i'll be happy to share all

173
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,800
that

174
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,560
in slack

175
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,440
later on too but basically

176
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,520
mitre has a really good

177
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,720
set of the apt groups so they'll go

178
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,600
through and explain what they are and

179
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
what they do and what they do

180
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,960
is kind of how you pick the one that um

181
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,039
you want to be your fighter right so

182
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,600
if you're in education space you pick

183
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
one that may target education space if

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,479
you're in the industrial technology you

185
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,120
may do that versus banking or medical

186
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,560
so that's going to help you kind of

187
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,840
choose or you could do it i did and just

188
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,919
choose the easy one based on the

189
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,000
abilities um

190
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,840
the apt3

191
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,520
was kind of one of the standard ones um

192
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,440
mitre already wrote out a lot of it and

193
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,800
did a lot of the work

194
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
for me so that's where i started

195
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,360
the

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,680
apt techniques so kind of so once you

197
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,520
get passed through

198
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,039
your group you're going to be met with

199
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,039
something like this so here you're going

200
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,160
to see things like the password cracking

201
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,800
the local account creation and some of

202
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,120
the sticky keys persistence so those are

203
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,639
all things that we're going to do

204
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,880
in our emulation there are also some

205
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,720
things listed in here that

206
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,479
i just went ahead and did not plan to do

207
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,280
so like i said i use the cheat code

208
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,000
right so the up down up down a b select

209
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,639
start cheat code for me uh and selecting

210
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,199
my fighter was because of the field

211
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,840
manual that was already built

212
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,840
this field manual is awesome this is

213
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,400
just a small part of it that talks about

214
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,280
some of the discovery examples

215
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,879
that are in that apt3

216
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,960
toolkit so what you're basically looking

217
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,800
at here is

218
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,639
at least part of the playbook that i was

219
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,599
talking about earlier

220
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,440
if you want to go a little bit further

221
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,120
or if you pick a different adversary

222
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,440
where you they don't have a pre-built

223
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,800
field manual the atomic red team

224
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,120
red canary has a

225
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
github again i'll get you the link this

226
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,360
is just a quick excerpt from

227
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,560
one of

228
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,599
theirs

229
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,280
you can map those techniques to specific

230
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,560
um

231
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,919
methods of performing those tests so if

232
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,200
you don't have it already written out

233
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,039
for you and you don't know how to go

234
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,279
about doing something like creating a

235
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,919
new admin account

236
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,080
on a windows machine this also goes

237
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
through mac and linux and a couple other

238
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,200
different

239
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,160
tests

240
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,240
so it's going to walk you through

241
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,480
methods that you can use to accomplish

242
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,760
those

243
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,399
so that's if you want to go a little bit

244
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,080
more than what i did here

245
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,560
all right so we're almost done getting

246
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
started

247
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,600
so

248
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,120
some of the things that once you kind of

249
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,560
know what you're going after

250
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,240
what some of your tests are going to be

251
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,000
i think it's important to

252
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,600
set your goals

253
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,720
and identify your outcomes or your

254
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,519
expected outcomes i guess right so

255
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,360
what you think

256
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,080
you might find and what your goals are

257
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,320
may start to kind of shift a little bit

258
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,800
as you start through this process

259
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,880
that's also why setting the scope is

260
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,279
important and i'm not talking about like

261
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,360
a red team scope where you follow the

262
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,399
rules

263
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,000
talking more about following your own

264
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,040
rules

265
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,360
if you say that you're only going to run

266
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
these commands

267
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,800
only run those commands

268
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,440
don't deviate too much from that

269
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,519
i did not take my own advice and you'll

270
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,760
see i deviated a little bit because it's

271
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,480
really easy to do

272
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,720
one kind of tip for that

273
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,800
and that i tried to use was to set a

274
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
list for next time so you're

275
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,720
anticipating today you're doing your

276
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,160
first adversary in late yeah sorry wow i

277
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,600
can't even spell adversary either um

278
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,920
emulation so you'll do another one right

279
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,000
so make a list for next time and then

280
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,399
start your playbook

281
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,519
so what i did was

282
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,240
kind of narrow in on three main

283
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,920
areas and so the rest of the talk is

284
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,279
going to basically

285
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,279
be some of the discovery enumeration

286
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,000
reconnaissance type type stuff um

287
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
basically looking around

288
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and then did a little bit of a temp set

289
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
privilege

290
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,640
escalation

291
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,279
another word that's hard to say

292
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,519
and some credential dumps

293
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,360
then lastly we did a little bit of

294
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,040
persistence

295
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,439
tests

296
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,240
so here you'll see the very first

297
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,760
command i mean i think it's the very

298
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,160
first one on the field manual

299
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,720
see who the local admin is right so here

300
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,120
what i did was

301
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,200
i got a laptop

302
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,279
connected it to the domain

303
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,320
uh logged in with a normal user account

304
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
i just kind of assumed that i would be

305
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,279
able to

306
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,680
get user credentials some way you know

307
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,640
phishing

308
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,680
um guessing spraying any sort of methods

309
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,079
to get just raw credentials

310
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,839
i did a lot of assume breach type stuff

311
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,160
here so i'm going to kind of flow into a

312
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,839
little bit of the assume admin type

313
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,920
pieces too but as far as this first

314
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,640
stuff this is normal at a normal user

315
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,920
behavior so your well it's abnormal user

316
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,839
behavior but this is a normal user

317
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,600
account sorry

318
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,760
so your normal user account

319
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,920
you can see who an admin is you can see

320
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,720
what domain groups there are

321
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,040
so there's the domain admin list

322
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,880
so now you know who the domain admins

323
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,920
are here's also a local admin group that

324
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,160
contains several individuals you also

325
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,800
know now who other accounts are that you

326
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,120
can go after

327
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,399
and so now that you know who to go after

328
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,560
you can start querying those specific

329
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,360
accounts so you can get things inside

330
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,880
here such as what other group

331
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,800
memberships they're members of some of

332
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,639
the password details

333
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,200
one of the earlier talks um and i'm

334
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,920
sorry i'm nervous and forgot uh his name

335
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,480
uh lemon mr lemon from this morning was

336
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,600
talking about

337
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,440
password information password not

338
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,600
required being in here

339
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,320
also something in the comments field

340
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,760
we'll talk more about that here in a

341
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,399
little bit too

342
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,040
so then we shift and we can use these ds

343
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,519
query from here you can

344
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,240
you have to be an admin to install it

345
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,000
but you don't have to be an admin to run

346
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,320
it so if you happen to have it or in

347
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,040
this case obviously just testing with it

348
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,839
i just ran an ldap query to pull all of

349
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,519
the user admins

350
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,160
so here's a snip of some of my coworkers

351
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,519
administrative accounts and what their

352
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,720
names are and the descriptions of those

353
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,839
the second little one here is all of the

354
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,000
server groups so here you'll see the

355
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
server admin group or specific

356
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
administrators that might be on servers

357
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,279
so

358
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,279
what i learned from

359
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,680
the discovery portion was that your ad

360
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,880
is public

361
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,360
or at least my id was public

362
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,800
you can view

363
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,480
whatever you want you can do a

364
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,720
full-blown dump of all the users all the

365
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,399
groups all the computers of your active

366
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,959
directory

367
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,720
another takeaway was that description

368
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,320
and comment field so

369
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
watch what you're putting in those i

370
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,199
know

371
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,040
there have been multiple

372
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,760
um attacks that have been done

373
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,920
or findings that have been found

374
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,600
where people put passwords in there or

375
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,760
are just way too descriptive inside of

376
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,360
their thinking that it's a private field

377
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,600
so some of the other so how can you

378
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,959
catch some of this so that's also what

379
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,720
i'm trying to get through with this it's

380
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,240
you know it's fun to do

381
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,399
but what are we gonna learn from it so

382
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,560
you know who installs rsat right like if

383
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,399
outside an admin if you have a normal

384
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,600
user account

385
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,639
that you get an alert on or a log on

386
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,959
that someone installed rsat that could

387
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,279
be an indicator of a compromise and then

388
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,519
also what are you doing to monitor for

389
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,360
this kind of reconnaissance what's

390
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,519
normal behavior considered in your

391
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,720
institution

392
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
um are people even running command

393
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,519
prompt like do your users even need to

394
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,240
be able to boot up the command prompt or

395
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,079
do they do that on a regular basis for

396
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,440
some reason

397
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,360
uh also who's running these net commands

398
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,600
right like that's kind of a suspicious

399
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,279
behavior especially if it's more than

400
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,839
one or two

401
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,480
so the second piece is the uh privilege

402
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,000
escalation

403
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,440
and so this one

404
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,040
actually failed for me which was great

405
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,279
as a blue team where i was excited that

406
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,720
we actually seemed to be doing something

407
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,920
right

408
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,680
which unfortunately was basically just

409
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,440
having the anti-virus

410
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,920
so in this case we tried to escalate

411
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,240
privileges using this power up tool

412
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,320
uh and let me download it as soon as i

413
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,120
attempted to run it it got flagged it

414
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,320
got deleted

415
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,079
from the system um so cool next step

416
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,360
um

417
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,279
let's just shut it off right let's okay

418
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,360
i'm i'm an admin now like i can be an

419
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,480
admin let's just pretend i'm an admin um

420
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,360
well

421
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,800
look at me i did that's two things that

422
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,399
i did right

423
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,320
i made it so you can't turn off the

424
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,160
real-time protection

425
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,839
which is great until you realize that

426
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,959
you can just run a registry edit to turn

427
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,638
off real-time protection

428
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,040
funny enough though uh

429
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,240
my limited um abilities i couldn't get

430
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,480
it to run locally still so even after i

431
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
turned it off um i believe it was

432
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,199
turning itself back on after a log on or

433
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,240
a log off so i still cannot run local

434
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,480
scripts and so this is where i started

435
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,000
to get a little bit

436
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,480
deviate deviation um i ran some ps exec

437
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,880
i could get a remote shell now with an

438
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,240
admin account

439
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,000
and um but i wanted to do more right so

440
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,480
nowhere in my playbook had anything

441
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,880
about metasploit but

442
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,440
yeah right okay um maybe it's just a

443
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,120
little bit i mean it's still using ps

444
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,160
exact

445
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,519
uh just with um interpreter shell

446
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,560
so from here a couple little pieces that

447
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,399
i had to navigate but i was able to do a

448
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,199
hashtag so boom all your local account

449
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,160
hashes

450
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,000
uh i've got those now

451
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,440
so now i know

452
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,040
that um you know anyone with admin

453
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,160
credentials essentially knows all local

454
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,600
passwords or at least could

455
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,440
you know with enough time

456
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,759
uh and then i went further down the

457
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,360
rabbit hole because i wanted some domain

458
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,199
stuff right like we're not local users

459
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,360
all the time um so i want to get some

460
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,639
domain stuff

461
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,920
so with the interpreter shell um booted

462
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,519
up mimikatz ran a credential dump

463
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,040
and went ahead and logged in a couple

464
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,559
times with a couple different domain

465
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,520
accounts

466
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,240
and was able to pull some hashes from

467
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,119
the memory of that system so now not

468
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,199
only do i have

469
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,520
local credentials i may have some domain

470
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,640
credentials

471
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,400
they have my own domain credential here

472
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,199
okay

473
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,039
this one i don't think it was on the

474
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,480
field manual but it was definitely

475
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,079
something that was part of what i wanted

476
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,119
to do

477
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,799
um

478
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,400
someone talked about kerber roasting

479
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,080
earlier too and people are like what's

480
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,400
gerber roasting and i um i'm not gonna

481
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,200
explain it because i don't know

482
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,840
exactly i just know that spns kinda are

483
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,440
important and kind of suck right now

484
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,120
because um

485
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,919
i ran this this is an impact thing right

486
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,760
from a cali machine

487
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
get user sbn

488
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,520
i've got username password those are

489
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,080
non-admin credentials just any domain

490
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,760
i'm not even attacking a workstation

491
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,720
right now

492
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,320
and i dumped all of the sbns from my

493
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,440
domain including the hashes

494
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,160
and what sucks is that top one is

495
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,480
literally the domain administrator

496
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,600
account

497
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,400
so

498
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,360
that

499
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,679
 right i can say that now we decided

500
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,840
that

501
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,880
all right so i kind of went through this

502
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,440
as i went so what did i learn av blocked

503
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,640
some stuff

504
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,520
um

505
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,760
i did a good job on setting up some

506
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,960
group policies that prevent or require

507
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,799
administrative credentials to do remote

508
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,320
sessions

509
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
it blocked just normal accounts from

510
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,280
being able to do certain things

511
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,559
but i did get all those hashes

512
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
so the third piece of the puzzle is the

513
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,679
persistence

514
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,480
um

515
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,080
some of the fun persistence stuff is

516
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,400
just basically two lines of code that

517
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
create a new account and then add that

518
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,480
account to the admin group

519
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,640
so i mean you don't need a shell to do

520
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,200
this you just write a quick script to do

521
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,240
this

522
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,640
and then when and then this third one is

523
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,240
just showing that it got put in the

524
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,799
admins group

525
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,720
to take that a step further

526
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,880
let's go ahead and schedule it so we're

527
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,640
going to create a scheduled task

528
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,880
uh here i'm calling calculator

529
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,440
but you can easily replace that with a

530
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,640
batch file or powershell script

531
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,880
run in a system every time someone logs

532
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,520
in and you now have a backdoor account

533
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,039
even more fun

534
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,520
is sticky keys so

535
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,559
uh this was new to me so if it's not new

536
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,240
to you and you think i'm stupid because

537
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,000
i have 15 years experience and i didn't

538
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,320
know i could do this i'm sorry

539
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,400
but i think it's cool so

540
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,960
you can redirect the sticky keys

541
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,360
executable to the command prompt and

542
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,280
when you do that you have a command

543
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,160
prompt that runs this system so

544
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,440
i'm gonna try to do this so i hope i

545
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,760
don't screw this up too much um i could

546
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,640
not embed this video so here's my plug

547
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,559
here's my twitter here's everyone i've

548
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,840
talked to

549
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,480
uh this is what it looks like so

550
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,320
on a log on screen

551
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,880
before you've logged in whatsoever

552
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,280
you hit the hit the shift key a couple

553
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,080
of times and boom now you have a shell

554
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,520
so

555
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,240
that's what that looks like

556
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,960
so what did we learn through persistence

557
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,520
so a lot of this is behavioral and

558
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,360
indicators of compromise is what we're

559
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,679
talking about now right so

560
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,799
we don't get alerts on local admin

561
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,760
creation or maybe we should right

562
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,840
same with schedule tasks why do end

563
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,240
users need to do that thing

564
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,000
sticky keys did

565
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,960
alert in windows defender but it didn't

566
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,440
do anything it didn't stop it uh it just

567
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,400
said hey there is suspicious behavior

568
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
so if you're not monitoring for those

569
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
sort of things and you're not acting on

570
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,840
those sort of things you may be missing

571
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,880
out

572
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,799
and perhaps the biggest takeaway from

573
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,720
everything is limit your local admin so

574
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,039
local admin means a lot

575
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,240
especially when you start looking at

576
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,799
being an admin on multiple machines once

577
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,919
you go from being a normal user to an

578
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,159
admin on that machine that machine

579
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,080
happens to be an admin on all of the

580
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,520
machines or a small group of the

581
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,600
machines

582
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,720
your scope widens very quickly

583
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,480
and as a red teamer

584
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,799
you could get in very quickly

585
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:31,840
so

586
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,679
uh that's kind of been my big takeaway

587
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,120
from

588
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,919
what i had done

589
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,320
so your takeaways are you can do eat

590
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,360
and so do what i did like just

591
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,039
literally follow it if you're super

592
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,280
interested in uh ping me and i'll

593
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,840
literally give you everything that i ran

594
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,280
um

595
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
and if you think that this is like too

596
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,799
low level for you uh this is to noob um

597
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,000
then

598
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,320
just try to test your defense right so

599
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,200
you have an edr solution you have a sock

600
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,760
we got all the logs uh well then test

601
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,240
those things right if you haven't

602
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,280
already and maybe you have already um

603
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,799
and so if you have them poke deeper in

604
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,000
there so

605
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,039
um even the apt3 field manual that i

606
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,320
went off of

607
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,120
even still had uh file share enumeration

608
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,360
stuff in there that we didn't do

609
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,440
uac bypass was in there

610
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,840
golden ticket passed the hash

611
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,440
lateral movement was something that we

612
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,360
didn't even touch on

613
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,840
so there's a huge huge

614
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,600
group of things that you can do so

615
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,520
tailor it to what you know

616
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,000
you already have in your environment

617
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
and

618
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,640
just try it out so if you haven't

619
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,799
already

620
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,799
all right and here are

621
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,640
all my links i'm going to take a quick

622
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,440
drink let you look at them i'm going to

623
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,679
i will copy those and throw them in

624
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,720
slack

625
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,039
um or if you if you miss it or meet him

626
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,400
later in me i don't get that for you

627
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,880
so the last part of the talk

628
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,880
magic

629
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,840
all right

630
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,039
so i'm going to stop share

631
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,919
stop that from continuing to do the

632
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,360
magic thing because that's really

633
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,640
annoying um bear with me for one minute

634
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,679
and angela alright if you're still there

635
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,760
can you help me with some of this stuff

636
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,320
in a little bit

637
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,720
i can awesome give me a second

638
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,960
all right so i wanted to prevent that

639
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,559
scrunch when people touch their

640
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,159
microphones and stuff

641
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,360
all right so first first i guess before

642
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,960
i say anything else

643
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,039
if you don't want to learn how magic

644
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,919
tricks are done if you like to um

645
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,919
you know live in a world where magic

646
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,039
exists

647
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,080
um go watch the other talk for a little

648
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,760
while um

649
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,520
because i'm i'm sorry i'm breaking

650
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,880
magician's code here but there's your

651
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,640
warning right okay

652
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,039
so the dollar bill trick right

653
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,480
um

654
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,080
i didn't actually

655
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,039
rip everything i ripped some stuff

656
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,320
um so i did rip these two corners

657
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,600
i did not

658
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,960
actually rip

659
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,440
the whole face off obviously

660
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,919
um so what you do in this sort of trick

661
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,600
uh which i think is a really powerful

662
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,960
trick um

663
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,919
you essentially fold this piece down and

664
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,840
you'll force you'll fold it toward

665
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,159
yourself um here i'm folding it toward

666
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:40,960
you

667
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,840
um

668
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,440
and then you just kind of pretend to rip

669
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,679
it right and you can make that sound so

670
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,440
it sounds like you're going to rip it i

671
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,760
like to pretend that i eat it

672
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,400
or you can throw it away or whatever

673
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,080
the second piece of that trick to kind

674
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,919
of hide it where you can rotate it so

675
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,760
you don't the audience won't see that

676
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,400
flap right there is how you can fold up

677
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,799
those sides and then you can say yeah

678
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,559
you could still spend it like you don't

679
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,480
have to have george washington's face to

680
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,640
spend money um

681
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,480
and so that lets you kind of show the

682
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,400
entirety of the dollar

683
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,080
then the last piece you can kind of fold

684
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,679
it in half again

685
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,520
and there you can show

686
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,360
that it's fully gone

687
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,120
and it also gives you two little handles

688
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
to kind of hold on to the edges

689
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
so when you pop it and you pop it fast

690
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,799
and hard

691
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,600
you can't see the edges on there

692
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,919
um so that's basically that

693
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,760
dollar bill magic trick you do

694
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,279
unfortunately have a dollar that has a

695
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,480
small rip or hole in it um but again you

696
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,470
can still spend that money so

697
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,159
[Music]

698
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,559
all right

699
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,120
angela i'm going to have you

700
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,360
um help me with a couple card magic

701
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,240
tricks

702
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,039
okay

703
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,799
all right so this first one i'm just

704
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,400
going to have you tell me when you want

705
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,000
me to stop so what i'm going to do is

706
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,960
i'm just going to kind of dribble

707
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,799
through the cards like that okay and you

708
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,640
just while i'm doing that just tell me

709
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,679
to stop whenever you want

710
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,640
so

711
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,520
okay

712
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,240
so right there we've got two it's hard

713
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,840
to see over the zoom i think but

714
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,840
basically what we've got is two

715
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,399
two decks

716
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,400
told me where to stop you stopped right

717
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,360
here in the middle of the deck

718
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,840
so you could have picked any card you

719
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,080
wanted but this is your card

720
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,400
we'll go ahead and we'll replace it back

721
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,600
in the middle of the deck and we're

722
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,559
going to see

723
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,559
if we can get the deck to

724
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,400
um just tell us in a certain way

725
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,240
what your card is see if it stands out

726
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,840
in any way

727
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,880
no

728
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,679
all of these cards

729
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,919
look about the same

730
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,880
except for that one

731
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,960
that one's different

732
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,880
so your card

733
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,440
the kind of clubs

734
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,720
all right

735
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,080
again if you don't want to know magic

736
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,199
tricks here's a

737
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,080
look at that there's

738
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,279
two tens

739
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,440
two different colors

740
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,960
your setup on this

741
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,799
um what you're doing is basically

742
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,520
forcing um someone to pick the card you

743
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,200
want them to pick so this is called a

744
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,799
card force

745
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,799
so you get the red card on the bottom

746
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,559
that way no one can see it you can

747
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,799
actually show most of the deck if you

748
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,919
want to

749
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,520
and you can even show the faces of the

750
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,000
deck here too because there's no you may

751
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,960
because you're going to show them that

752
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,840
one you may not show them that top top

753
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,200
card but the card that you pick is going

754
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,559
to be on the top that's the card that i

755
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,080
want you to force to pick there's a

756
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,840
couple different ways to do this but

757
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,520
what i did was just call the crisscross

758
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,960
force

759
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,640
and from there you know you can tell me

760
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,919
to stop wherever you want in the middle

761
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,240
of the deck and what i'm going to do is

762
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,679
i'm just going to kind of swing that one

763
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,880
down and put that one on top sideways

764
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,399
just like

765
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,120
you would cut the cards however the card

766
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,279
you actually cut to is right here the

767
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,640
card on the top of the deck is the one

768
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,000
that's right here okay

769
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,679
so that's how you that's an easy way

770
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:06,960
that you could force a card and then

771
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,640
from there it's just you just complete

772
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,520
the

773
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,399
uh

774
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,799
the uh the cut and

775
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,840
you've got your your

776
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,679
card that's a good one

777
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,960
thank you

778
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,120
all right we got a couple more i think

779
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,559
i've still got

780
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,880
some time i've got like 10 minutes cool

781
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,960
all right so um this one what we're

782
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,760
going to do is call the card control so

783
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,640
um

784
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,440
just

785
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,279
reach out your finger and touch one of

786
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,200
the cards

787
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,880
or you can just tell me

788
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,360
where you want to stop

789
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,279
right there where your thumb is now yeah

790
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,799
okay

791
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,520
right here okay so

792
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,880
i'm showing you and showing me at the

793
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,840
same time

794
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,559
not that it matters

795
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,960
all right so this is your card

796
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,080
we're going to put it here in the middle

797
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,840
of the

798
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,799
deck and then we're going to give the

799
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,919
deck a couple cuts

800
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,279
we can even shuffle the deck

801
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,069
[Applause]

802
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,520
and i'm hoping i didn't mess this one up

803
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,360
already

804
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,520
but so all these we already saw those

805
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,840
those are the same we already also kind

806
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,480
of saw that you know they're not all

807
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,840
um

808
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,840
the same card sorry some of the lighting

809
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,720
here kind of stinks

810
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,000
but

811
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,360
what i'm thinking we can do with this

812
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,640
one again is we can

813
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,480
probably make it stand out the same way

814
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,720
we made the other one stand out

815
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,360
except for not red

816
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,279
card that is face down

817
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,840
so this was called a card control

818
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,320
i did the exact same sort of

819
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,919
trick

820
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,600
on this one

821
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,000
you select your card

822
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,840
you do actually push it into the middle

823
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,679
of the deck

824
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,159
i can show you from the reverse side

825
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,080
this is really difficult to show people

826
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,399
or presume but what you do is you so you

827
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,799
push down on the card and when you bring

828
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,679
it in you kind of create this break

829
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,159
here i'm going to pin myself

830
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,039
to watch myself real fast there

831
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,039
um so you're pushing it in and creating

832
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,200
this break in between the two cards are

833
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,039
the two packets and then you grab about

834
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,120
half of this packet and you can pull

835
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,720
that down and then you grab the other

836
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,960
half and you pull that up and then what

837
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,559
you've done is you've kept that card on

838
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,799
the top okay

839
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,720
and then once you have it on top you can

840
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,559
do pretty much whatever you want with it

841
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,799
for this one i did kind of this weird

842
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,559
turn thing

843
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,200
and i was doing that because i wanted

844
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,559
the top card

845
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,360
here to be in the palm of my hand and so

846
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,120
when i pull this up

847
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,919
and flip it that you kind of saw i'm

848
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,279
actually keeping that one face

849
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,000
up and all of the rest of them face down

850
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,240
and then i just cut it so it was

851
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,399
in the center of the deck

852
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,959
that's cool

853
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,720
all right i promised

854
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,720
panky

855
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,640
that's my grand finale

856
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
all right same sort of thing actually

857
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,240
why don't you just once you tell me a

858
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,600
card

859
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,559
tell you a card yeah what card you want

860
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,600
uh

861
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,559
two of spades

862
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,959
all right two of spades

863
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,159
so this time we're going to do the same

864
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,679
sort of thing that we just did

865
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,120
push it in the middle of the deck

866
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,600
mix them up

867
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,039
i can even mix them up more this way

868
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,919
and your two of spades

869
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,360
is what

870
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,840
oh okay so well i thought i had that one

871
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,679
on top but we'll put the not it was a

872
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,200
nine of clubs

873
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,880
but the nine of clubs in between the

874
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,240
pancakes

875
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,919
and we'll see if we can't make it turn

876
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,360
into

877
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,479
the two of spades

878
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,120
oh okay so now i've got the nine of

879
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,518
clubs

880
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,890
two spades in the pancake nice

881
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,709
[Music]

882
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,480
it only works if you have pancakes right

883
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,200
it only works with pancakes

884
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,159
um

885
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,600
it's actually i've heard it called the

886
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,039
pancake before because you give it you

887
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,559
give the card to someone and you just

888
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,240
put it in their hand and then you just

889
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,760
hold it like this like you tell them to

890
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,000
pancake the card

891
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,399
so it was legitimately called a pancake

892
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,760
trick that's great

893
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,600
but this so this trick uses something

894
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,840
called um a double lift

895
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,519
so we still we did the same sort of

896
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,320
thing

897
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,120
previously where um we kind of hid the

898
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,640
card in the middle or pretended to hide

899
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,840
the card in the middle

900
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,240
but to do a double lift all you're doing

901
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,880
is actually taking the two top cards and

902
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,640
you're turning them over and pretending

903
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,840
they're one card

904
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,679
and there's a couple different ways that

905
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,840
you can do that um

906
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,760
so one way is you can kind of push the

907
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,000
cards and this is way exaggerated but

908
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,519
you kind of push the cards so they're

909
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,559
really

910
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,399
bezel like that so it's easier to grab

911
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,000
two from the back

912
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,440
and so you could grab the two from the

913
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,760
back and do it like that

914
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,600
the other way you could do it is you can

915
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,120
kind of grab them from this

916
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,640
oh i'm sorry there's my 10 minute

917
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,679
warning

918
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,039
um

919
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,320
grab them from the side where you can

920
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,399
almost kind of count the cards here with

921
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,640
your finger if you've got them slightly

922
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,559
moved a little bit

923
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,440
but anyway that's uh i've got a link i

924
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,960
think for how to do a double lift a

925
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,240
couple different ways to do it but

926
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,159
that's the whole idea is you just kind

927
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,840
of show in one direction

928
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,159
and then you have a different card there

929
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,560
so that's your double lift

930
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,599
um i've got a couple little like

931
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,000
spins and tricks and stuff but i'm

932
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,560
interested in doing some q and a so i

933
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,480
could take a little drink here too

934
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,560
so sorry i should have done this first

935
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,839
if you've got any for me angela

936
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,359
otherwise i'll start looking through

937
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,320
here yeah obviously like i i wasn't

938
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,879
able to look while we were doing magic

939
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,399
but um

940
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,560
all the all the responses from the first

941
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,918
half were like

942
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,079
really good i heard i saw someone say

943
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,000
that um a previous dark net diaries um

944
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,040
episode refers to some of the same uh

945
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,839
steps so that's really great

946
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,679
um

947
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,800
a lot of

948
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,960
encouragement and just like

949
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,119
everybody really enjoyed the beginning

950
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,720
let's see

951
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,119
i see i'll go backwards here real quick

952
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,200
i saw uh randy asked where i where i

953
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,839
learned magic tricks um so i've got a

954
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,599
couple links um

955
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,839
i have there's a book i think the royal

956
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,560
road to card magic is is a pretty good

957
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,480
one that gets you some of those

958
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,720
foundation type things but really the

959
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,000
first things i found was um chris ramsey

960
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,240
on

961
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,400
youtube

962
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,640
does some pretty cool magic tricks and a

963
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,800
lot and he'll kind of code them in there

964
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,320
and say

965
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,960
you know this is easy this one's

966
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,280
anybody can do this or self-working or

967
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,200
other things that

968
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,119
make it really easy

969
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,560
to learn some of that

970
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,640
alex pandrea is another one so a lot of

971
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,280
youtube really um is kind of where i

972
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,079
learned some of that stuff

973
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,680
great um

974
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,200
i know

975
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,079
so uh yeah i i've definitely heard of

976
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,960
like companies bringing in magicians

977
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,359
but i don't think they ever necessarily

978
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,720
show you how to do the trick

979
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,560
that's true

980
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,000
um that was cool

981
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,200
and uh yeah somebody randy also mentions

982
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,280
that right um

983
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,960
there's like professional magicians who

984
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,680
come in and do social engineering uh

985
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,920
on physical pen test engagement which is

986
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,599
kind of cool to help like you know

987
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,760
training

988
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,000
yeah i think the

989
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,200
the mind is very similar um which kind

990
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,599
of that it's actually funny i so

991
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,320
magic was kind of my thing before

992
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,240
like security was really i mean so i

993
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,440
kind of went through and i bought a

994
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,200
bunch of magic books and i read like

995
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,680
half of one and then i got tired of it

996
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,680
and then i started getting more into

997
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,040
like um the mental side of it and then

998
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,960
that kind of the social engineering kind

999
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,640
of and then that kind of turned into

1000
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
some of the security type stuff so i

1001
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,720
think it all kind of definitely is tied

1002
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,640
together

1003
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,920
definitely um

1004
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,480
appreciation for how you did your

1005
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,800
video with the technical demo there and

1006
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,240
uh

1007
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,200
you know

1008
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,520
less ways to screw it up that way so a

1009
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,400
lot of praise for that um

1010
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,040
i appreciated that you

1011
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,280
one put um you know who your audience

1012
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,400
was for but then

1013
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
uh further on you kind of said you know

1014
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,720
if you think this is too newb

1015
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,800
go try this right which i think is

1016
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,880
important um

1017
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,760
definitely right like it's never

1018
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,920
too you're never too advanced to like go

1019
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,000
back to the basics and

1020
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
yeah i think that kind of i mean so it

1021
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
wouldn't be a complete conference if

1022
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,400
nobody said imposter syndrome right it's

1023
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,200
just that you know okay i did it but you

1024
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,119
know it's it's little piddly stupid

1025
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,520
stuff like nobody wants to learn this um

1026
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,440
so it's really cool to see that people

1027
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
do and then you throw those disclaimers

1028
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,960
in where you know you're sitting with

1029
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,000
the bigwigs in here doing a talk about

1030
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,680
crazy stuff over in the other channel

1031
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,960
and um

1032
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,119
but and so yeah he knows all this stuff

1033
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,920
but um not everybody does so it's really

1034
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,680
cool to

1035
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,480
be able to be here

1036
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,119
