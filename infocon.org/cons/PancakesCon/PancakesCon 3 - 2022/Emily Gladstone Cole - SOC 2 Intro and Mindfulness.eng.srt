the obligatory bio slide um i've worn a

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,399
lot of hats over my career i started out

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,559
as unix sysadmin after i got a degree in

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,480
french and genetics

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,239
and i've supported a bunch of different

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,359
unix variants and linux and freebsd

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,080
and then i spent some time doing

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,400
operations incidents and then i jumped

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,880
over to security incident response

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,760
and i've also done security research and

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,000
a bunch of security engineering

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,439
um i've worked with a few companies

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,400
that as they're preparing for soc2 and i

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,640
have opinions about how many companies

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,040
do suck too

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,080
real quick

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,920
promo before i forget if you're a woman

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,520

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,600
free training the next sans academy for

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,640

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,799
sans classes which are otherwise

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,320
extremely expensive

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,000
um i don't get any kickbacks for

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,759
mentioning this but it's been a great

46
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,920
opportunity for a bunch of people so

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,799
think about it check it out maybe um

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,560
i do love cats

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,399
i'm only going to show one slide of my

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,640
cat um this guy

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,719
this adorable nuisance will be 20 years

52
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,520
old next month uh he he wants attention

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,399
when he wants it often at 4am

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,960
uh sometimes when i'm leaving a meeting

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,440
and sharing slides uh i hope he won't do

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,680
that today i kind of left him put down

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,160
for his afternoon nap but um

58
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,680
fingers crossed

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,280
uh the pancakes um my personal pancake

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,680
preference is potato lucky's

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,480
and i do prefer them with applesauce but

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,440
hey

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,200
if you like sour cream instead

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,760
that's just fine too

65
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,440
um

66
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,360
so on with it

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,920
sock 2 and i realized that i defined

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,200
sock 2

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,680
on the next slide

70
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,400
system and organization controls

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,680
um

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,599
it used to be

73
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,480
service organization controls so before

74
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,879
before we get too far into um

75
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,200
security operations um it's

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,080
it's a tool for the sales team to use to

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,239
sell your company's product it doesn't

78
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,879
require extensive security efforts but

79
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,879
it is an easy way for companies to say

80
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,879
that they will do at least a minimum to

81
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,879
secure themselves and protect their

82
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,640
customers data which is really important

83
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,319
to sales

84
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,560
um it also does have a reputation of

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,480
being kind of a starter cert

86
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,720
the requirements are much less strict

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,959
than fedramp and if you're not handling

88
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,560
sensitive data like credit cards or

89
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,159
health information and if you don't have

90
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,159
to you can stay away from the more

91
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,599
demanding certs

92
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,760
just stick with sock too

93
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,400
i'm not altogether convinced that

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,239
people pay a lot of attention to what's

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,879
in the sock 2 reports but really it's

96
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,920
good for your sales team to have one and

97
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,040
uh as a former current security engineer

98
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,640
it cuts down a lot on the number of

99
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,720
security questionnaires that i have to

100
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,799
put time and into

101
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,799
working on and that is a huge huge plus

102
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,680
so okay as we said yes uh system and

103
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,879
organization controls um

104
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,519
it comes from an auditing organization

105
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,319
um auditors and cpas are the ones who

106
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,000
put together this standard and they will

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,439
be the ones who are going to work with

108
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,519
you to issue your report

109
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,519
um saktu is about

110
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,360
complying with the auditors and what

111
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,720
they want to see

112
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,279
rather than necessarily demonstrating a

113
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,440
strong degree of security in your

114
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,478
systems

115
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,320
um just a note

116
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,759
talk one

117
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,639
is all about the finances sock 2 is what

118
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,000
we're talking about this is why it's

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,720
stock 2 um is about the security there

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
is also a stock 3 but

121
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,800
i've never heard anybody actually care

122
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,720
about what that does so

123
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,000
we're skipping that um last point stock

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
2 it really is about compliance it's not

125
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,040
about bringing this brand new security

126
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,639
stuff into your organization

127
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,400
some key vocabulary

128
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,919
um

129
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,880
did i just skip no i didn't okay uh so

130
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,199
trust services criteria

131
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,000
uh these this is formerly called trust

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,560
principles uh these are the five areas

133
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,240
you can get certified in

134
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,199
i'll get more into that in a bit um

135
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,440
policies you definitely need to have

136
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,919
some some policies that define how your

137
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,000
company does at least some amount of

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,039
basic

139
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,759
security and compliance tasks

140
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,919
um they don't have to be very specific

141
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,120
these policies on control items are

142
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,880
individual things that you have to

143
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,479
complete in order to meet those trust

144
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,160
services criteria

145
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,199
um

146
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,080
so

147
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,600
for sock 2 here sock 2 type 1

148
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,759
is a report of how your company's

149
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,720
security is at a specific point in time

150
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,720
a type 2 report is yeah we know how it's

151
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,280
you say it's done at a point in time

152
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,000
it's also true over a monitoring period

153
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,800
a control period where we've audited

154
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,280
your your company's actions your auditor

155
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,680
as i'm getting there you have to have

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,479
one

157
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,360
it's a cpa it's not a security person so

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,840
they're not going to be getting into

159
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,880
oh well you have to use this algorithm

160
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,960
to secure your

161
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
you know if that's available

162
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
in your code you have to use these on

163
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,720
your website

164
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,479
you uh

165
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,759
you're not going to be getting into

166
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,840
detailed security discussions with them

167
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,080
so these trust services criteria as i

168
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,479
said trust principles

169
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,160
each of these criteria will add a bunch

170
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,120
of

171
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,479
additional items beyond the security one

172
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,400
it's it's the pillar

173
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,199
here you are always going to do when you

174
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,759
get do your sock 2 certification you are

175
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,120
always going to have

176
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,280
the security requirement it's called the

177
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,039
common criteria

178
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,400
um

179
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,759
and security is mostly about

180
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,400
access control that pillar controlling

181
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,639
access to information how do people get

182
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,400
access to your

183
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,560
production environment et cetera et

184
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,680
cetera

185
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,440
there are some other things um

186
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,960
availability

187
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,759
it's

188
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,680
kind of like it says on the tin

189
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,919
are the systems available how do you

190
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,759
monitor for uptime

191
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,080
um processing integrity this is uh how

192
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,479
do you confirm that what you've done

193
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,720
is uh is complete

194
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,560
that you know that you haven't had any

195
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,960
errors slip in in the processing of

196
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,599
whatever data you take in

197
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,000
and make sure that it's done in a timely

198
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,039
manner

199
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,280
um confidentiality

200
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,639
different from privacy

201
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,840
confidentiality is about

202
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,919
protecting the information that you take

203
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,840
in the information that your customers

204
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,440
give you or the information that you get

205
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,240
from

206
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,360
uh processing whatever your data is

207
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
privacy on the other hand is much more

208
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,479
stringent

209
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,560
um it's about

210
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
how you handle personal information that

211
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,720
comes in

212
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,800
strongly recommend you don't

213
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,360
get into the privacy stuff unless you

214
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,520
have a privacy officer and you're going

215
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,759
to get really serious about

216
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,360
customer privacy and data privacy

217
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,160
so it's uh

218
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,000
keep that in mind as i said each one of

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,479
these will add a certain number of

220
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,240
additional control items that you need

221
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,319
to demonstrate that you can do

222
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,360
um when you're going through with your

223
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,840
um

224
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,160
with your auditor

225
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,479
all right so the tldr version um

226
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,279
this is the the quick and easy it's not

227
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,000
it doesn't have to be that complicated

228
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,919
um not saying that any of these

229
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,560
individual steps are necessarily simple

230
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,200
but the the formal that

231
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,720
what it boils down to is you have to

232
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
pick what trust services criteria you're

233
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,839
gonna do

234
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,200
um

235
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,600
start with security if you don't need to

236
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,560
demonstrate any of the others um

237
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,880
do all the things that are required in

238
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,640
uh the various control items for that uh

239
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,040
that those criteria

240
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,440
um and then write your your policies and

241
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,519
processes that match what you do once

242
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,680
again they don't need to be super super

243
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,160
detailed you just need to be able to

244
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,000
show that what you're doing matches what

245
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,440
your policy says

246
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,880
you pick your auditor and then the audit

247
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,000
woohoo

248
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,399
um there are some tools that you can't

249
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,839
oh right sorry wrong transition um so

250
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,600
soft2 is about compliance and not

251
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,120
security but

252
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,800
you can get some security in there um

253
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,440
aside from cutting down on those

254
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
horrible security questionnaires which

255
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,720
would be an entire talk in and of

256
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,240
themselves there are a bunch of other

257
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,279
benefits

258
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,480
um

259
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,000
as a security person i'd rather not

260
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,440
spend a lot of time making sure that

261
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,600
johnny has access to the marketing drive

262
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,160
or that jane has access to github and i

263
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,360
don't want to spend a lot of time

264
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,600
proving to my auditors so

265
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,440
things that you can do that are good for

266
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,040
security that are also really good for

267
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,360
the sock too is get yourself set up with

268
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,600
single sign-on um

269
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,120
pick a vendor

270
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,200
integrate them in with everything then

271
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,040
you've got onboarding and off-boarding

272
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
at the push of a button and you can

273
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,640
prove that you do it

274
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,120
and that's really gonna make

275
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,600
everybody happy at the company

276
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,120
um centralized logging you're gonna need

277
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,959
if you're gonna be doing security you're

278
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,640
certainly gonna need

279
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,240
logs you're gonna need to examine them

280
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,839
you're gonna need to build alerts based

281
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,279
on them

282
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,839
set something up it can be a service you

283
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,680
can do it homegrown i strongly recommend

284
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,519
picking a service rather than doing it

285
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,480
yourself

286
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,040
um and then the final final thing that's

287
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,519
really good security um

288
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,800
doing some things to protect your

289
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,440
production environment um

290
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,320
change management setting up protections

291
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,240
around pushing code it doesn't need to

292
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,279
be

293
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,920
a huge thing but if you are

294
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,440
doing reviews

295
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,560
on the code that runs your product um

296
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,480
including you know if you use terraform

297
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,760
or something like that to control your

298
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,040
infrastructure

299
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
um you're in good shape and you've got

300
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
your access control set up with your

301
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,279
single sign on

302
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,079
so

303
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,560
there is some additional automation that

304
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,279
you can do um

305
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,480
that you can um you can add an

306
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,360
additional tool or vendor if you want to

307
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,839
that will help you collect the evidence

308
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,519
and um

309
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,000
we'll work with your auditing firm and

310
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,839
we'll track your progress

311
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,000
um

312
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,519
these

313
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,079
um they'll all give you some sample

314
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,440
policies and they'll integrate into your

315
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,399
um

316
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,320
your various kinds of tools like your

317
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,920
cloud provider your source control your

318
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,200
ci cd

319
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,720
um and maybe even to your hr system your

320
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,000
document wherever you all process docs

321
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,519
um and it's it is much nicer especially

322
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,880
if you're trying to run as a very small

323
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,839
team very a lot nicer to run using one

324
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,279
of these tools

325
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,480
um

326
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,279
rather than trying to run around after

327
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,440
your assisted men and i.t people and

328
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,200
make them gather you all the screenshots

329
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,360
or having your auditor run around after

330
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,160
the

331
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,320
them um

332
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,480
so one note of caution about these um

333
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,120
these are all ones that people have

334
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,680
given me positive uh feedback on just

335
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,000
fyi there are a bunch of others and they

336
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,320
may not work for you but um these are

337
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,399
the ones that i would try to recommend

338
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,160
however if you're going to use one of

339
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,920
these i strongly recommend that you

340
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,880
either

341
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,760
choose an auditor that already has

342
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,519
capabilities with the tool that you've

343
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,720
bought

344
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,680
or

345
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,000
um you go with the tool vendor's

346
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,160
recommended list of auditors because

347
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,800
they will also have

348
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,399
lists of people that they know of who

349
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,399
are competent with that tool suite

350
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,000
so um

351
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,200
i have i have opinions as i said at the

352
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,839
beginning of the talk uh sorry about the

353
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,560
wall of text slide um

354
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,560
so

355
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,279
i don't try to use the sock to

356
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,720
compliance process to build your

357
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
security program

358
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,079
it's not what it's for it's it's

359
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,160
compliance it's not security there are a

360
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,440
lot of things that you're going to want

361
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,760
to do as part of a security program

362
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,560
that sock 2 doesn't care about

363
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,680
they're not the same

364
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,720
make sure that your executives

365
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,079
understand

366
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,440
what they're doing

367
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,079
when they're saying hey i need sock too

368
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,320
um they may not understand that it's

369
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,360
gonna impose constraints on processes

370
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,120
or that it's gonna require that people

371
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,560
define processes um that's not there yet

372
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,399
um

373
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,240
and just one one warning sign if any of

374
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,000
the executives at

375
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
your company say hey i don't want to

376
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
learn about security

377
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,880
that's a really bad sign um

378
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,839
it's a really really really bad sign um

379
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,240
all of the executives do need to

380
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,920
understand the security requirements

381
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,199
there are some

382
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,120
some compliance points that say that

383
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,440
they do um and if they don't want to

384
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,600
you're in for a world of hurt

385
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,000
as i said earlier start with only the

386
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,519
common criteria

387
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,760
which is security for your first year

388
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,199
you can

389
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,519
add additional things in later years if

390
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,040
you want to

391
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,880
but it's really hard once you've told

392
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,480
your auditor that you want to do all

393
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,920
these things it's really hard to take

394
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,440
some of them back

395
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,519
they don't want you to say oh no well

396
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,000
we're not doing that um among other

397
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
things they may be billing you for all

398
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,120
of those things and they don't want to

399
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,800
get into those discussions but um

400
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,040
just start with the process first of hey

401
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,399
we're gonna get a compliance

402
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,760
certification

403
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,440
then you can start getting fancy in

404
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,639
later years um my final point um there's

405
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,560
been a lot of talk about

406
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,079
hey tonya just gave a talk about

407
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,399
security champions making friends with

408
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,480
people in other parts of the org it's

409
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,079
essential um

410
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,720
for the compliance parts as i said you

411
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
if you don't use one of those tools you

412
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,000
really need to make friends with your

413
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,800
sre and infrastructure and i.t teams

414
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,720
in order to get the evidence that you

415
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,600
need

416
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,040
to uh

417
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,199
to

418
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,800
prove your auditor that you're doing

419
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,600
what you're doing okay

420
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,959
so

421
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,839
mindfulness transition time

422
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,399
tea time

423
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,839
all right my goal here in the second

424
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,399
part of this talk is to talk a bit about

425
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,240
what mindfulness is

426
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,800
and isn't and give you a brief

427
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,720
introduction to a couple of exercises

428
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,759
that will

429
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,680
that have helped me that i hope will

430
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,399
help you relax your body and mind and

431
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,680
learn a little bit about where your

432
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,560
tents

433
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,920
um mindfulness has its roots in hinduism

434
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,120
and buddhism

435
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,920
which i am not an expert in

436
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,079
um people have been using it in that

437
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,480
context for thousands of years

438
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,639
and i to explain

439
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,399
all of that rich history would take all

440
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,720
of my time today so i strongly recommend

441
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,480
if you're interested in learning more

442
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,560
about the groundings of it to take some

443
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,360
time and do a bit of reading um

444
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,920
the european approach to mindfulness

445
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,240
which is how i personally encountered it

446
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,639
is not based in religion for the most

447
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,519
part

448
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,519
although uh european and american

449
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,920
practitioners of buddhism um especially

450
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,279
zen buddhism

451
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,600
led the popularization of mindfulness in

452
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,959
that secular

453
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,959
context

454
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
um okay so what mindfulness isn't

455
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,320
um

456
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,800
real talk existing in the world right

457
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,120
now can be pretty stressful uh between

458
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,959
racism climate change parking in the

459
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,959
city and that whole pandemic thing there

460
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,839
is a lot going on um being more mindful

461
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,240
isn't actually gonna

462
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,560
help with any of these major systemic

463
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,680
issues

464
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,680
uh or those big problems but it can help

465
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,440
you deal with the tension that's caused

466
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,079
by those problems uh i put up a quote

467
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,000
from reagan chastain

468
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,880
uh who has an a lot of amazing things to

469
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,119
say about body positivity

470
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,039
um and it's just it's

471
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,280
you know be aware of its limitations

472
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,480
it's not

473
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,640
it's not a perfect tool that will make

474
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,199
everything better for you but it will

475
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,319
it'll help

476
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,160
well it helps me

477
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,119
um

478
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,080
so mind what mindfulness is the basic

479
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,280
human ability to be fully present

480
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,960
aware of what we are

481
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
where we are and what we're doing and

482
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,240
not overly reactive or overwhelmed by

483
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,039
those major systemic issues um so

484
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,160
infosec

485
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,640
it's mostly about thinking right we go

486
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,960
along typing looking at screens mostly

487
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,120
we're sitting at our desks uh it can be

488
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,640
easy if you don't do something to bring

489
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,559
your awareness back to lose track of

490
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,240
what your body is saying

491
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,200
simple things like i'm hungry maybe i

492
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,120
should stretch my back it's getting a

493
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,799
bit sore um mindfulness can help you be

494
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,559
more aware of your body can also give

495
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,520
you some clues to your emotional state

496
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,880
it is often linked to meditation

497
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,160
and it's the first step towards

498
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,360
aquaman's

499
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,120
that's the wrong talk sorry

500
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,039
um body awareness

501
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,480
if you're hungry

502
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,559
eating instead of having stressful

503
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,880
conversation is probably going to be a

504
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,960
better choice but you need to know when

505
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,799
you're hungry being more mindful can

506
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,679
help you with that so um to start with

507
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,280
i'm just going to start with a couple of

508
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,320
exercises that help me relax

509
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,200
first my muscles and then my brain

510
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,919
so

511
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,840
shoulder tension and relaxing i

512
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,520
sometimes find that after a

513
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,840
particularly stressful meeting

514
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,080
like when the head of sales says what do

515
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,760
you mean we have

516
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,440
50 things that we need to do to get to

517
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,840
sac2 they're all important do them all

518
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,880
right now

519
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,640
my shoulders have tensed up and they're

520
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,640
higher than normal um

521
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,200
this exercise works great to uh undo

522
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
that tension so

523
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,760
first step start with your shoulders in

524
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,400
a

525
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,240
neutral position aka down not up raise

526
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,559
them up ah towards your ears as high as

527
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,240
you can

528
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,840
hold them there

529
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,400
for about five seconds

530
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,559
and then uh lower them down back to

531
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,240
neutral um

532
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
and i think if you if you were seeing

533
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,919
how high my shoulders were i think i

534
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,360
actually got them a little bit lower

535
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,000
than they were when i started um

536
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,640
you might find that your new neutral is

537
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,240
a little bit lower and your shoulders

538
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,559
feel less tight after you do this i

539
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,880
advise you do it a few times um and if

540
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,520
so great job

541
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,720
um so some breathing

542
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,120
if you ever done breathing exercises or

543
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,919
just step back take in a deep breath

544
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,039
you may know that it helps you do a

545
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,480
quick reset of your physical and maybe

546
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,160
emotional state so

547
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,720
you breathe in

548
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,960
five seconds optionally you hold it for

549
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,520
a bit breathe out for 10 seconds just do

550
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,760
that a few times

551
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,039
and it helps

552
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,760
helps calm it helps you reset

553
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,280
um

554
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,960
some people have mantras that they like

555
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,559
to say when they're breathing in and

556
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,720
they're breathing out um i personally

557
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,400
don't i just

558
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,520
like to

559
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,240
feel the air coming into my lungs

560
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,400
and then feel it all flowing out of my

561
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,760
body

562
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,520
that works really well for me

563
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,240
this this next one uh from the body i'd

564
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,520
like to

565
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,159
transition to talking about uh calming

566
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,840
and relaxing the mind

567
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,080
now like all of these your mileage may

568
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,480
vary it may not work for you

569
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,760
i know these things don't work for

570
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,600
everybody but you won't know until you

571
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,039
try it right

572
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,039
uh this is a visualization that i do

573
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,880
when i want to stop myself from thinking

574
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
about something or worrying about

575
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,440
something

576
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,080
uh the goal for me is not to forcibly

577
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
stop myself from thinking about the

578
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,200
thing

579
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,440
but to add peaceful thoughts and focus

580
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,200
on them until they are the only thoughts

581
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,799
in my head

582
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,400
so first

583
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,159
you need to identify a peaceful place

584
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,799
maybe it's somewhere out in nature maybe

585
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,360
it's a room in the house you've lived in

586
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,720
or visited

587
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,120
maybe it doesn't actually exist

588
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,440
but it's your definition of peaceful

589
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,200
is it a field

590
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,559
a forest

591
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,240
a hillside

592
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,520
near a lake

593
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,280
near the ocean

594
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,640
uh your grandma's kitchen whatever it is

595
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
once you've identified it you look at

596
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,159
what's there

597
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,000
what's the light level

598
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,320
what can you see

599
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,679
next

600
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,799
listen

601
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,559
to what's around you

602
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,480
are there background noises

603
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,960
like trees moving in the breeze

604
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,840
or the sound of waves

605
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,559
or maybe birds chirping or your cat

606
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,720
purring and now uh feel what's around

607
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,520
you

608
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,039
are you standing are you sitting

609
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,799
is there a breeze

610
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,720
and you feel it on your skin

611
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,039
can you smell anything like flowers or

612
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,559
your favorite tea

613
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,679
or the smell of an old book

614
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,840
once you've got that place

615
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,000
in your mind you just sit there for a

616
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,240
little while

617
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,200
and

618
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,880
breathe it in feel what's there

619
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,159
and then

620
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,559
you slowly come back to where you are

621
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,000
right now

622
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,120
and you can

623
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,039
see what you're seeing now you can look

624
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,480
around you

625
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,120
you can hear whatever's there

626
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,000
and you can feel whatever you're feeling

627
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,240
um once you've found that place in your

628
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,120
head

629
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,360
you can go back there

630
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,520
and experience what being there feels

631
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,960
like in that peaceful place

632
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,440
i i really enjoy doing that

633
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,640
um

634
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,880
you can choose to explore a different

635
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,200
place if you want to the next time um

636
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,679
but that may not work for you and that's

637
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,919
perfectly reasonable if so hey there are

638
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,679
lots of other exercises that you can try

639
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,120
um

640
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,200
the next one that i want to talk about

641
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,919
is uh retention and then relaxation

642
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,320
for me it works best when i start in a

643
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,919
comfortable sitting position with my

644
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,159
feet flat on the floor

645
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,440
um

646
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,679
and yeah really feet flat on the floor

647
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,360
really does help

648
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,320
with feeling grounded um sometimes i'll

649
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,720
do it as i'm lying in bed

650
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,039
and that also works if you're like me

651
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,640
and you have some trouble with insomnia

652
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,240
sometimes

653
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,400
and what you do is first you focus on

654
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,440
your feet

655
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,600
and you tense them up

656
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,840
hard as you can

657
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
you hold

658
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,600
it you get them tenser if you can

659
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,279
and then

660
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,360
you relax your feet maybe you wiggle

661
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,679
your ankles or something the next is

662
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,039
your calves

663
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,880
you tighten your calves up you try to

664
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,159
tighten every single muscle there

665
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,799
you can tighten tight and tighten

666
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,120
you hold it

667
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,840
and then you relax all of those muscles

668
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,080
and then the next thing that you do is

669
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,679
you tighten up your thighs and your butt

670
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:21,950
and

671
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,120
[Music]

672
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,080
you um you squeeze that tight

673
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,640
as you can

674
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,400
maybe tighter

675
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,000
make sure all those muscle groups are

676
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,520
tight

677
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,480
and then you relax

678
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,200
and next up is your torso

679
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,240
um

680
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,000
see if you can tighten i can't really do

681
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,559
this and talk very well but getting all

682
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,039
those muscles tighten your core if you

683
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,559
work out you know it'll tell you about

684
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,200
your core a lot in your core

685
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,559
and then

686
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,120
once you loosen that up okay

687
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,960
you just move on to your hands which are

688
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,400
sitting in a comfortable resting

689
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,960
position right tighten up your hands and

690
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,840
forearms make a fist squeeze really

691
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,158
tight

692
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,000
and then you loosen that up

693
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,360
next your upper arms and your shoulders

694
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,279
maybe maybe you want to put them up

695
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,200
towards your head i don't know whatever

696
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,799
is tight tension there

697
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,840
hold it hold it hold it and release it

698
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,559
and finally your neck and head

699
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,360
which is hard to demonstrate again and

700
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,480
talk

701
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,679
but you hold

702
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,840
you hold your neck muscles tight

703
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,720
maybe you're making a horrible face

704
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
however that works for you

705
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,279
and then you release it okay now

706
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,720
now you're done with all of that and you

707
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,559
shake out your body

708
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,760
and feel the lack of tension

709
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,640
feels really good

710
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,200
and uh

711
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
some notes around that i try to do these

712
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,919
things a couple times a day

713
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,080
and or before i go into a really

714
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,559
stressful meeting or after

715
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,640
and they do seem to help

716
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,679
some other ideas for relaxing

717
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,919
these are kind of guided meditations

718
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,120
that i just went through with you

719
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,600
although now that i've talked about them

720
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,039
you can do them without someone giving

721
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,559
you directions

722
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,120
um if those don't work for you

723
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,880
some other ways that

724
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,039
i've found that are fun to clear your

725
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,880
mind our

726
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,159
webcams the monterey bay aquarium i love

727
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,200
all of their live cams my favorite is

728
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,520
the jellies the otters are also really

729
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,640
wonderful

730
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,760
um

731
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,120
but if you like the idea of someone

732
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,360
guiding you through meditations there

733
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,320
are a whole mess of them on youtube

734
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,240
including ones with profanity if that's

735
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,880
what you if that's what works for you

736
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,760
um

737
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,559
mostly it just makes me giggle though um

738
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,039
which is not exactly what we're going

739
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,000
for

740
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,279
um

741
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,360
side note if you've heard samuel l

742
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,440
jackson reading the book go the to

743
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,919
sleep that is another kind of guided

744
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,200
meditation

745
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,520
um also of course there is an app for

746
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,480
that

747
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,279
the calm app is good for

748
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,720
helping you

749
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,240
learn about meditation and guiding you

750
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,640
through them

751
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,039
so

752
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,799
all right now that we've gone over some

753
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,640
of the techniques for relaxing your body

754
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,320
and mind there are some other things

755
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,760
that you can do with the increased

756
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,880
attention to and awareness of your body

757
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,120
um when your body is stressed

758
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,320
your muscle muscles will tend to tense

759
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,120
up it's a physiological reaction um

760
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,200
muscle muscle tension

761
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,679
is a reflex reaction to stress

762
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,840
both physical and emotional

763
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,679
it's essentially the weight body's way

764
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,320
of guarding against injury and pain

765
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
unfortunately

766
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,880
it doesn't work as well as it did when

767
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,559
that

768
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,279
reflex was developed

769
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,399
so

770
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,320
time to think about maybe revisiting

771
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,640
whether that's important or not so

772
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,399
if you notice that your shoulders do

773
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,840
tend to tense up after stressful

774
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,960
meetings

775
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,480
maybe that's where you carry your

776
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
frustration and anger

777
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,760
um

778
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,960
i notice when i'm getting really anxious

779
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,399
i feel it

780
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,320
behind my sternum

781
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,399
so if i start

782
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,399
um i then start turning it around do

783
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,720
thinking about it from the other side

784
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,679
oh hey i'm feeling a ball of something

785
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,279
behind my sternum

786
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,440
i'm anxious right now what am i anxious

787
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,799
about or

788
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,320
oh my goodness my shoulders are so tense

789
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,080
um

790
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,679
you might find that you notice this

791
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,520
tension in your body and then you

792
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,080
realize hey i'm i'm under more stress or

793
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,720
strain than i thought i was or i'm

794
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,399
feeling more emotion than i thought i

795
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,360
was

796
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,320
um

797
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,480
and you can translate those physical

798
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,399
sensations like my shoulders to an

799
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,559
awareness that maybe presenting to large

800
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,279
groups stresses you out yes

801
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,760
um or maybe it's defending your ideas

802
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
against potential criticism that causes

803
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,279
the stress

804
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,360
and you can figure that out and you can

805
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,600
try to address the roots of those things

806
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,559
as well

807
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,000
um

808
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,600
if you're not one to be very in touch

809
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,919
with your emotions all the time um

810
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,159
having practiced mindfulness being more

811
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,279
aware of your body's state

812
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,960
you can start paying more attention to

813
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,440
your body and use your body signals help

814
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,799
you figure out what you're feeling as i

815
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,640
was saying with my anxiety if i start

816
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,320
noticing that i realize there's

817
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,240
something i'm nervous about i need to

818
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,320
figure out what it is so that i can help

819
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,000
myself be less nervous

820
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,440
okay so some some closing thoughts

821
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,000
uh if you find yourself in a stressful

822
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,279
situation

823
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,840
um like you've got an executive who

824
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,520
insists on getting sock two in three

825
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,720
months

826
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,399
and expects you to do all the project

827
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,440
management for everyone for sock two

828
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,600
and also keep doing all of the security

829
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,440
things that you need to do to keep the

830
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,600
company safe

831
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,799
mindfulness

832
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,039
is not gonna make that go away but it

833
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,520
can help you keep all that stress from

834
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,760
getting to you too much

835
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,000
it can help you keep you from taking

836
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,880
stress from work into your personal life

837
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,080
which is enormous since we're all in

838
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,960
pandemic mode and many of us are not

839
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,240
able to

840
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,600
physically

841
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,120
disengage from our workplace and go to

842
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,039
our home place as separate things

843
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,640
and it can't save you from burnout um

844
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,559
because you haven't improved the causes

845
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,240
of burnout only your reactions to it

846
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,159
but it can help you figure out where you

847
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,320
are on that path

848
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,960
um and the final note about suck two

849
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,799
remember

850
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,720
it's about giving your sales team a tool

851
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,960
they can use to sell your product and

852
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,519
it's about compliance and not security

853
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,480
but

854
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,240
you if you play your cards right you can

855
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,159
get some security

856
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:02,960
in

857
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,159
uh while you're doing it

858
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,240

from upton tea company i can drop a link

868
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,120
into slack later i am a huge fan of tea

869
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,320
um

870
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,799
i have many many teas

871
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,919

872
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,159
upstairs my tea canisters

873
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,799
i'm a big fan also the zojirushi hot

874
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,039
water boilers so that you will always

875
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,799
have water at the right temperature to

876
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,158
make your next cup of tea

877
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,799
one of the challenges for mindfulness

878
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,039
and i think this is something that i see

879
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,760
more in an industry than than elsewhere

880
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,360
i feel like i'm the only person in our

881
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
space who doesn't have it um a lot of

882
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,080
folks have add or adhd

883
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,080
how do i find my way of exercising

884
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,840
mindfulness right like the second i

885
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,760
start to meditate my mind begins to

886
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,600
wander

887
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,399
um

888
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,639
so

889
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,519
i feel unqualified to speak to that

890
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,039
since it's not something that i

891
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,640
personally deal with

892
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,480
um my

893
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,519
my biggest recommendation is

894
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,679
just try a bunch of things

895
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,480
you you may find that

896
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,000
there's a um there's a

897
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,799
live stream of something that has sound

898
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,039
that has things for you to look at

899
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,840
um that can maybe help

900
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,720
you know

901
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,880
take away some of the oh i need more

902
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,360
stimulation um tickle at the back of

903
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,559
your brain

904
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,320
um

905
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,519
just

906
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,360
i'm

907
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,559
beyond that

908
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,200
i'm gonna need to look into that um it

909
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,799
is a really good question and i'm sorry

910
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,640
i don't have an answer for you right now

911
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,440

more and i will get uh whoever it was

914
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,840

915
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,120
an answer

916

nobody knows everything that's part of

917
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,440
how we keep our own stress in check

918
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,399
right for sure yeah

919
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,559
um on sock to compliance because we are

920
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,200
not talking about the sock i still

921
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,720
apologize for that mix up at the

922
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,760
beginning

923
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,799
um

924
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,279
how did you first get into it

925
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,880
um

926
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,519
well the basically uh

927
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,440
i i was a security engineer and i was um

928
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,679
getting inundated quite honestly with

929
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,679
requests from my sales team and my sales

930
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,240
engineers and they were saying hey i

931
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,480
have these questionnaires i need you to

932
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,159
fill out this

933
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,559
50 100 200

934
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,320
300

935
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,799
item questionnaire

936
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,640
and uh

937
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,760
i was

938
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,279
there was one of me

939
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,919
and it was taking me away from keeping

940
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,600
the company secure

941
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,399
and i i had i sat down with the sales

942
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,639
team and we all said how can we solve

943
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,760
this there's only one of emily

944
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,719
you know

945
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,760
let's let's look at this this compliance

946
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,879
certification and see we get you know as

947
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,280
we are customers of other people they

948
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,079
say hey here's my sock to report

949
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,040
and you go oh okay they've got you know

950
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,719
they've they've

951
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,399
they're at least this high off the bar

952
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,879
right they've they passed that bar now

953
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,480
maybe they maybe we would like them to

954
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,399
be up here but at least we know we know

955
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,520
that they're at a minimum there and so

956
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,159
it it seems like

957
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,440
um

958
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,719
i let the sales team drive that process

959
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,000
um

960
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
because i wanted them to pay for it

961
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,160
and it was just the best way to have

962
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,839
them

963
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,240
them involved to have them have some

964
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,800
ownership of what was going on

965
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,280
and uh they

966
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,240
uh

967
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,720
the company said yeah we we need to do

968
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,160
this to make

969
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,400
make our sales job easier and uh

970
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,520
