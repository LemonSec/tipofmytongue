we have michael taggart and he's gonna

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,520

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,960
to the max adding taiji to your fitness

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,480

to shout out uh first of all leslie for

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,599
putting this together and also for

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,238
sending me to hope a bunch of years ago

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,480
and actually kick-starting the infosec

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,640
portion of my i.t career so thank you

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,719
leslie um

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,120
so i before i was a cyber security

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,600
analyst which is what my current job is

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,879
i was a k-12 educator and technologist

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,360
and i still do teach about infosec on

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,760
twitch which is kind of how i got into

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,199
all of this

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,960
but my day job is a cyber security

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,199
analyst i'm a blue teamer by job

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,000
description but i do use my background

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,399
as a web developer in doing web app pen

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,760
testing which is largely what we're

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
going to be talking about today

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,600
i am also a writer as i said i'm a

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,080
streamer and a martial artist for more

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,600
than half my life which is going to

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,400
factor into the second half of today's

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,640
talk basically i'm an all-around dork

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,000
and if you're interested in checking out

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,759
any of this stuff you can follow me on

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,320
twitch and on twitter at mt taggart

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,799
now we're going to talk about owasp's

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,520
web proxy tool called zed attack proxy

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,920
za proxy or just zap

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,000
now i want to make sure that this is

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,840
clear that this is not going to be like

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,159
an intro to web app pen testing talk we

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,240
are making some assumptions about

44
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,680
experience with html http requests and

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,079
responses and having seen how some of

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,240
these tools work now if you don't have

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,600
that there's still something you can get

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,119
out of this but we are going to make

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,560
some of those assumptions for the

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,960
primary audience of this talk

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,920
now zap is a free and open source web

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,000
proxy it actually comes installed by

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,159
default in kali linux when you when you

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,520
set that up

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,920
and it's an alternative to the pretty

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,600
well known burp suite which is a

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,318
fantastic piece of software but a lot

58
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,560
but burp's really advanced features are

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,000
paid and

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,560
zaps are not i've been using zap for a

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,239
long time now and i've come to actually

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,239
prefer it over burp

63
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,239
it has a lot of powerful automation

64
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,959
reporting and scripting capabilities

65
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,239
but in order to make zap work the best

66
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,879
for you it does take some customization

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,480
and some tweaking and we're going to go

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,080
over some of the things that i do to

69
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,560
successfully use zap in a professional

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,760
capacity

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,200
every day

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,920
without further ado then let's get

73
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,080
zappin

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,519
all right so i'm going to start over

75
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,319
here in my kali linux install you can

76
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,280
see i am in zap right now and today

77
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,000
we're going to be testing the owasp

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,239
juice shop web application we're going

79
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,040
to be trying to find some

80
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,959
vulnerabilities in this

81
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,120
but before we even get to zap i want to

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,599
talk about a good setup for web app pen

83
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,519
testing the way that i do it now

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,200
generally speaking you want to have a

85
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,400
browser that is proxied to your web

86
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,239
proxy so that anything that you navigate

87
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,040
to shows up in the proxy

88
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,239
i use

89
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,200
brave

90
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,360
for my proxying and my web app pen

91
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,800
testing and also pretty much for

92
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
everything else in my browser life the

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,799
reason i use brave is that it's chromium

94
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,799
based so i still have the cool chrome

95
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,239
inspector stuff

96
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,200
but

97
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,159
it makes less noise outbound than does

98
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,920
chrome and so

99
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,159
it reduces what i have to clean up in

100
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,599
order to work with a web proxy

101
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,920
in addition to using brave there are two

102
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,799
must have extensions that i use when i

103
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,080
set up my pen testing profile in brave

104
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,519
and i do separate that from the rest of

105
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,480
my traffic the first one is proxy

106
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,959
switchy omega the name rules so

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,120
obviously that's one reason but it is

108
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,640
just it's an extension that allows me to

109
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,439
configure my browser and not my entire

110
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,400
system to send traffic through my local

111
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,920
proxy

112
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,680
proxy proxy works great too that's

113
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,519
available for chrome as well but before

114
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,959
i knew that i started using this one and

115
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,560
got really comfortable with it and it

116
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,239
works phenomenally so just look for

117
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,798
switchy omega in the chrome web store

118
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,560
the other one that i like to have just

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,639
so i have this information at the ready

120
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,280
is wabalyzer which is going to use the

121
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,199
responses and the information coming

122
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,320
from web content to detect technologies

123
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,440
that are in use in a web app super handy

124
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,759
to have just for some recon so i know

125
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,600
what i'm dealing with whether it's a php

126
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,240
application if it's an iis server versus

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,400
an nginx server or whatever great to

128
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,520
just have that at a glance

129
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,960
so as i said we're going to be testing

130
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,720
the juice shop and you can see here that

131
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,800
i've got my two extensions there's my

132
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,440
switchy omega setup and here is

133
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,800
wapalizer

134
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,199
now wapalizer tells me that this is an

135
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,360
angularjs application and as we'll see

136
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,000
in a minute modern web applications

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
provide some complications for

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
traditional web proxy testing but

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,880
nothing that we can't get around

140
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,520
but before we even do anything in terms

141
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,080
of testing we want to configure zap to

142
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,680
the best of our ability so we're going

143
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,440
to go through some customizations that i

144
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,919
think really work out great

145
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,080
the first thing that we want to do is

146
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,759
set up any of the additional plugins

147
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,160
that we can add on to zap to make it

148
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
even more powerful than it is out of the

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,880
box

150
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,280
zap has a really active and vibrant

151
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,120
add-on marketplace which you can access

152
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
through this multi-colored button right

153
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,160
here

154
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,960
and

155
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,280
some of the must-have plugins that i use

156
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,600
are the community scripts which are

157
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,160
additional script based extensions that

158
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,240
the community has added things like bug

159
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,400
hunting scripts there are even scripts

160
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,479
for specific vulnerabilities so if you

161
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,199
want to set test for like telerik

162
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,199
vulnerabilities or whatever else that's

163
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,960
going to be in there for you lots of

164
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,639
great material in there for you to check

165
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,520
out

166
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,360
uh in order to run community scripts

167
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,000
you're going to need the custom payloads

168
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,960
plugin

169
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
so that comes with the dinner basically

170
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,120
when you install community scripts

171
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,319
and in addition the python scripting

172
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,400
plugin will come with that as well and i

173
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,800
love the python scripting plugin even

174
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,440
though zap is written in java it has the

175
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,160
ability for you to add extensions to it

176
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,039
using a python based api that's pretty

177
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,880
advanced stuff but there are situations

178
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,400
in which you want to do some custom

179
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
things with headers and the python

180
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,080
scripting module makes that really

181
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,560
really really easy

182
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,120
i also have the fuzz db lists installed

183
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,759
and that's just for quick access to easy

184
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,720
testing payloads for fuzzing at a target

185
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,000
you know sending many different

186
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,080
variations of an sql injection attack or

187
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,919
a cross-site scripting payload these are

188
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,759
going to be in here for that it also has

189
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,080
word lists for names and usernames and

190
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,160
even some passwords

191
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,080
and then lastly just because it's super

192
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,440
topical um the host support for

193
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,160
out-of-band testing where you need to

194
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
trigger a response to a third-party

195
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,240
server is available now and that is

196
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,080
particularly useful when you're testing

197
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,479
for log4j

198
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,560
and so in fact if you install the log4j

199
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,280
testing component in zab now it requires

200
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,638
you to use host support

201
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,360
with our plugins out of the way there

202
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,880
are some creature comforts that we want

203
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,120
to set up in just the global config of

204
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,800
zap because out of the box there are

205
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,240
some things that might not make sense

206
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,599
for us

207
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,960
the first thing i want to call attention

208
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,080
to is that every time a request comes in

209
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,840
to zap you can see that i've got this

210
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,680
history down here and it's going to be

211
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,360
showing me the request and the response

212
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,960
in this field

213
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
it's going to try to render the body of

214
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,199
the message but sometimes the body is

215
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,199
gigantic so we're going to start by

216
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,639
going into our global options in the

217
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,039
gear icon here and we're going to go to

218
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,919
our display section

219
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,039
i have the ability to set up the

220
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,720
minimum size that is the cut off or the

221
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,879
automatic rendering of messages and i

222
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,039
like to set that pretty low to like 100

223
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,520
000 bytes because if i need to look at

224
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,400
something i can enable that rendering

225
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,720
but by default turning it off for really

226
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,000
big messages

227
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,160
really speeds zap up

228
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,240
um it is a single threaded application

229
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,039
so you want to be careful about how much

230
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,879
you're making it do with messages that

231
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,400
it's ingesting

232
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,160
so i like to knock that down to around

233
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,080
100 000 bytes

234
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,840
you can play with whatever size works

235
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,039
for you for whatever target you're

236
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,519
working with

237
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,120
global alert filters also super

238
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,399
important now i don't have any set up

239
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,399
here because we wanted to add one live

240
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,440
but

241
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,040
as you can see we have some alerts

242
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,880
coming in from

243
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,959
zap if i look at alerts here i'm getting

244
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,600
alerts on content security policy cross

245
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,399
domain javascript things like that but

246
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,800
zap is applying a severity to them that

247
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,720
i may not agree with or my organization

248
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,040
may not agree with so for my report i

249
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,640
want to make sure that any of my

250
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,519
decision making is reflected in my alert

251
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,720
severities

252
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,279
to do that i'm going to click add and

253
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,080
let's my personal favorite is the click

254
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,560
jacking

255
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,600
um

256
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,440
click jacking vulnerability

257
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,120
now i can't find oh there we go

258
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
anti-click jacking header

259
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,640
in an internal test

260
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,440
this

261
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
is it's by medium by default but an

262
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,959
internal test the anti-click-jacking

263
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,640
header may not be as severe it's

264
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
something to make note of but may not be

265
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,440
as

266
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,839
concerning a risk so i can choose the

267
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,600
anti-click jacking header

268
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,080
alert type and change the new risk level

269
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,040
to low rather than to medium

270
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,480
i can confirm that

271
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,160
and then any time that shows up in my

272
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,399
alerts this filter will be applied now

273
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,640
this is also global across the board not

274
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,600
just for this target

275
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,720
similarly the global exclude urls you

276
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,800
want to use some regular expressions to

277
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,720
set up anything that your browser is

278
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,560
going to make noise with as you can see

279
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,240
i have a regular expression here that's

280
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,800
just knocking off everything going to

281
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
brave.com i'm just excluding that from

282
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,720
the proxy right out the gate i don't

283
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,399
have to worry about it it's not going to

284
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,839
show up in my site's tree here

285
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,560
if you have an alert that you absolutely

286
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,800
want to silence you know that you don't

287
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,680
want it

288
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,079
you can go to passive scan rules and

289
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,800
shut it off so here i've turned off the

290
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,079
timestamp disclosure alert because

291
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,000
it's not helpful to me yes things are

292
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,320
going to have time stamps or things that

293
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,040
look like time stamps but i don't really

294
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,440
care about that so i've turned that off

295
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,600
i don't want to fill my report with

296
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,079
garbage

297
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,240
lastly in customization and i know that

298
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,880
we're going very very quick on this but

299
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,240
i wanted to make sure that we got to the

300
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,160
actual testing here

301
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,079
lastly

302
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,399
zap has built-in spidering and attack

303
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,079
modes you can just tell it to attack a

304
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,040
target

305
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,079
but that's a bad idea you don't want to

306
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,160
send any of these automated tools

307
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,079
blindly at a target you want to be

308
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,399
considerate about what you send it at

309
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,279
and i prefer generally to fuzz something

310
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,079
to attacking and when i attack a target

311
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,000
i'm not doing the entire site at once

312
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,920
i'm picking my end point to send my

313
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,600
payloads to

314
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,680
to make that a little bit easier for me

315
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,160
i'm going to make custom attack policies

316
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,480
that only do one kind of attack at a

317
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,720
time so if i go to my scan policy

318
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,040
manager which is this little eq mixing

319
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,640
button up here

320
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,240
it's also available

321
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,839
in uh analyze and scan policy manager

322
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,360
you can see that i have a couple of

323
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,440
policies already made one for sql

324
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,000
injection one for cross-site scripting

325
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,839
and if i wanted to make a new one what i

326
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,240
would do is i would click that add

327
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,360
name my new policy

328
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,279
and change up my thresholds which is

329
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,800
the

330
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,120
the threshold at which it is going to

331
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,279
alert on something

332
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,600
and if i set it to off

333
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
it won't run the attack

334
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,639
so if i apply off to all

335
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,480
everything is turned off

336
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,800
and then i can pick whatever specific

337
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,200
attacks i want to run against a target

338
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,720
so if i didn't want to run something

339
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,560
like server side inclusion or server

340
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,360
side code injection i can set that to

341
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,360
threshold for medium for alerting and

342
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,040
then if i really wanted to be aggressive

343
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,760
with my attack i can use high on both of

344
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,480
these to use more of the payloads in the

345
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,279
payload database

346
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,560
all right that's it for customization

347
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,240
now we're going to get ready to actually

348
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,519
attack something

349
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,399
um

350
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,959
so we're going after juice shop here and

351
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,040
you can see that i've logged in here if

352
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,760
i reload the page

353
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,560
i will get new data in my history you

354
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,639
can kind of see i've got a local

355
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,079
timestamp that is close to what we're

356
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,360
doing here

357
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,680
all good but in order for me to really

358
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,360
work with this target i have to add it

359
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,959
to a scope

360
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,040
so to do that i'm going to right click

361
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,120
on the site and include in context and

362
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,720
make a new context for this thing

363
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,160
i will name it

364
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,959
juice shop

365
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,120
and i will

366
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,760
give it some information about

367
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,079
what technologies it's using we don't

368
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,920
know what database it's using but

369
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,680
probably not oracle

370
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,279
so in this particular case i'm going to

371
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,560
go for mysql postgres sqlite

372
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,000
and i'm going to uncheck the rest of

373
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,240
this stuff because this changes up the

374
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,320
kinds of attacks that zap will run

375
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
i'm going to re-enable the javascript

376
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,839
language obviously this thing is written

377
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,720
in java so javascript i should say and

378
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,440
so

379
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
that's a good baseline for an app like

380
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,320
this a modern web application

381
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,480
now one thing that we have to do this is

382
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,160
an authenticated test i have an account

383
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,079
on this site one thing that a lot of

384
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,120
testers do is they will elide setting up

385
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,600
authentication with an authenticated

386
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,839
site because it's hard but i'm going to

387
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,839
show you how to do it the right way even

388
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,320
for modern web applications like this so

389
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,399
we're going to close out of the context

390
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,160
here for a second and we're going to go

391
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,160
log in to our application

392
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,079
so i'm going to go log in i've already

393
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,240
created an account to save some time

394
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,880
bob at bob.com i can't be the only one

395
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,399
who uses that as a test email address

396
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,639
super secure password

397
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,079
and i'm logged in

398
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,240
now that login did send

399
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,600
a server an http request to the server

400
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,920
you can see in rest user now there's a

401
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,800
post request that has my data in it and

402
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,160
be aware of that your password is going

403
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,920
to show up right now that i have that

404
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,720
i can go back into my context by double

405
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,680
clicking

406
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,839
going to authentication and setting this

407
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,240
up the right way to tell zap how to

408
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,959
detect whether it is authenticated

409
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,240
and it's going to try to do that

410
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,079
whenever it does any spidering or any

411
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,079
attacking because it wants to make sure

412
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,600
that it's authenticated

413
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,760
so i'm going to go ahead and choose json

414
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,079
based authentication yes it's a login

415
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,440
form but the data sent is json in nature

416
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,279
so we choose that

417
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,600
i have to point this thing to the login

418
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,480
form

419
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,560
or the login post request really so i'm

420
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,000
going to send it to rest

421
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,839
user and then there's that post request

422
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,399
right there after i clicked on select

423
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,399
now that i have this data loaded i can

424
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,320
choose my parameters email looks good

425
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,560
for for username and password is

426
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,000
password

427
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,199
awesome from there i move down to users

428
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,519
and i'm going to add

429
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,800
username

430
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,120
say bob set the right username to the

431
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,320
email

432
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,440
and the right password

433
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,399
okay now the context knows how to

434
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,720
authenticate but can it detect whether

435
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,880
we are authenticated the way to know

436
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,040
that is by checking http sessions and

437
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,880
let's remove this

438
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,399
and see

439
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,519
if it can

440
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,880
so we're going to reload the page

441
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,839
and see if it picks up the session okay

442
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,320
it does phenomenal the reason it's doing

443
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,519
that is because in our config our global

444
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,160
config for http sessions

445
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,880
you'll see that one of the options is

446
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,360
for looking for tokens now if you're not

447
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,600
picking up uh

448
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,680
http sessions one of the things you want

449
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,240
to check for is whether the specific

450
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,199
cookie

451
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,639
that your

452
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,440
application is using

453
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,680
or tracking your session

454
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,920
if that key value is available to you

455
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,720
and if it isn't go ahead and add it so

456
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,639
just for sanity i'm going to add token

457
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,680
in here

458
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,720
and that guarantees

459
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,560
that the http session is getting tracked

460
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,639
and that's what it will update when it

461
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,160
needs to

462
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,040
re-authenticate to a site

463
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,920
all right

464
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,079
now let's run some stuff against it when

465
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,319
we want to do some passive scanning we

466
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,319
have two options here the first one is

467
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,079
going to be a spider which is a

468
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,880
traditional spider where you look at the

469
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,280
response from the web server and follow

470
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,720
any links that the html shows you

471
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,640
but we have a problem with a modern web

472
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,919
application with a traditional spider

473
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,240
it'll still do some stuff but look how

474
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,119
small this is it's very very short and

475
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,280
that's because most of the content of

476
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,960
this app is being rendered in the

477
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,440
browser by the javascript so a lot of

478
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,120
the content isn't going to be accessible

479
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,160
to zap in this form so we can run this

480
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,760
passive spider we'll choose our

481
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,880
contextual user that's awesome

482
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,360
but in addition

483
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,600
we're also going to want to run the ajax

484
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,080
spider which is going to use a headless

485
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,640
version of a web browser like firefox to

486
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,760
actually render that javascript and

487
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,440
use that content that document to

488
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,280
follow any links that it finds so i'm

489
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,679
going to again choose juice shop and the

490
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,480
user bob and allow that to run

491
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,320
and already just by doing passive

492
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,080
scanning if we go back to the juice shop

493
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,640
application we should see

494
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,880
some awards getting cleared

495
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,480
if we go to scoreboard at least we

496
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,840
should see some getting cleared

497
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,559
yep

498
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,720
sure enough we have three already

499
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,840
cleared here

500
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,760
now any good test is a mix of automated

501
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,840
and manual testing so i always want to

502
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,600
make sure i'm taking a look at what's

503
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,880
going on inside of the browser history

504
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,280
and the zap history to see what is

505
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,799
possible here

506
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,320
and this is where modern web

507
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,080
applications can get a little tricky

508
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,720
with zap and you do have to still be a

509
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,480
manual we're not we're not going to get

510
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,400
replaced anytime soon by automated

511
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,880
testing and here's one reason why so one

512
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
really quick vulnerability to find here

513
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,960
in juice shop is the search

514
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,120
if i search for test here

515
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,880
you can kind of see that there's a

516
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,200
reflection between what i put in the url

517
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,880
and what shows up here

518
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,600
the problem is you see how this comes

519
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,320
after this hashtag this pound sign

520
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,280
angularjs is handling the routing

521
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,559
for the application the server is not so

522
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,160
all of this is actually happening in the

523
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,480
browser and no additional requests are

524
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
heading back to the web server

525
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,600
so zap can't find this vulnerability for

526
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,160
me i have to find it so if i want to

527
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,320
give it a shot i can go ahead and use an

528
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,000
image test

529
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,840
and sure enough there is reflected

530
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,600
cross-site scripting on this site but

531
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,440
zap wasn't going to be able to find it

532
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,200
you the web app pen tester have to

533
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,840
but something that zap could find

534
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,799
if we're being careful about what we see

535
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,600
is this additional maybe deprecated

536
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,440
request back to search and queue equals

537
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
now this suggests to me that maybe

538
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,200
there's another api endpoint that does

539
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
some searching

540
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,720
and i definitely want to test this out

541
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,679
so the first thing i'm going to do is

542
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,240
i can see that i got a 304 not modified

543
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,320
here which means i got to redirect maybe

544
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,919
but i want to see if it actually works

545
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,559
if i send data to this get parameter of

546
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,159
queue to do that i'm going to right

547
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,080
click on that option or that that

548
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,679
request and open and resend with the

549
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,240
request editor this is like repeater in

550
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,280
burp

551
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,480
and i'm going to set test and go over to

552
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,559
the response tab and hit send

553
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,520
i got a 200 and i got data that rules

554
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,400
okay now that i've done that um what i

555
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,840
want to do now that i've got something

556
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,159
that looks like this my next my next

557
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,120
instinct is definitely sql injection

558
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,919
just to see if i can test for it right

559
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,559
because i got data back in some form

560
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,880
so to do that really easily as i said i

561
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,559
want to run attacks

562
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,720
intelligently i now have a specific

563
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,039
target to run an attack against so what

564
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,960
i'll do is i'll take that new request i

565
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,320
know it's kind of down at the bottom in

566
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,120
the overlay um but i want to take that

567
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,520
test right here i want to right click on

568
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,880
this in the history and go to attack

569
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,760
and active scan which is our active

570
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,480
attack so i'm targeting that endpoint

571
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,159
i'm going to use the sql injection

572
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,919
policy that i've made that just does

573
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,440
that it doesn't throw the kitchen sync

574
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,159
at it just the sql injection attacks

575
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,679
i'll use my correct user

576
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,360
and go to work and let's take a look at

577
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,280
our alerts tab as that happens

578
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,320
right away i get sql injection

579
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,559
vulnerabilities detected super super

580
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,640
handy

581
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,240
and then the last piece i want to show

582
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,600
and then we'll we'll kind of pivot i

583
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,280
know this was fast but it's recorded so

584
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,600
you can go back and look at it again

585
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,000
is how to use fuzzing because fuzzing

586
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,919
and attacking work hand in hand and

587
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,840
generally speaking i want to be doing

588
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,280
more fuzzing than actually attacking

589
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,600
so another thing that i saw when i

590
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,799
logged in was a

591
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,159
basket

592
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,679
so here's a request to rest slash basket

593
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,480
six that six sets off all sorts of

594
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
alarms for me as a web app pen tester

595
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,559
because i want to know okay so i got

596
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,840
data back from it can i access other

597
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,120
baskets

598
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,039
easy enough to test what i'm going to do

599
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,039
is i'm going to highlight the location

600
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,039
that i want to fuzz in this in this

601
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,360
content right click on it and choose

602
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,480
fuzz

603
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,640
this opens up the fuzz dialog again very

604
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
much like burp intruder

605
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,280
and i have a position already set up i'm

606
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,120
gonna go to payloads

607
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,320
add

608
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,120
and numbers from here i'm going to set

609
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,199
up my range let's do just one to 20.

610
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,960
add that payload and start the fuzzer

611
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,400
the fuzzer is going to run really really

612
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,320
quickly and give me data about what came

613
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,480
back again very similar to burp

614
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,400
and you can see that if i'm sorting by

615
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,280
response body which i am i definitely

616
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,000
got access to other people's shopping

617
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,240
baskets i got data back from those

618
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,080
requests

619
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,120
so already definitely getting some great

620
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,200
findings back just by

621
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
setting up zap to work the way that i

622
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,600
want it to

623
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,600
i know that was fast but as i said this

624
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,120
is recorded and i'm trying to make time

625
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,320
for questions at the end

626
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,880
all right with that we're going to pivot

627
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,600
and also calm down a little bit to talk

628
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,520
about taiji twin

629
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,320
also known as tai chi

630
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,400
i have been a martial arts practitioner

631
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,760
and specifically a practitioner of

632
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,679
traditional chinese martial arts for

633
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,720
more than half my life and i love them i

634
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,880
really really believe in their benefits

635
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,600
for people

636
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,480
taiji is a traditional chinese martial

637
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,279
art

638
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,799
and the legend says that it was

639
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,400
based the movements were based on a

640
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,720
fight between a snake and a crane but

641
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,799
the reality is that it was invented

642
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,679
designed as a physical practice and a

643
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,279
martial practice for taoist monks

644
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,400
to produ provide spiritual as well as

645
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,919
physical benefits

646
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,240
it is generally practiced slowly that's

647
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,080
what most people see like in the park

648
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,720
right but not always and i was taught

649
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,120
tai chi as a martial art and some styles

650
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,720
definitely do have

651
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,799
quick movements interspersed with slower

652
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,400
movements

653
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
it can be very very powerful when you

654
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,080
understand how to use it as that but

655
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,679
even if you don't want to do that it is

656
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,559
a fantastic exercise it emphasizes

657
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,799
mindfulness control and balance and i

658
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,240
have to say that when i really get into

659
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,000
the groove when i'm practicing tai chi

660
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,760
the rest of the world does just melt

661
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,200
away it feels fantastic

662
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,840
now these days it's a lot easier to find

663
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,600
people who teach yoga than it is to

664
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,760
teach tai chi and they do have similar

665
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,960
benefits

666
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,200
but there are some important differences

667
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,919
tai chi is not stationary so

668
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,679
if you do some of the traditional forms

669
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,760
the sequences of movements you're going

670
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,440
to need some space but the form that

671
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,600
we've put together for you today

672
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,039
actually you can do just behind your

673
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,880
chair at your desk as long as you have

674
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,360
enough room to sort of expand your arms

675
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,200
out to either side you're going to be

676
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,080
able to do this tai chi form

677
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,159
well tai chi is both martial and

678
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,120
spiritual yoga is not so martial unless

679
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,960
you really read into some of the stuff

680
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,360
in the bhagavad gita but tai chi

681
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,039
absolutely does have martial

682
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,039
applications if you're interested in

683
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,000
finding that meaning in there

684
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,679
tai chi puts a lot more load on the

685
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,600
lower body than it does on the upper

686
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,240
body now in yoga obviously sometimes

687
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,600
you're supporting your body weight with

688
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,919
your arms that's really not true in tai

689
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,760
chi your hands are upright now you still

690
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,120
have to hold your arms out for long

691
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,600
periods of time and in later

692
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,279
forms you will be using you can use

693
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,640
weapons which are heavy so you can get

694
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
some upper body going there

695
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,720
but that is a physical difference

696
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,080
and as i said it's a little bit harder

697
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,159
to find teachers in classes but i will

698
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,480
say that with a little bit of practice

699
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,320
you can definitely get started with tai

700
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,240
chi by just learning from some things

701
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,760
online i really do believe you can get

702
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,240
started that way

703
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,080
okay super embarrassingly uh here is me

704
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,200
doing the yang style 24 step form just

705
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
as a as an example here

706
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,600
so the principles of taiji twin and that

707
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,520
taiji i should say means supreme

708
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,200
ultimate and that icon we saw in the

709
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,440
last slide refers to the supreme

710
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,279
ultimate it's not a brag it refers to

711
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,919
the unification of yin and yang which is

712
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,120
what the practice is supposed to embody

713
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,080
our body is relaxed but it is not limp

714
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,159
our muscles are engaged but only when

715
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,000
they need to be

716
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,400
we're focused on skeletal alignment

717
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
and making sure that movement begins

718
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,000
from the hips

719
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,480
or the core of the body

720
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,880
and in addition

721
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,679
uh

722
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,720
that no one body part moves by itself

723
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,880
everything is coordinated

724
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,520
there is also the principle of balance

725
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,720
meaning that

726
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,400
for everything that goes up something

727
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,720
goes down and you can see that here as

728
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,640
one thing moves forward one thing moves

729
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,720
back one thing goes up one thing goes

730
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,840
down

731
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,960
and again the entire body moves at one

732
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,360
time

733
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,719
it takes a lot of practice

734
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,720
and

735
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,480
even though it seems like there's no

736
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,559
effort going on i have to tell you

737
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,919
that your heart rate's going to go up

738
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,000
when you do this because your quads in

739
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,440
particular are always engaged

740
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,440
all right so i want to go through a

741
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,360
simple eight-step form with you that you

742
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,320
can practice and uh learn some of the

743
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
basic movements of tai chi yourself so

744
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,919
we're gonna cut over to a video here

745
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,279
that we're gonna walk through a couple

746
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,840
of times

747
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,960
okay so we're going to start our

748
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,799
form

749
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,799
standing with our feet together and feel

750
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,159
free to do this behind your chair if you

751
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,240
have the space along all along with us

752
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,640
so go ahead and put your feet together

753
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,080
and to your sides

754
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,799
shoulders relaxed body up straight

755
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,039
we begin by bending our knees slightly

756
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,000
and stepping out to the left this is the

757
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,840
opening of the form

758
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,600
then

759
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,279
once we have stepped out we're going to

760
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,799
raise our hands

761
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,960
to shoulder height and then slightly

762
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,880
sink our weight down as our hands drop

763
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,600
towards our hips

764
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,559
part move number two is called parting

765
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,480
the wild horse's mane and what we're

766
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,840
going to do is we're going to do three

767
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,840
different movements and then alternate

768
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,000
sides so we get balance right we're

769
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,600
doing it on the left then we'll do it on

770
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,720
the right for each of the three

771
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,399
movements so the first movement is

772
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,399
parting the wild horse's mane

773
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,600
we shift our weight over to our left leg

774
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,360
and what you'll see happen is my right

775
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,399
hand comes across my body and comes up

776
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,760
to my left shoulder my left hand at the

777
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,840
same time comes over to my right hip and

778
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,600
there's an alignment between elbow and

779
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,880
finger

780
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,039
i'm like holding a beach ball and i'm

781
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,120
also trying to create a circle or maybe

782
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,520
like a yin yang sort of symbol which is

783
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,799
intentional

784
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,039
my left foot comes into my right and

785
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,600
then i step out with my heel and then i

786
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,799
shift my weight to my left leg as i turn

787
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,399
my body and i know this takes some

788
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,000
practice i'm going to share the link to

789
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,279
this video at the end in the slack

790
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,080
as i shift my weight over my hands

791
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,760
travel past each other almost like

792
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,879
they're crashing symbols

793
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,159
and they end with my left hand out in

794
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,600
front of me kind of like i'm looking at

795
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,039
my phone without reading glasses or

796
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,399
something

797
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,919
directly in front of my chest and my

798
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,600
right hand is out to the side with my

799
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,640
fingers

800
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,559
pointing out to the right

801
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,320
this stance which is going to be our

802
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,080
ending stance for each movement is known

803
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,080
as the bow and arrow stance or the bow

804
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,360
stance here's our bow here's our arrow

805
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
notice that nothing is really locked out

806
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
everything is curved right where you use

807
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,520
arches just like in architecture

808
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,960
sixty percent of my weight is on my

809
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,919
front leg and 40 is on my back

810
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,320
notice that my toe is turned in here

811
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
that happened when i shifted my weight

812
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,880
and my front foot is out like so there's

813
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,640
an alignment between my knee and my toe

814
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,320
it shouldn't go over and it shouldn't be

815
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,440
behind just like this

816
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,760
from here i'm going to shift my weight

817
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,399
over to my right leg to allow my left

818
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,000
foot to turn

819
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,039
and i bring my right foot into my left

820
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,600
and create that beach ball again

821
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,760
again that alignment i step out to the

822
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,360
right same way

823
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,600
and i part the wild horse's mane on the

824
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,720
right

825
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,159
again notice that the toe is kind of

826
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,760
point the left toe is pointed out at a

827
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,320
45 degree angle and my right foot is out

828
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,399
here

829
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,399
i also wanted to note that you have to

830
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,200
have this really nice alignment here

831
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,399
from heel

832
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,399
to heel

833
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,799
if my toe

834
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,360
if my heel is in line with my toe

835
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,120
that's no good because then i'm going to

836
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,279
be a little bit too tight-roped and i

837
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,559
won't have good balance so i want to

838
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,840
make sure that i have

839
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,080
a little bit of separation between

840
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,480
my toe and my back toe and my front heel

841
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,960
from there i'm going to wipe my

842
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,279
right hand across my face

843
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,679
as my left hand comes up

844
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,360
i look back at my left hand as i'm

845
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,320
shifting my weight over to the left

846
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,960
then i wipe the other way as i bring my

847
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,760
leg my weight back over to the right

848
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760
bring the feet together again notice

849
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,480
that my right hand is kind of coming up

850
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
and it curves

851
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,000
as i step out this time i'm stepping out

852
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,480
the same way but this time my hand comes

853
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,760
through

854
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,840
we like to think of it like a crashing

855
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,240
wave

856
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,200
that's brush knee twist step

857
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,360
my left hand is down at my side

858
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,960
i'm facing down

859
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,880
so again i wipe

860
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,320
i wipe again bring the feet in step out

861
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,039
brush d twist step

862
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,039
our last movement is called single whip

863
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,120
and we begin by wiping across again as

864
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,399
we shift our weight

865
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,080
and move our hands back

866
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,840
now this time you can see something kind

867
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,200
of interesting is going on with my right

868
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,240
hand

869
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,519
this is

870
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,760
a crane's beak so i'm taking all of my

871
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,159
fingers and putting them on the thumb

872
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,240
and hooking my wrist

873
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,159
this is where the crane inspiration

874
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,440
really comes from

875
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,600
or it shows itself as i step out this

876
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,480
time my left hand wipes across my body

877
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,320
and then comes out in front just like so

878
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,240
this is single whip and again notice

879
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,200
that i'm in my bow stance

880
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,399
to transition to the final single web

881
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,880
both of my hands drop then my right hand

882
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,440
comes across my left hand comes up i

883
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,600
shift my weight back over to the leg i

884
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,120
stepped out with which is the way we do

885
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,720
this every time

886
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,080
look with my left hand step out

887
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,559
right hand out and we've got that nice l

888
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,720
position between the arms

889
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,399
finally

890
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,080
we move our weight back to center

891
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,240
turning our toe in toward our initial

892
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,399
starting position and our hands sink

893
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,200
down

894
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,600
as we stand up and then we pull our left

895
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,440
foot in reversing the opening

896
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,720
i think we have time to show this one

897
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,760
more time

898
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,120
so let's go ahead and do that

899
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,519
so again we step out

900
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,200
open

901
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,440
we bring our hands up and we slowly sink

902
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,559
down

903
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,080
we shift our weight over to the left and

904
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,600
bring the right hand over

905
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,399
pull the left foot in step out parting

906
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,480
the wild horse's mane

907
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,799
again nice and relaxed

908
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,720
we shift our weight back and pull the

909
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,519
right leg in that was to turn this toe

910
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,200
and we step out

911
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,640
to part the wild horse's mane on the

912
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
right side

913
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,880
then we wipe across our face with both

914
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,919
hands

915
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,840
and then we step out to the left brush

916
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,440
knee twist step our right hand like a

917
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,360
crashing wave

918
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,679
then we wipe the other way again pulling

919
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,320
that leg we just stepped out with in

920
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,600
and stepping out brush knee to a step

921
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,119
and then finally our hand comes out

922
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,040
notice that it's wiping this way rather

923
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,199
than this way

924
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,239
the left

925
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,639
back over to the right and then we hook

926
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,679
our right hand stepping out single whip

927
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,520
both hands drop

928
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,119
we wipe to the right

929
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,119
come over to the left and hook

930
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,960
step out to the right

931
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,040
single whip

932
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,320
then

933
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,879
we close

934
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
as i said i'm going to share the video

935
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,040
uh this video

936
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,520
and a link to another youtuber that i

937
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,440
actually think does a great job doing

938
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,560
tai chi demonstrations if you want to

939
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,359
learn more in the slack after this talk

940
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,079
um we can go through it again or if

941
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,159
there are any questions we're at a good

942
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,719
stopping point

943
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,879
hey uh actually we do have some great

944
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,520
questions both on zap and some taiji uh

945
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,760
i was looking at your very end there and

946
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,119
i was thinking you know watch me small

947
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,760
whip and watch me nae nate

948
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,839
terrible terrible joke

949
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,359
um so yeah uh let's see uh someone did

950
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,079
have a question um that whenever they

951
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,040
use

952
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,359
zap or burp i just go for their bundled

953
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,880
browsers which already have a proxy

954
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,680
configured is that good enough uh so

955
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,160
there's a very there's a reason i don't

956
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,240
do that which is that even their bundled

957
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,920
browsers are still phoning home to

958
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,640
mozilla all the time

959
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,440
which is why i don't like using them

960
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,599
i have more control if i do it by

961
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,480
setting up brave to work this way now it

962
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,800
totally works fine you can absolutely do

963
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,480
that you can launch because what what

964
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
zap can do is launch

965
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,240
um

966
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,680
you know open url and browser it can

967
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,760
launch it in a controlled browser

968
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,079
uh whatever target you have but as i

969
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,960
said it just it has a lot of overhead

970
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,280
and i find that it's because it's

971
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,280
running as a child process i don't know

972
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,359
it's less performant than using uh the

973
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,400
browser independently

974
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,839
very cool and someone noticed that you

975
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,320
turned off brave alerts uh why did you

976
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,680
do that

977
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,839
i turned off brave alerts um

978
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,720
i assume i i think they mean the global

979
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,200
exclude url here

980
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,040
so the reason i did that is because

981
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,599
brave has a syncing component and a few

982
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,240
other things it doesn't phone home uh

983
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,560
not at all it just phones home less than

984
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,680
firefox and chrome vanilla right so i

985
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,000
still want to quiet all of that so i

986
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,440
have excluded brave domains google apis

987
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,480
and gstatic.com from my proxy because

988
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,920
otherwise they're going to keep popping

989
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,760
up in my sites that the proxy is

990
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,440
detecting

991
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,400
got you

992
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
um also a question for the zap part of

993
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,880
the talk can i script zap usage from the

994
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,839
command line like from bash you sure can

995
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,040
um

996
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,119
kind of from bash so the automation

997
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,720
features are really rich there is a

998
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,880
python based api there's also a java

999
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,240
based api

1000
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,400
but in addition to that there it has

1001
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,320
recently been added this automation

1002
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,359
feature which allows you to set up an

1003
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,200
automation plan for the kinds of attacks

1004
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,359
you want to run you can build it out in

1005
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,000
zap and then save it as a yaml file so

1006
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,760
that you can import it or modify it

1007
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,560
however you want um i have done i have

1008
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,280
done web app tests against like entire

1009
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,599
cpanel sites like hundreds of sites and

1010
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,960
i have scripted that all from the

1011
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,160
command line using the python api

1012
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,560
very very cool um someone was remarking

1013
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,280
how how they were having a tough time of

1014
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,200
finding a place to learn tai chi

1015
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,119
uh they were using dvd and some youtube

1016
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,160
videos but they always seem to be

1017
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,680
getting the forms wrong i think you said

1018
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,480
in the

1019
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,680
in either your slides or there's

1020
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,119
something you have some recommended

1021
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,599
resources that do a very good job of

1022
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,240
showing taiji forms yes i do and i'll

1023
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,520
share those uh in slack fantastic and

1024
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,359
then uh can i request edit uh the editor

1025
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,160
wait

1026
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,240
let me read this right can i set the

1027
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,560
request editor window to show request

1028
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,240
and response at the same time instead of

1029
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,480
having to switch between tabs yes you

1030
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,200
can um if we open the resend request

1031
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,119
editor i have a bunch of different view

1032
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,800
modes here where it says here separate

1033
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,560
tabs for requesting response that's the

1034
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,800
way that i like it but i can also set it

1035
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,880
to request shown above response and now

1036
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,079
you can see your request and response in

1037
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,040
one window without switching that's dope

1038
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,079
and then uh it looks like uh johnny from

1039
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,000
the chat also has a last minute question

1040
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,960
here so we can also set up those global

1041
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,440
filters for the bundled browsers

1042
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,839
yes you can the global alert filters are

1043
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,599
going to and don't forget that they're

1044
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,599
persistent across sessions it's not just

1045
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,520
for your specific session but those

1046
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,640
global alert filters are going to change

1047
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,200
for anything that you set up uh anything

1048
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,040
that comes into the proxy so regardless

1049
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,720
of what browser the traffic is coming

1050
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,440
from including if you do it with curl

1051
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,440
and the command line with the proxy

1052
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,920
those those uh alerts will still go

1053
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,000
through and i'll quickly say that one of

1054
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,760
the things i love to do when i'm doing

1055
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,880
api testing is i'll load up the api spec

1056
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,520
in postman right or some other api

1057
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,760
specific testing tool proxy it through

1058
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,359
zap capture the traffic and the

1059
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,280
authentication keys and things like that

1060
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,040
and then use zap to do the fuzzing on

1061
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,520
the actual endpoints so and even there

1062
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,320
the alert filters will apply

1063
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,839
very cool how long have you been doing

1064
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,680
taiji by the way uh oh my god uh uh so

1065
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,160

1066
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,280
wow

1067
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,200
did you have you gone through like many

1068
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,440
schools of tai chi like different actual

1069
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,040
schools and teachers and traditions of

1070
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,440
it or have you stuck with just one uh

1071
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,680
mostly one teacher but yeah there were a

1072
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,599
couple and then kind of learning on my

1073
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,880
own after that and i've done yang and

1074
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,680
sun styles uh of tai chi i did a little

1075
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,720
bit of chen

1076
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,240
and then you know the rest of my

1077
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,599
traditional martial arts experience is

1078
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,320
also chinese martial arts but um

1079
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,040
other other internal arts like uh xingi

1080
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,839
uh bagua and then also northern martial

1081
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,680
arts like uh baji twin

1082
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,839
i got you yeah i have uh chen's book

1083
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,960
over on my bookcase nice i've done very

1084
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,680
cursory i've only done like the first

1085
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,200
maybe 18 of the short form uh in that

1086
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,960
over there so uh

1087
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,720
opened up almost exactly the same that

1088
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,560
you did it and then you are just doing a

1089
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,400
few different moves differently at the

1090
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,560
beginning uh same moves that you do

1091
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,240
later on in the short form that i

1092
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,920
learned but you were doing less it was

1093
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,040
really cool because i was like i

1094
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,400
remember doing that

1095
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,560
sense style is the oldest of the taiji

1096
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,240
styles and yang is the newest um but and

1097
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,480
and kind of like most regulated um but

1098
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,079
it's the one that most people will have

1099
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,280
access to

1100
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,200
