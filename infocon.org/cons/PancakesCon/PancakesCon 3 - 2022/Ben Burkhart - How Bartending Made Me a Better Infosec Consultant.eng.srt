and i've been at black hills for about

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,119
six or so months now um previously

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,160
before that

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,160
i was a senior security engineer at

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,760
evolve security

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,519
which is actually i believe where i met

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,279
angela back in the day the same boot

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,760

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,760
um so some of the cool stuff that i've

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,360
worked on in the past

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,680
i did an apt compromise incident

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,600
response project which was one of the

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,280
first big projects i got thrown on back

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,120
in like 2018

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,879
also known as the most stressful summer

26
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,640
of my entire life definitely do not

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,280
recommend that if you can avoid it

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,640
i've done things like cloud security

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,280
assessments for fortune 25 companies

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,719
i've done a large amount of kind of

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,520
recurial recurring adversarial emulation

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,680
purple team testing for organizations

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,280
which is always a lot of fun

34
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,560
when you have a little bit more of that

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,000
back and forth with the blue team while

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,520
you're doing testing

37
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,520
and just about uh every other kind of

38
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,759
pen test in between so web apps external

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,799
internal

40
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,520
um assume compromise and everything that

41
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,360
those entail

42
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,720
some of the things that i enjoy outside

43
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,960
of security i like iced tea

44
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,880
always have i grew up in north florida

45
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,759
so

46
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,240
sweet tea was was big in my youth um

47
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,759
since then i've moved on to unsweetened

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,920
tea just because it's better for me and

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,119
you know

50
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,119
do what you can i like mechanical

51
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,880
keyboards um like a lot of other people

52
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,640
in tech no surprise there

53
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,040
i like running i hit 500 miles of

54
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,439
jogging last year in 2021 which is a big

55
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,880
goal for me so

56
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,520
shooting for 750 this year

57
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,240
and i like louise this is um

58
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,119
i've recently adopted retired racing

59
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,479
greyhound that my girlfriend and i

60
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,799
adopted last summer so

61
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,640
she's been a a bit of a challenge but

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,159
also the light of our lives for the past

63
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,040
six or so months

64
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,719
um so how did i get here and this is

65
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,160
something that i think is always

66
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,440
interesting

67
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,120
in the field of security everyone kind

68
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,319
of gets here in a weird different

69
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,599
roundabout way

70
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,200
um people like to make analogies about

71
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
kind of the island and misfit toys

72
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,879
and you know it's very true everyone

73
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,959
kind of ends up here in a different way

74
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,959
no one's path is the same and i think

75
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,480
all of those different backgrounds and

76
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,080
paths that kind of lead people to this

77
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,040
field

78
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,120
really help make people in this field

79
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,200
stronger what they do um it provides

80
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,959
like a variety of experiences that help

81
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,879
inform the work that we do and it also

82
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,239
just makes people more well-rounded

83
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,920
employees and individuals things like

84
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,120
that

85
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
so a quick background of how i ended up

86
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,319
here um

87
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,160
i was always a tinkerer when i was a kid

88
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,680
i took things apart put things back

89
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,560
together

90
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,400
i was obsessed with the movie hackers

91
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,560
also like most of us were

92
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,720
my dad was really into computers so i

93
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,640
used to play fisher price games on his

94
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,959
commodore 64 at the office

95
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,599
he brought home an intel i86 back in the

96
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,480
day

97
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,400
so i kind of grew up on on a command

98
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,959
line with ms-dos when i was quite young

99
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,080
so i always knew i wanted to do

100
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,000
something with computers as an adult and

101
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
when i was finishing up high school

102
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,280
which was not a particularly challenging

103
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,319
endeavor

104
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,760
and that's not me bragging in the

105
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,840
slightest

106
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
i decided to study computer sciences so

107
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,640
i applied to and was accepted to the

108
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,159
computer science program at university

109
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,159
of the illinois urbana champaign which

110
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,920
was a pretty challenging program that i

111
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,720
was incredibly not ready for

112
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,319
first semester i was put on academic

113
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,400
probation and the second semester i

114
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,000
failed out of the program

115
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,599
so after that trying to figure out what

116
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,040
else i wanted to do i was also really

117
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,480
into photography

118
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,080
i slammed a little bit but not as much

119
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,760
anymore and i think one of the things

120
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,360
that drew me to photography as well is

121
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,080
it's also a very technically oriented

122
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,760
kind of practice right

123
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,840
as far as all of the fine arts

124
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,840
i would say like av stuff and

125
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
cinematography and things like that are

126
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,159
close but

127
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,640
photography is is very technologically

128
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,239
driven so i was excited to study

129
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,360
something that i could still use a

130
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,879
computer i could still play with fancy

131
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,400
expensive tech you know all that fun

132
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,840
stuff

133
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
so i took some community college classes

134
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
at urbana-champaign

135
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,799
i ended up coming up to the city of

136
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,959
chicago to finish school at columbia

137
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,280
college in about 2007

138
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,439
um and as i was finishing up i was you

139
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,120
know i needed to start making money and

140
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,478
paying rent and doing all those things

141
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,238
that people do and like most people that

142
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,440
i knew from art school i ended up

143
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,840
bartending after that

144
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,560
so my first job at a bar was at a craft

145
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,960
beer and sausage bar in 2010 in wicker

146
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,400
park

147
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,240
and i kind of did that for quite a long

148
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,120
time

149
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,960
i started to get tired of it as i got

150
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,919
older you know i passed the 30-year mark

151
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,240
staying up late wasn't fun

152
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,080
it felt like career progression was

153
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,520
pretty limited you're kind of hopping

154
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,120
from cool bar to cool bar because so

155
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,560
much of your income is

156
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,400
subsidized by tips

157
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,919
so i started looking at you know getting

158
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,000
back into technology um one of my

159
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,840
regulars from from a bar that i worked

160
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,759
at actually works at kenna

161
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,040
and he was the one that introduced me to

162
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
the idea of getting into security

163
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,039
i looked into some some boot camps ended

164
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,560
up deciding on the evolved security boot

165
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,720
camp back in 2017

166
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
and went through the program

167
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,720
so after i finished that program i was

168
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,360
kind of thrown into consulting

169
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,440
at the time evolve was kind of

170
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,479
mostly a boot camp and academy type

171
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,800
organization but security services and

172
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,560
doing actually actual delivery work and

173
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
pen test kind of picked up as time went

174
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,280
on

175
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,800
so i gradually got put on more and more

176
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,639
of those projects

177
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,560
and that was great um it was what i

178
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,120
always wanted to do it was exciting it

179
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,360
was fun it was technically challenging i

180
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,880
feel like i learned in the learn more in

181
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,280
like those first like 30 days on the job

182
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,800
more than i did at any other point kind

183
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,320
of leading up to that

184
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,560
as much as you try to

185
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,639
and you know cool tools cool techniques

186
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,720
a lot of fun but something that really

187
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,360
stuck out to me and i didn't anticipate

188
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,120
or expect but probably should have

189
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,440
realized is how much i was still talking

190
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,199
to people

191
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,319
and

192
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,080
those of you that know me personally i'm

193
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,479
a pretty introverted quiet person

194
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,080
i think i'm okay at talking to people

195
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,680
but it's not something that i actively

196
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,880
choose to do

197
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,400
and i thought that by leaving bars

198
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,759
leaving the service industry and going

199
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,600
to work in tech somewhere you know i

200
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,199
would have to deal with people less you

201
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,319
know it was something that i was excited

202
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,680
about doing because

203
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,440
dealing with people at 4 00 am on a

204
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,280
saturday night at a bar is not an ideal

205
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,560
time to have conversations usually

206
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,919
but once i got into the got into

207
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,120
security i realized i was talking to

208
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
people just as much if not more

209
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,639
i was writing reports i was doing

210
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,919
kick-off calls with clients i was

211
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,919
delivering those reports i was using

212
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,440
soft skills to manage that stuff along

213
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
the way and that was kind of a shocker

214
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
to me so if if there are people that are

215
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,960
interested in getting into consulting

216
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,199
one thing that i would say to you is

217
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,960
don't be surprised that you will need to

218
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,639
end up being very client-facing during

219
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
the majority of your career

220
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,880
so why is this important

221
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
um as i kind of mentioned consulting and

222
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
bartending at the end of the day are

223
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,960
kind of both service industry jobs right

224
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,800
if you work for an msp services in the

225
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,880
name managed service provider

226
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,639
if you do delivery services it's also in

227
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,840
the name

228
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,360
so much like working in the service

229
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,280
industry behind a bar the the clients

230
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,199
that we work for the people who

231
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,960
very much dictate and inform the work

232
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,199
that we do um the deliverables that we

233
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,960
hand over you know the product that we

234
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
sell is very important

235
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,240
so when you're working behind a bar

236
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,400
that's obviously food and drink when

237
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
you're consulting that's some sort of

238
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,840
actionable pen test report or audit

239
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,880
report or something like that they're

240
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,319
going to hand off

241
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,000
but aside from those deliverables the

242
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,160
experience along the way is equally as

243
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,919
important you know both for you and for

244
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,360
the client

245
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,000
um this may seem obvious but recurring

246
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
clients are the best right getting to

247
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,720
know people building those relationships

248
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,919
networking

249
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,880
and just helping an organization

250
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,400
you know if you have an organization

251
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,919
that comes to you and you do a pen test

252
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,120
you know it's their first time ever

253
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,479
doing a pen test

254
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,240
you give them a report they go and fix

255
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,840
those changes you come back and test in

256
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
a year their security maturity level is

257
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,039
so much you know further above and

258
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,479
beyond where it was the first time it's

259
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,160
cool to see clients kind of grow and

260
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,599
build their security maturity out like

261
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,120
that

262
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,280
but also like on a financial and fiscal

263
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,919
level recurring clients are easier and

264
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,199
cheaper than going out and finding new

265
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,800
clients and also they tell their friends

266
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,919
they tell their friends what a great

267
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,440
experience they had with you how

268
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,199
attentive you were what white glove

269
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,720
service they have a quick keyword answer

270
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,960
emails polite understanding all of those

271
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
things all those things go a really long

272
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,840
way

273
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,240
in what is a very small field i've come

274
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,000
to realize

275
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
so all of these things

276
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,800
are quite important you know the

277
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,240
technical stuff is very important too

278
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,840
but all these kind of little unspoken

279
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,479
like soft skills steps of service how we

280
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,479
communicate how we listen all these

281
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,719
things are just as important as well

282
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,760
and i'm sure we've all had bad

283
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,120
experiences on both sides of that

284
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,360
equation right we've all been to a bar

285
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
where we had a terrible experience the

286
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,200
server was on their phone the whole time

287
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,600
your food was late things were wrong you

288
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,519
know things were things were messed up

289
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,279
the people working didn't do a good job

290
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,600
of explaining or managing that to you so

291
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,959
you kind of felt like you got the short

292
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,519
end of the stick um i'm sure we've also

293
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,040
all been on pentest where we've kind of

294
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,640
messed things up and done things that we

295
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,240
wish we would have done better and stuff

296
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,760
like that so i think

297
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,200
being able to take constructive

298
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,560
criticism and feedback from those

299
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,800
situations and learn what we can you

300
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,320
know what we can just to be better from

301
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,640
both sides of that equation is really

302
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,080
important to growing as a consultant

303
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
cool so um

304
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,959
what are the things that oops sorry

305
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,160
one of the things that i like to talk

306
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
about that people kind of don't always

307
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,959
notice when you're going out for dinner

308
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,320
or drinks are

309
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,640
the the two most important points of

310
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
time in my experience and from what i've

311
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,560
seen are kind of when you first walk

312
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,640
into a place and when you leave so kind

313
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
of those bookends of that interaction

314
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,080
like when you walk in the front door how

315
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,160
long is it before someone greets you

316
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,440
you know does it look like you need to

317
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,800
wander around do you have to find your

318
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,880
way to your own table things like that

319
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,800
um so that's very important to kind of

320
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,279
set the tone for the evening right and

321
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,880
in the consulting world

322
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,000
the analogy of that is kind of the

323
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,279
kickoff call obviously there's like

324
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,399
business development calls and

325
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,000
everything that leads up to it but when

326
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
you use a technical resource get on that

327
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,360
first call with the client that's kind

328
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,880
of your first exposure to them your

329
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,160
chance to listen and talk to them and

330
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,720
get to know them and things like that

331
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,160
um the second most important part of

332
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,640
that is kind of the end right so paying

333
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,399
your bill and being thanked as you leave

334
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,680
the space

335
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,279
there's nothing that kind of ruins a

336
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,200
great meal for me more than

337
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,640
finishing your drinks finishing your

338
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,480
food and then not seeing your server or

339
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,320
bartender for 15 or 20 minutes you know

340
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,920
and you're just kind of hanging out you

341
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,120
don't really have anything to eat you

342
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,399
don't have anything left to drink no

343
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,160
one's kind of come and talk to you

344
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,600
by the time you do see them they're like

345
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,519
oh you need the bill and then they have

346
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,120
to go print the bill and then come back

347
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,480
then you give them a card then they go

348
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,320
and come back and that kind of just to

349
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,480
me ruins the experience a little bit so

350
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,839
i've got a little snippet here from the

351
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,440
milk and service or milk and honey

352
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,680
service manual this was a bar from new

353
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,920
york like the late 90s

354
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,440
by my name sasha that kind of set the

355
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
tone for a lot of like high-end cocktail

356
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,360
culture in the late 90s and early 2000s

357
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,880
so it says being aware of body language

358
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,560
and eye movements

359
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,920
it's always better to anticipate the

360
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,360
need for a check and drop it in a manner

361
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,720
that doesn't make the guests feel rushed

362
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,399
rather than to have them have them wait

363
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,240
for the guest to ask for it so i think

364
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,640
anticipating needs um and these kind

365
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,079
these types of interactions is also a

366
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,519
very important thing that we that we can

367
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,720
be better about as consultants

368
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,880
so in that note we'll talk about setting

369
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,800
managing and meeting expectations

370
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,480
ideally exceeding as well if we get

371
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,959
there but um as i mentioned kind of the

372
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,800
bookends like the initial kickoff and

373
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,240
kind of the final

374
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,839
those kind of set the tone for the the

375
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,279
course of the engagement in my opinion

376
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,240
there's a lot of things that can go

377
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,640
wrong in between but if those if those

378
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,480
kickoffs and those kind of finishing

379
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,800
tying off notes go well you can you can

380
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,880
manage everything else in between

381
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,399
um so we're going to talk about like

382
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,480
initial kickoff calls first some service

383
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,839
industry examples of kind of like

384
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,120
reading the room and getting to know

385
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,240
your client

386
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,760
you know if someone comes in on the

387
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
first date you know one person shows up

388
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,279
before the other one they're clearly act

389
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,480
very nervous you know they don't really

390
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,320
know each other how does that inform the

391
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,680
way that you serve them as a bartender

392
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,959
you know maybe you're more energetic

393
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,480
maybe you make it more of an interactive

394
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,600
experience for the both of them you're

395
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
kind of like trying to make them have

396
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,680
help them have fun with one another etc

397
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,200
versus like a solo drinker someone that

398
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,880
comes in by themselves

399
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,480
just as a book you know they kind of

400
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,600
know what they want you don't really

401
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,959
need to spend too much time like

402
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,040
engaging with them they're here to like

403
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,399
get their drink eat their food read

404
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,120
their book hang out and go home etc

405
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,720
so conversely

406
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,079
in the consulting world we need to

407
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,519
figure out what the business drivers are

408
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,200
behind engagement right so when we get

409
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,519
on that first call with a client

410
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,440
what are what's driving them to do that

411
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,200
pen test because pen tests aren't cheap

412
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,639
we all know that

413
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,079
why are they spending this money on this

414
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,360
engagement right

415
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,880
is it compliance driven is this

416
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,079
something that needs to happen every

417
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,160
quarter um is there a way that we can

418
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,839
say oh well if this is compliance driven

419
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,760
let's make sure we hit pci audit tests

420
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,600
let's make sure we offer you know a

421
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,440
letter at testation or some sort of

422
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,880
client-facing letter that might show

423
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,720
that we've done this you know for you

424
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,880
that you can show your clients

425
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,320
is it new infrastructure does that

426
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,079
client say oh well we're in the process

427
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,560
of migrating things from on-prem to aws

428
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,920
we really want to test out just the way

429
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,600
data flows and like

430
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
what you can see from this subnet versus

431
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,639
another subnet

432
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,560
but really understanding what the client

433
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,800
needs and wants out of that engagement

434
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,639
really help you do the best that you can

435
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,480
to provide value and help that client

436
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,279
feel seen and understood

437
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,720
another note that here i have here at

438
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,880
the end is empathy and understanding i

439
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,959
think this is something that we often

440
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,040
forget and is hard to find in the

441
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,880
technical field and just in the world in

442
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,079
general but

443
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,680
the clients that you may be working with

444
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,920
maybe they're slow to get back to you

445
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,200
maybe they're not as quick as getting

446
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,480
connectivity set up as you would like

447
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,560
them to you know they may be overworked

448
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,160
and stressed out and dealing with sick

449
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,680
family members at home or a million

450
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,880
other reasons

451
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,480
um so one thing i always like try and

452
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,720
keep in mind is just be empathetic be

453
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,279
understanding be kind with other people

454
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,240
and that goes a long way

455
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
another thing that goes a long way is

456
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,880
owning your mistakes um

457
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,199
being proactive when things go wrong

458
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,959
will set you high and far and above a

459
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,680
lot of other people um you know if

460
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,959
you're doing a pen test and you knock

461
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,880
over a server you need to call that

462
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,399
client you need to send an email you

463
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,680
need to call them you need to leave the

464
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,360
voicemail if they don't get back to you

465
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,720
quickly at least you did something to

466
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,959
say hey we ran a script

467
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,560
now the server is not responding to ping

468
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,399
anymore maybe you all should go check it

469
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,399
out because conversely the opposite of

470
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,079
that is that client having to reach out

471
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,000
to you and say hey were you testing

472
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
against this ip

473
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,800
because all of a sudden one of our card

474
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,639
processing servers is down and we've

475
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,639
lost x amount of dollars in business etc

476
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,839
etc

477
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,760
um so things will go wrong in the course

478
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,360
of pentesting they always do things go

479
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,279
wrong in life in general how you handle

480
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,079
those things um really speaks a lot to

481
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,000
your character and those are the kind of

482
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,680
things that make clients want to come

483
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,439
back to you and repeat business with you

484
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,519
just owning those mistakes and also

485
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,839
understanding where they came from and

486
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,600
what caused them and doing what you can

487
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,880
to make sure those things don't happen

488
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,800
again in the future

489
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,680
so another good kind of bar example is

490
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,600
if i was working as a bartender and i

491
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,279
rang in food for someone

492
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,199
um and that food was taking quite a bit

493
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,800
to come out you know there's a point in

494
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,000
time when i should realize as a

495
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
bartender hey they should have had this

496
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,560
hummus plate right by now um so we're

497
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,760
gonna do is we're gonna go back in the

498
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,279
kitchen we're gonna check we're gonna

499
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,800
come back out to the the guests and

500
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,880
proactively say hey i noticed the hummus

501
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,560
plate is taking a little bit of the time

502
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,760
you know they're working it right now i

503
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,000
promise it'll be out as soon as it can

504
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,120
maybe i can buy you around in the

505
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,720
meantime while you're waiting

506
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,320
you know so that's one example of also

507
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,839
being proactive about

508
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,519
noticing a problem and doing something

509
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,120
to alert the client about it and being

510
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,959
proactive to offer a solution to it

511
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,240
instead of having that customer that

512
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,839
guests be like hey where's the food it

513
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,839
should have been here by now etc etc

514
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,560
another good takeaway that um

515
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,000
you learned very quickly being behind

516
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
the bar is that the the whole world's

517
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,040
kind of a stage right especially when

518
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,880
you're bartending when you're behind a

519
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,079
bar you're not necessarily the

520
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,519
entertainment or the reason why people

521
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,600
go to an establishment but everything

522
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,399
that you do is is being watched right

523
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,079
you're you're part of that establishment

524
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,759
you're part of the scenery you're part

525
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,920
of the ambiance you know eyes are on you

526
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,079
whether you want them to be or not right

527
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,199
so people are going to notice when you

528
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,959
do things are you on your phone are you

529
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,639
touching your face you know what's your

530
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,959
posture like do you look bored do you

531
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,639
look excited about work how are you

532
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,959
holding yourself things like that

533
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,639
um so keeping that in mind and

534
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,000
understanding that people are watching

535
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,079
you i think is very important in the

536
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,199
consulting world you know optics is is

537
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,839
very important right so meeting remotely

538
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,360
because you know kova and all of this

539
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,639
things i haven't done an on-site pen

540
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,000
test years

541
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,759
how do you present well digitally right

542
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,199
do you have a nice webcam do you have a

543
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,399
nice microphone

544
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,759
do you have decent internet i'm not

545
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,240
trying to jinx myself by saying that

546
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,160
is your audio and video quality clear

547
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,440
and clean

548
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,040
you know if you're sharing your window

549
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,800
are you sharing just the right specific

550
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,399
window that you mean to

551
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,759
you know are you sharing your entire

552
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,440
desktop and accidentally doxxing other

553
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
clients for sensitive information

554
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,959
so kind of keeping all of that stuff in

555
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,720
mind and how you present and what people

556
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,600
see

557
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,279
um are very important

558
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,560
another thing that i made a note of

559
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,160
visual indicators when you're listening

560
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,920
you know i i would always recommend that

561
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,759
you have your webcam on

562
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,519
um especially in the digital world i

563
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,279
feel like it's harder and harder uh

564
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,199
remotely to to form those connections

565
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,040
with people and that's just one way that

566
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,000
you can you can be active and be engaged

567
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,440
and be an active listener and nod your

568
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,760
head and smile and things like that

569
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,520
um i've worked with other people in the

570
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,640
past that haven't always had their

571
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,559
webcams on especially with client calls

572
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,240
and i've never really understood it to

573
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,520
be honest right like clients are

574
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,880
trusting you with access to their most

575
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,400
sensitive networks

576
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,640
and trusting you to to test those those

577
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,799
assets like the least you can do is turn

578
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,480
on your camera you know and smile and be

579
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,839
engaged and let them know what you look

580
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,119
like since you've got that kind of

581
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,520
access

582
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,080
another cool thing that um

583
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,360
really struck out to me is kind of the

584
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,120
power of narrative when it comes to

585
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,720
selling things and when it comes to to

586
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,400
getting people interested and invested

587
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,520
in things

588
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,480
so

589
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,400
when you're selling things and granted

590
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,240
i'm not a good salesperson so this is

591
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,200
just my opinion but um

592
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,559
constructing a narrative helps people

593
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,160
get excited about what you're talking

594
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,280
what you're selling and what you're

595
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,960
offering them right so like if i say our

596
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,559
special wine tonight is you know a nice

597
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,400
dry red it's eight bucks

598
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,919
let me know if you're interested that's

599
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,360
much less appealing than saying oh well

600
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,200
the wine by the glass tonight comes from

601
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
this family and producer in napa valley

602
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,400
california you know their vineyard was

603
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
destroyed last year and these wildfires

604
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,760
this bottle is part of you know their

605
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,039
last remaining stock they're trying to

606
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,120
rebuild their family legacy

607
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,480
are you interested you know that

608
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,840
customer is going to be much more

609
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,160
intrigued and and they get to be a part

610
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,760
of that story right they hear that story

611
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,919
about that wine producer by buying a

612
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,600
glass of that wine they're they're now

613
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,840
part of that story right people love

614
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,000
being a part of that narrative

615
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,480
so how do we translate that to technical

616
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,600
reports

617
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,360
um this is probably one of the biggest

618
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,520
pain points that i've seen in consulting

619
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,480
and something that people also

620
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
don't see as a problem until it becomes

621
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,559
a problem right how do we make highly

622
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,480
technical reports digestible how do we

623
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,400
translate really technical findings into

624
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,919
something that can be read and

625
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,520
understood by people that organization

626
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,720
that have no idea what you're talking

627
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,480
about right so whether that's the

628
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,080
c-suite

629
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,760
excuse me all the way down to like you

630
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,720
know entry-level analyst one like how is

631
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,160
how can we make our writing and our

632
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,919
reporting understandable by all of those

633
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,280
people and that's a really hard thing to

634
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,320
do

635
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,640
um my boss john as he spoke earlier

636
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,480
today he likes to say that what levers

637
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,240
can can we point out that this

638
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,840
organization can pull to fix these

639
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,600
problems within a company

640
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,160
so always strive to be as accessible as

641
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,799
possible when you write reports um

642
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,480
have high level you know executive

643
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,160
summaries and then get down into the

644
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,320
dirty details if you can tell a story

645
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,840
with your report get people interested

646
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,679
in reading it i think some of the most

647
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,120
successful reports that i've written and

648
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,120
turned in are ones that i've gone back

649
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,799
and read and really enjoyed you know i

650
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,720
started here i found this this led to

651
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,120
this you know making that kind of an

652
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,640
enjoyable story for people to want to

653
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,080
read will get them more interested in

654
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,840
the content and ultimately how they can

655
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,879
fix that content as well

656
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,400
so i've got a couple kind of assorted

657
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,760
pieces of wisdom that just kind of

658
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,200
didn't really fit in anywhere else but

659
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,559
this is a quote that got thrown around a

660
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,440
lot

661
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,880
when i worked in bars and restaurants is

662
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,240
that the most important rest the most

663
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,360
important position in the whole the

664
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,280
restaurant is the dishwasher

665
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,400
right so there's a lot of things that

666
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,480
you can take away from this but for me

667
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,400
personally it's don't be too proud to

668
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,640
get your hands dirty and do whatever you

669
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,280
have to do right it doesn't matter how

670
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,039
good the food is it doesn't matter how

671
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,880
awarded the chef is it doesn't matter

672
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,640
how innovative the menu is or how fresh

673
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,720
it is or farm to table or anything

674
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,240
if there aren't clean plates that food's

675
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,600
not hitting the table and no one is

676
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,760
eating that food

677
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,080
um develop healthy coping mechanisms

678
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,240
this is another thing that

679
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
i think infosec is a very stressful

680
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,000
field i think the world can be pretty

681
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,240
stressful these days but bartending and

682
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,320
serving was also a very stressful field

683
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,600
and there were a lot of people in that

684
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
field that

685
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,520
had a quick had quick access to

686
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,840
substances as far as alcohol and drugs

687
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,919
and all sorts of other things so

688
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,679
developing healthy coping mechanisms for

689
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,440
when things get hard you know going for

690
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,280
a run reading a book spending time with

691
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,400
loved ones

692
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,559
cooking but finding some way to

693
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,559
alleviate stress

694
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,840
and

695
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,159
um you know that kind of stuff will

696
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,520
will save your life quite honestly

697
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,400
i've got a quote here too from

698
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,000
a talk called a letter to a young

699
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,159
bartender this was from

700
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,760
what was this from

701
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,440
so it's from tales of the cocktail i

702
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,159
believe in like 2015 or 2016. um if

703
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,200
you're not familiar tales of the

704
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,000
cocktails kind of like the defcon of

705
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,520
cocktails in the spirit world and things

706
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,559
like that

707
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,159
um i would highly recommend looking it

708
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,159
up and reading it if you're interested

709
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,919
i still reference it probably like once

710
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,520
every six months or so um it's

711
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,360
definitely like more bartender focused

712
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,440
but it's kind of a very inspirational

713
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,960
speech in general so we had a quote here

714
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,799
from that it says you will not have to

715
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,480
map your route to your destination you

716
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
will be guided all the people you work

717
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,000
with from now on will be your guide to

718
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,760
the destination you have chosen if

719
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,360
you're clear about what you want and are

720
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,720
truthful when people ask you what you

721
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,080
want and make yourself humble and

722
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,679
available to guidance you will reach

723
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,280
that destination

724
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,720
so the other takeaway from that that

725
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,640
kind of speech that i like is

726
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,559
just the cycle of like observing like

727
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,080
look at people that you respect in this

728
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,760
field and the way that they do things

729
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,120
how do they present themselves in the

730
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,480
internet how do they present themselves

731
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,000
in person how do they present themselves

732
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,320
at talks right the next step is doing

733
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
the things so doing it yourself right

734
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,080
trying to emulate those activities and

735
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,320
and do them as best you can

736
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,000
third is be observed right so realize

737
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,360
that as you are doing them there are

738
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,960
other people that are looking up to you

739
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,159
the same way that you looked up to

740
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,039
others

741
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,720
and just be aware of those eyes on you

742
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,400
and set good examples

743
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,720
and also put yourself out there right

744
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,640
do things like like conferences submit

745
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,400
talks you know get out there and network

746
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,400
and try and support others

747
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,720
last but not least um transferable

748
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
skills so this is something that i think

749
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,480
a lot of people with imposter syndrome

750
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,799
definitely struggle with um but i would

751
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,799
say that a large majority of the

752
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,880
the skills required for this field you

753
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,960
can learn in a lot of other places right

754
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,559
they're not always easy to like reframe

755
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,400
those skills on a resume but things like

756
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,240
effective communication

757
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,799
communicating clearly managing your time

758
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,799
managing yourself

759
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,400
a lot of those skills you'll learn in a

760
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,200
variety of places the other part of this

761
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,039
job that you don't learn in those places

762
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,039
the technical stuff those can also

763
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,960
easily be learned right there's tons of

764
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,880
great content out there online black

765
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
hills has got free pay which you can

766
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,960
classes all sorts of things like that

767
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,799
cyber mentor you know

768
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,280
self-paced certificates all the comptia

769
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
stuff osep things like that there's a

770
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,120
wealth of resources out there for for

771
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
learning the technical capabilities

772
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,600
right but it's not always as easy to

773
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,280
learn kind of like those soft skills and

774
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,880
all the other stuff

775
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,919
um

776
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,600
you know people ask me last time i gave

777
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,960
a talk like this someone asked like well

778
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,640
how can we learn some of these things if

779
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,799
we're already in a field

780
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,400
right i do think that's a little bit

781
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,799
harder to answer um i think putting

782
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,559
yourself out there is really important i

783
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,000
think a lot of people have talked about

784
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,159
like stand up and improv classes

785
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,840
um to kind of help the way you

786
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,200
communicate the way you interact with

787
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,039
people stuff like that i think also

788
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,320
finding a good therapist is really

789
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,159
important i think mental health is kind

790
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,000
of the cornerstone of the way that you

791
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,760
deal with tough and stressful situations

792
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,360
the way that you react

793
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,720
and finding a professional that you can

794
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,400
speak to and help kind of give you tools

795
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,640
to deal with stressful situations really

796
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,400
helps make you a better more more

797
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,480
well-rounded professional overall

798
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,799
cool so i think that's everything for

799
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,200
kind of bar skills that lead into

800
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,880
infosec skills

801
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,960
so now we're going to quickly move into

802
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,120
an introduction to cocktails

803
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,240
and i know there are other people today

804
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
that have talked about cocktails so i'll

805
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,840
try and not repeat things that you may

806
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,440
have heard already we're going to talk

807
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
about technique as well and kind of some

808
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,760
basic ratios and structures for for how

809
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,520
people build cocktails

810
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,320
so first and foremost we need good tools

811
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,760
like most things in life like pen

812
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,520
testing like literally anything else um

813
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,440
having the right tool for the job is

814
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,360
often 95 of success in what you're doing

815
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,039
um so i would recommend a boston shaker

816
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,880
set i've got one here that i can hold up

817
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,159
and show

818
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,080
um please don't use the ones with glass

819
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,720
those scare me

820
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,000
because you're going to be hitting

821
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,279
you're going to be shaking you're going

822
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,760
to be moving um why you do that with a

823
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
piece of glass in your hand is beyond me

824
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,120
i think the number one injury that i've

825
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,960
seen from from bar stuff in the days is

826
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,520
broken glass fingers slashed open we all

827
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,360
use those to type make money in security

828
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,480
so protect your hands and use metal

829
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,919
um the next thing we need is a measuring

830
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,840
tool so i recommend this japanese style

831
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,799


832
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,600
it's taller it's thinner it's got kind

833
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,440
of indentations and markings on the

834
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,279
inside of it that show where the

835
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,440
different measurement levels are

836
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,039
if we remember geometry i'm sure

837
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,640
everyone has seen kind of those cheap

838
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,559
short wider jiggers that you kind of get

839
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,000
for free at some point in your life and

840
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,159
everyone's got one in a drawer somewhere

841
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,840
um because these are taller and thinner

842
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,279
when you're when you're missing that

843
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,320
line the repercussions um like the

844
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,919
amount that you're over under pouring

845
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,520
are lessened by having that tall thin

846
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,559
shape

847
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,919
and then last but not least a nice

848
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,360
drainer

849
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,880
this is called a hawthorne strainer

850
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,400
there's one down here this is the the

851
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
cook's country america's test kitchen

852
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,919
winner you can see the anatomy of a

853
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:48,799
winner

854
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,240
there's also a strainer called a julep

855
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,760
strainer which look cool if you're doing

856
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
stir drinks but they don't work for

857
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,440
shaken drinks but this one will work for

858
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,200
both so i'd recommend these

859
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,640
um it used to be you can only find these

860
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,559
things at places like cocktail kingdom

861
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,159
or other sorts of kind of specialty

862
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,600
stores but i'm sure you can find nice

863
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,120
versions of these all on amazon now

864
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,600
these days

865
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,720
so why do we shake cocktails um also

866
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,919
kind of for the

867
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,360
just an overview we're not really going

868
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,720
to get into stirred drinks we're not

869
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,480
going to get into like

870
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
old fashions manhattans things like that

871
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,840
building and balancing those drinks are

872
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,799
a little bit more difficult because

873
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,120
you're really mostly relying on spirits

874
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,240
balancing these drinks we're going to

875
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,159
talk about sours is much easier with

876
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,159
sugar and citrus

877
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,600
so these are all mostly shaken drinks

878
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,520
and why do we shake drinks right so the

879
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,799
number one thing that we're adding into

880
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,360
a drink when we shake it is aeration

881
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,120
this is a quote from the savoy cocktail

882
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,159
book that said you should drink a

883
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,919
cocktail quickly while still laughing at

884
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:40,960
you

885
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,559
the other thing that gets added to that

886
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,400
drink during the shaking process is it's

887
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,559
chilled right no one wants to drink warm

888
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,840
drinks obviously unless you're doing a

889
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,760
hot toddy or some sort of room

890
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,440
temperature you know straight whiskey

891
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,960
something like that

892
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,159
we're also mixing those ingredients

893
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,520
together effectively and we're also

894
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,039
adding dilution right so this is

895
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,480
something that people often forget about

896
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,279
but roughly 25 to 35 of the volume of

897
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,799
any cocktail that you're making is going

898
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,320
to be water that's introduced into that

899
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,400
cocktail during the stirring or shaking

900
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,320
process right that helps round out

901
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,679
everything in the drink make sure it's

902
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,840
not too hot not too boozy that's kind of

903
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,520
like the cooking process of making a

904
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,039
cocktail

905
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,640
so with that in mind

906
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,880
one of the most important things

907
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,720
is the ice that you're using right and

908
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,320
if you take away anything anything at

909
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,520
all from this talk this is what i would

910
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,120
like you all to remember is that ice is

911
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,279
the most important part of a cocktail um

912
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,799
the smaller the ice the more of it

913
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,240
you're going to use the more surface

914
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,679
area there is that means that ice is

915
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,360
going to melt quicker that's going to

916
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,080
water down and dilute your drink faster

917
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,760
this may make sense as you know you

918
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,120
think about it and explain it but

919
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,640
you know people forget that sometimes so

920
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,000
using the right ice when you're making

921
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,600
drinks is very important

922
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,880
and you can use any of these types of

923
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,240
ice right it doesn't matter which one

924
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,720
you use but just understanding how as

925
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,120
that that size of the ice increases the

926
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,159
amount of time that you're going to need

927
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,480
to shake is also increasing

928
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,760
excuse me

929
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
um so there's no undiluting a cocktail

930
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,600
but you know if you're using power dice

931
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,080
like that small tiny chip chunk ice like

932
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,440
you might not even have to shake that

933
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,880
really maybe just like a quick little

934
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,399
toss and you're good to go because you

935
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,640
can't go back right once you've shaken

936
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,240
that and added that water you can't take

937
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,279
that water back out of that drink

938
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,080
cool so now we're going to talk about

939
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,840
citrus and sugar so these are the two

940
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,279
kind of main flavor profiles that we're

941
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,559
going to be balancing with in addition

942
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,760
to the booze

943
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,840
um dale de graaf is like widely credited

944
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,080
with bringing back fresh juices sometime

945
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,320
in like the mid to late 90s before that

946
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,600
and i'm so you can i'm sure you can

947
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,760
still find it a lot of places um with

948
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,520
sour mix so these big bottles of like

949
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,159
pre-mixed citrus and sugar

950
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,480
full of preserve is full of you know

951
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,000
food coloring additives all sorts of

952
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,840
nasty

953
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,120
stuff dildograph does have a cocktail

954
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,799
book but i would not recommend it no

955
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,240
shade to deal but it's just not a great

956
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,440
book

957
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,960
what we really need are just a couple

958
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,039
simple things so first and foremost no

959
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,120
pun intended is simple syrup

960
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,279
equal parts hot water and white sugar

961
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,120
shaken or stirred to combine i've seen a

962
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,039
lot of recipes that ask you to boil this

963
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,799
there's no need to boil this just turn

964
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,480
the water in your sink faucet as high as

965
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,279
it'll go add an equal amount of sugar

966
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,960
let it get all mixed up together and

967
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,480
you're good to go

968
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,760
the next thing that's very important is

969
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,600
fresh squeezed and strained lemon or

970
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,760
lime juice

971
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,360
squeezed citrus

972
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,440
makes or breaks cocktails um if you're

973
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,679
doing fresh fresh squeezed juice that

974
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,279
stuff starts to get bad and oxidized

975
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,360
within 24 to 48 hours

976
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,960
you might not taste it you know if

977
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,480
that's all that you've had but if you

978
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,720
taste side by side that same cocktail

979
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,559
with lime juice that's fresh squeezed

980
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,080
versus lime juice out of one of the key

981
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,679
lime bottles you know at the grocery

982
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,960
store that's not even the fridge just

983
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,640
sitting on the shelf you can taste an

984
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,399
absolute difference

985
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,679
um and then the last thing we need is

986
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,520
booze so this is kind of dealer's choice

987
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,880
whatever you want to use to make

988
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
whatever you want to drink

989
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,240
um there's a really good book out called

990
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,159
the 12 bottle bar if you're interested

991
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,919
in kind of building out like a small

992
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,520
small bar at home you don't really need

993
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
hundreds and hundreds of bottles

994
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,960
you know maybe a couple base spirits

995
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,480
that you're interested maybe a couple of

996
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
cores couple modifiers

997
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,440
that's really all you need

998
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,679
cool so now we're going to talk about

999
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,520
measuring ingredients so as i talked

1000
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,640
about the there's kind of

1001
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
markings on the inside for you know how

1002
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,240
you need to measure where the fill line

1003
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,039
is

1004
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,799
i've got this handy info graphic that i

1005
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,159
will use for the remainder of the

1006
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,360
presentation to annotate different sizes

1007
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,720
i'm going to do my best to call them out

1008
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,480
too but the nice thing about this

1009
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,320
is it's two ounces on one side and then

1010
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,760
one ounce on the other and there should

1011
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,520
be markings inside for one and a half

1012
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,279
ounces three quarters of an ounce half

1013
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,240
an ounce

1014
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,919
um one quarter of an ounce may or may

1015
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,279
not be marked but this one you can kind

1016
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,480
of eyeball since it's a small

1017
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,520
measurement

1018
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,559
so this is what we're going to be using

1019
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,919
to measure all of our ingredients for

1020
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,320
drinks

1021
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,480
cool so how do we build

1022
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,159
we talked about the boston shaker so

1023
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,320
there's a tall one and a short one what

1024
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,559
i like to do is build in the short one

1025
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,880
because as a clumsy person it is much

1026
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,640
harder to knock over

1027
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,159
when you're building cocktails you

1028
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,039
usually try and do the order of kind of

1029
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,559
priciness of the ingredients right so

1030
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,159
the cheapest things first

1031
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,080
it's much easier to put in three

1032
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,519
quarters of an ounce of lime

1033
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,200
accidentally add too much sugar and then

1034
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,279
just dump out some some lime and sugar

1035
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,720
juice rather than waste two ounces of

1036
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
rum that you can't get back

1037
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,240
so keep that in mind trying to build

1038
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,080
from from cheapest to most expensive

1039
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,600
usually almost always do base spirit

1040
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,279
last

1041
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,880
filling the smaller tin with all of your

1042
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,559
ingredients right and then we're going

1043
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,320
to fill the bigger tin with ice

1044
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,880
um as much ice as you can all the way up

1045
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,120
right

1046
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,559
so once we fill it with ice we're going

1047
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,039
to close the shaker give it a hit

1048
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,799
um this looks scary because it's just

1049
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,240
two pieces of metal

1050
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,320
but thermodynamics really helps us here

1051
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,919
because we add that cold ice and the

1052
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,360
booze that's going to cause the metal to

1053
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,279
contract um it's going to create a nice

1054
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,640
seal it's actually going to be hard to

1055
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,720
open this once you put ice and booze in

1056
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,640
here and shake it

1057
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,840
it doesn't matter how you shake doesn't

1058
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,039
matter what your posture is what you

1059
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,559
like to do whatever works for you

1060
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,080
whatever feels good

1061
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,600
the one thing i would recommend is do it

1062
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,760
hard and do it fast and if you're ever

1063
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,039
worried

1064
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,720
definitely under shake versus over

1065
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,000
shaking because i said you can't

1066
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,919
undilute a cocktail

1067
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,440
there's no getting that water out once

1068
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
you've already put it in um and chances

1069
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,799
are you might be serving that cocktail

1070
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,480
on ice later so the last thing you would

1071
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,080
want to do is over dilute a cocktail

1072
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,679
just to pour it on ice and have it get

1073
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,960
even more diluted as it sits in that ice

1074
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,559
so if you're like i said if you're using

1075
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,720
pellet ice look up swizzling just put it

1076
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,559
in a cup give it a quick zip zip some

1077
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,799
sort of spoon good to go

1078
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,159
the hardest thing about these is opening

1079
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,600
them that can take a bit of practice if

1080
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,799
you look at this image here what we want

1081
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,320
to try and do is create a straight line

1082
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,919
with one side

1083
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,360
and then if we look at it from the top

1084
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,600
down as you can see in this image here

1085
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,679
if this point is kind of six o'clock or

1086
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:38,960
nine o'clock you're going to want to hit

1087
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,640
perpendicular to where that seal is so

1088
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,760
heading out of the side and you'll get a

1089
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,840
nice crack and you'll be able to open it

1090
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,279
that does take a little bit of practice

1091
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,240
but um

1092
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,120
you'll get the hang of it

1093
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,960
so now we've got ingredients we've put

1094
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,480
them in the shakers we've shaken it

1095
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,120
ready ready to pour it off and you know

1096
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,559
we have a couple different varieties of

1097
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,799
how we can serve that drink so some of

1098
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,720
the main ways we do it are up so it's in

1099
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
a coupe class which is usually neat no

1100
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,240
extra ice

1101
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,039
on the rocks which is obviously over ice

1102
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,799
or we can serve it long which is usually

1103
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,480
like a collins glass over ice with a

1104
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,559
splash or something on top right so

1105
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,240
these are often like a tom collins

1106
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,039
something like that where you're going

1107
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,640
to build a cocktail and then top with

1108
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,679
just like a little bit of soda water

1109
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,279
i said ice is very important to making

1110
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,399
cocktails

1111
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,039
glasses are not important at all

1112
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,799
one thing i would like to say is make

1113
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,399
sure to chill your glasses before you

1114
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,399
pour drinks into them um we took all

1115
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,760
this time and energy and we're very

1116
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
intentional about getting that cocktail

1117
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,120
to just the right temperature for us to

1118
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,880
consume it the last thing we want to do

1119
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,320
is pour it into like either a room

1120
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,240
temperature or even worse like a warm

1121
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,919
glass and have the temperature of that

1122
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,600
glass there to negatively affect the the

1123
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,799
quality of that cocktail that we just

1124
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,519
spent time making

1125
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,320
cool with that in mind um this is the

1126
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,279
first actual recipe the presentation

1127
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,000
this is the basic sour recipe um also

1128
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,360
known as like the two three quarter

1129
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,519
three quarter and this is one of the the

1130
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,919
most stable kind of recipes

1131
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,399
nice easy ratios very easy to remember

1132
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,440
it's also very easy to modify

1133
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,560
excuse me

1134
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,918
um and one of my favorite drinks of all

1135
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,320
time is this build which is the daiquiri

1136
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,079
so that's two ounces of white rum three

1137
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,520
quarters of an ounce of lime juice and

1138
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,879
three quarters of an ounce of simple

1139
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,000
syrup

1140
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,399
um this is kind of like the the rest in

1141
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,000
the middle kind of the pocket for where

1142
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,199
we are when we're going to make drinks

1143
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,879
we can add things wherever we want to

1144
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,399
kind of get weird but this

1145
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,918
two-three-quarter three-quarter of two

1146
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,760
ounces of booze three-quarter citrus

1147
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,599
three-quarter sugar is kind of like

1148
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,280
what's going to give us a good starting

1149
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,359
point for balance

1150
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,800
as you're making drinks obviously you

1151
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,399
can taste as you go if you want things a

1152
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,520
little bit sweeter you want things a

1153
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,719
little bit drier

1154
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,480
obviously adjust accordingly but this is

1155
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,079
a really good starting point for kind of

1156
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,480
finding that balance of drinks

1157
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,399
so with that in mind you know it's often

1158
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,159
intimidating when you know you work

1159
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,520
behind a bar trying to remember all

1160
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,359
these different cocktails but one of the

1161
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,560
cool things about working with these

1162
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,480
ratios is it's really easy to sub in

1163
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,839
different ingredients or make slight

1164
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,800
modifications to that base ratio of a

1165
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,400
completely new drink

1166
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,240
so if we pop over here

1167
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,000
um so this is some other sours you may

1168
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,520
know so using that same two three

1169
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,680
quarter three quarter build if we sub in

1170
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,000
gin or vodka and do lime and simple and

1171
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,359
a little bit of orange bitters we've got

1172
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,880
a classic gimlet

1173
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,640
if we do gem line and simple we do a

1174
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,000
little bit of muddled mint in there when

1175
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,839
we shake it we've got a south side which

1176
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,160
is this one right here

1177
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,800
if we do whiskey lemon and simple and do

1178
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,560
egg or egg white or egg white or no egg

1179
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,880
white we got a whiskey sour

1180
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,320
and then if we do gin lemon and honey

1181
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,079
we've got a bee's knees so these are all

1182
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,000
like well-known classic drinks they're

1183
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,760
all kind of like that same basic two

1184
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,400
three-quarter three-quarter ratio

1185
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
a quick note here too about shaking with

1186
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
egg whites um i know robert talked about

1187
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,119
it earlier in his talk

1188
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,800
if you're not interested in messing with

1189
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,920
egg whites because you don't want

1190
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,599
salmonella or you're vegan or anything

1191
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,520
like that a cool trick is to use

1192
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,480
aquafaba which is a really fancy word

1193
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,079
but it's really just the juice that's in

1194
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,000
a chickpea can so if you get a can of

1195
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,680
chickpeas like goya chickpeas at the

1196
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,480
store

1197
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,079
strain out that juice you can sub in

1198
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,599
that juice in a cocktail and it'll

1199
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,440
provide that same consistency in body in

1200
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,560
a drink that you would get from adding

1201
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,520
an egg white to a drink

1202
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,720
here's some other slight sour variations

1203
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,079
so kind of still working with that same

1204
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,079
two three quarter three quarter

1205
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,760
um so we take that daiquiri build the

1206
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,680
white rum lime and simple but we put it

1207
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,200
into collins glass and we add a little

1208
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,119
bit of mint and top it with soda water

1209
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,640
we've got a mojito

1210
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,160
we take that same two three quarter

1211
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,680
three quarter and add one quarter ounce

1212
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,599
of allspice which is kind of like a

1213
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,839
cinnamon clove allspice

1214
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,760
very kind of winter baking flavor

1215
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,359
liqueur add a quarter ounce of that

1216
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,359
we've got a lion's tail

1217
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,760
bourbon lemon honey is a gold rush

1218
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,160
pisco lime simple as a pisco sour once

1219
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,560
again with or without egg white

1220
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,240
i kind of put icons here for how these

1221
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,920
are traditionally served but honestly

1222
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,359
like how you want to serve these up

1223
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,800
around the rocks is really entirely up

1224
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,760
to you

1225
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,040
with the exception of the egg white

1226
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,400
drinks i wouldn't recommend doing egg

1227
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,240
white drinks in the rocks but all these

1228
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,520
other ones you can kind of serve however

1229
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,640
you want if you want to get more

1230
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,079
enjoyment out of your cocktail you know

1231
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,359
you could take any of these and put them

1232
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,359
in put them in a collins glass put a

1233
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,040
splash of soda on or soda water on there

1234
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,560
and make a little bit longer of a drink

1235
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,560
tastes a little bit less boozy

1236
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,760
and lasts a little bit longer because

1237
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,800
you've got some more volume in the cup

1238
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,160
the next build i want to talk about is

1239
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,079
the daisy build so we're taking that

1240
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,760
simple two three quarter three quarter

1241
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,119
but instead of that three quarters of

1242
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,960
simple syrup we're going to sub in some

1243
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,400
other things right so we're going to get

1244
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,240
some added sugar from orange curacao

1245
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,760
here and then we're going to supplement

1246
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,520
that with simple syrup so the same two

1247
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,880
ounces of bay spirit we're going to

1248
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,640
tequila three quarters of an ounce of

1249
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,839
lime juice and then instead of three

1250
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,359
quarters of an ounce of simple we're

1251
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,040
going to do half ounce orange curacao

1252
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,880
and a quarter ounce of simple syrup just

1253
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,480
to supplement that and also add in some

1254
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,119
complexities from that orange curacao

1255
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,880
so this is a margarita recipe if

1256
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,079
anyone's from chicago you might

1257
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,160
recognize the the menu and these yellow

1258
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,800
chairs from a famous taco establishment

1259
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,920
here in wicker park this is their

1260
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,160
margarita recipe don't tell them i told

1261
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,760
you that

1262
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,079
um but yeah so this is the daisy boat

1263
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,760
kind of taking that initial ratio but

1264
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,280
subbing in another liqueur that adds

1265
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,720
some complexities of flavors and let's

1266
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,680
just have a little bit more fun

1267
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,359
so here's some other famous daisies that

1268
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,119
have been made in the past um we got a

1269
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,560
side car which is kind of similar thing

1270
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,560
with brandy or cognac and orange curacao

1271
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,320
we've got a cosmopolitan which most

1272
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
people don't know is a daisy but if made

1273
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,480
correctly is a very delicious drink

1274
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,079
i like to make this with just like a

1275
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,760
scant like quarter ounce of cranberry

1276
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,520
mostly for color more than anything um

1277
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,800
you're not really looking for cranberry

1278
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,640
flavor in that drink most of the flavors

1279
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,960
from the orange curacao

1280
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,320
the death daisy up here on the right

1281
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,160
this was a another chicago drink where

1282
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,320
you're not using um you're subbing into

1283
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,920
the course you're doing april and st

1284
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,400
germain this is a nice pink color

1285
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,320
very light very effervescent very floral

1286
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,480
very fruity uh very well balanced would

1287
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,760
highly recommend that and then we've

1288
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,119
also got the aviation which is a little

1289
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,720
bit more floral forward as well

1290
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,119
cool so the last kind of basic build

1291
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,560
we're going to talk about is the equal

1292
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,839
parts build

1293
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,520
um probably the most famous of these

1294
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,599
drinks is the last word so what we're

1295
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,119
doing with these equal parts builds is

1296
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,800
we're not using any sugar at all all the

1297
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,400
sugar in the drinks is coming from the

1298
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,920
booze and other liqueurs that are adding

1299
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,800
to it

1300
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,480
so the last word is three quarters of an

1301
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,839
ounce gin three quarters of an ounce

1302
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,280
lime juice three quarters of an ounce

1303
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,880
green chartreuse and then three quarters

1304
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,359
of an ounce luxardo marischino

1305
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,720
um these definitely taste a little bit

1306
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,320
drier because we're not adding any like

1307
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,560
additional sugar into the recipe

1308
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,400
but they're quite delicious so last word

1309
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,000
is one of my favorite drinks

1310
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,839
another quick easy win is subbing mezcal

1311
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,920
for gin in the last word people love

1312
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,960
that it's a fantastic cocktail

1313
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,240
and here are some other equal parts

1314
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,520
drinks that you may or may not have

1315
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,079
heard of um the final ward is the last

1316
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,760
last word spin-off that's got yellow

1317
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,520
chartreuse and bourbon and lemon instead

1318
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,599
of gin and green chartreuse

1319
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,520
uh the paper plane is kind of a newer

1320
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,079
classic cocktail also from new york i'm

1321
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,160
not sure exactly where but bourbon lemon

1322
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,560
amaro nonito and aperol which is quite

1323
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,920
delicious

1324
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,400
and then the corp survivor number two

1325
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,160
so playing with equal parts and just

1326
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,000
using all the sugar in that drink from

1327
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,440
out of the chorus is like another fun

1328
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,880
way to kind of

1329
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,160
take out that sugar and add more

1330
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,520
complexity because you're mixing in

1331
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,160
other spirits

1332
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,200
um

1333
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,640
so this slide is called creating a

1334
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,480
monster and i wanted to touch on this

1335
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,839
because it's a fun drink to make it's a

1336
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,920
fun drink to drink obviously i kind of

1337
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,119
break down where this comes from because

1338
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,280
a lot of people don't know but we're

1339
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,480
going to talk about the long island iced

1340
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,240
tea real quick and this is kind of a

1341
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,720
split based daisy so what we've got is

1342
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,240
we're taking that initial two ounces of

1343
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,240
booze we're bumping it up to three

1344
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,680
we're gonna split that three ounces

1345
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,359
across all of the white boozes or the

1346
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,200
clear boozes in the bar so gin white rum

1347
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,880
tequila vodka

1348
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,560
same three quarters of knots of lemon

1349
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,560
same half ounce of curacao same quarter

1350
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,880
of simple and the top of the coca-cola

1351
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,560
and that's a long island iced tea so a

1352
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,599
lot of people don't know that's kind of

1353
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,640
originated from that daisy belt

1354
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,920
real quick some ideas for further

1355
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,680
improvisation at home

1356
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,280
um adding a quarter ounce of comparing

1357
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,560
to any drink and calling it a bitter

1358
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,160
version of it or if you're from chicago

1359
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,440
adding a little bit of alert to that

1360
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,079
drink making fun syrups ginger syrup is

1361
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,079
one of my favorites making coffee syrup

1362
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,280
just like the same as making simple

1363
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,800
syrup except for using coffee instead of

1364
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,920
hot water

1365
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,160
infusing vodka with tea because of

1366
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,680
alcohol you know i'm not sure how

1367
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,599
osmosis works but you don't need to heat

1368
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,200
up booze to really make confusions as

1369
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,880
the last talk also mentioned so putting

1370
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,319
some tea bags and booze is a great way

1371
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,359
to add some unique flavor

1372
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,599
characteristics to something like vodka

1373
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,800
um and then just kind of playing around

1374
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,000
with any other source of liquors that

1375
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,440
you have to kind of replace that sugar

1376
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,079
and simple syrup in the recipes

1377
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,680
i've got a slide here quick for further

1378
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,400
reading

1379
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,440
um

1380
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,280
there's some websites there's some books

1381
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,280
uh if you're interested in more uh the

1382
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,880
bar book is my favorite by jeffrey

1383
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,319
morgenthaler it's a really good kind of

1384
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,640
mix of technique as well as like tips

1385
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,319
and tricks and recipes so probably like

1386
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,680
the best all-around book for making

1387
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,119
drinks at home

1388
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,720
and then the last slide i want to get to

1389
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,720
my last minute here is my favorite drink

1390
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,640
to make and drink which is the jungle

1391
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,480
bird so we didn't really talk about tiki

1392
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,160
but um this is a tiki drink with two

1393
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,720
ounces of rum lime juice campari to kind

1394
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,640
of bitter bitter out and kind of even

1395
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,760
out some of that sweetness from the

1396
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,200
pineapple juice

1397
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,720
simple syrup and a little bit of china

1398
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,240
which is like a dark artichoke liqueur

1399
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,359
which kind of adds some bitterness to it

1400
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,079
and cool i think that's about time

1401
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,040
on the dot
