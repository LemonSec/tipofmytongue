1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,240
rob really needs no introduction except

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,520
if he ever shaved his beard in which

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,520
case nobody would ever recognize him at

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,359
all i see him sitting there and he's

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,280
already got the best prop room raider 10

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,920
of 10 a bottle of botanist gin to kick

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,320
off his conversation

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,920
awesome well thanks everybody and thanks

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,400
for having me uh this is such a fun

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,240
little format so i appreciate that

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,000
everybody to help put this together

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,080
and for those of you

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,720
that are in this talk look i appreciate

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,840
you don't get me wrong however in track

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,640
one uh is brandon and i believe it's

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,200
brandon's first cyber security

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,160
presentation that he's giving and so

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,600
it's getting recorded i'm gonna give the

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,960
talk anyways you're not gonna hurt my

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,719
feelings but you should totally go

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,039
support brandon uh other than that for

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,239
those of you that are sticking around

23
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,680
anyways or looking in the recording

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,800
we'll go ahead and jump in with the talk

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,320
this talk is around structuring

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,000
intelligence assessments and gen

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,399
cocktails and we'll spend roughly 15 to

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,480
20 minutes in the beginning

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,399
talking about cyber threat intelligence

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,399
and mostly around the intelligence

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,159
assessments themselves and then i'll

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,840
spend the next 15 20 minutes after that

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,159
making gym cocktails and then hours

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,280
after that

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,880
enjoying my cocktails while you all

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,200
continue on with your conference

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,759
and i put a blog link it's up on the

38
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,920
screen as well but i put it in the slack

39
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,840
in the track 2 slack

40
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,600
essentially this blog is going to be the

41
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
talk i wrote it last night

42
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
just make sure that people can and can

43
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,119
review it and be able to read it as

44
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,040
they'd like not a huge powerpoint fans

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,119
we're not going to do any slides a day

46
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,920
and then down at the end of the blog

47
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,479
there is my spreadsheet with the gen

48
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,479
cocktails that we're going to talk about

49
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,960
and some of them will make today so

50
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,600
anyways uh hello folks my name is rob

51
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,680
lee i'm the ceo and co-founder over at

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,439
dragos which all we really do is

53
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,280
industrial cybersecurity so like ics and

54
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,520
ot stuff today my presentations have

55
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,200
nothing to do with that except for the

56
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,119
fact that you need

57
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,840
control systems often in large scale gin

58
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,600
production so maybe there's a tie-in

59
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,040
anyways

60
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,640
but as mentioned today i wanted to talk

61
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,960
about intelligence assessment so let's

62
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,159
start off

63
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,840
i will highlight the sections of the

64
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,280
blog that we'll talk about i'll talk

65
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,599
about things beyond the blog so that

66
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,720
it's actually useful for you but that

67
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,640
way it'll um kind of center you in the

68
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,959
right locations before we care about the

69
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,480
blog at all though before you take a

70
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,520
look at it i want to start off with a

71
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
quick discussion of really what cyber

72
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
threat intelligence is in the first

73
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,160
place there's plenty of you that

74
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,400
probably deal with it in some form or

75
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,440
fashion but often times what i find is

76
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,560
that

77
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,599
people have

78
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,360
perceptions of cyber threat intelligence

79
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,840
largely generated by marketing and media

80
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,879
and

81
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,599
vendors talking about cti and so forth

82
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,080
really all intelligence is

83
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,400
is analyzed information about a

84
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,599
requirement

85
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,760
generally that satisfies the requirement

86
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,160
i should say generally it relates to

87
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,720
adversaries but that would be those that

88
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,160
have the intent opportunity and

89
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,000
capability to do you harm so that's

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,120
really all we're talking about you talk

91
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,879
about threat intelligence is i've

92
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,879
analyzed information to come up with

93
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,480
some insights and knowledge about the

94
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,319
adversary that helps meet somebody's

95
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,200
requirement that that first piece that

96
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
is really important to foot stomp is the

97
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,720
requirement you can do a lot of

98
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,840
intelligence stuff and skill sets that

99
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,959
are the same for intelligence analysts

100
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,200
but not actually doing intelligence in

101
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,760
other words there is no intel for intel

102
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,879
sake we usually call that the

103
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,959
self-licking ice cream cone if you are

104
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,799
not satisfying somebody else's

105
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,480
requirement you're probably not actually

106
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,159
really doing cyber threat intelligence

107
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,120
the whole

108
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,440
starting and ending place is somebody in

109
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,680
the world has a knowledge gap or pain

110
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,440
point about an adversary and they're

111
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,599
trying to address that and so that's

112
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,400
where we get involved now the first key

113
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,159
point this is where i'll

114
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,080
start highlighting the blog first key

115
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,680
point could really be summarized as

116
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,440
those three words there which is you do

117
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,480
you

118
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,720
i am pretty opinionated

119
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,959
and i'm opinionated about the world of

120
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,360
intel and how i would do things versus

121
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,040
how other people would do things and

122
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,799
i'll tell you it doesn't matter if you

123
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,799
are satisfying the requirement of your

124
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,560
consumer and you're doing it in an

125
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,760
honest way

126
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,480
then everybody else's opinion is just

127
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,040
that it's an opinion and the critique is

128
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,599
probably not all that valid i think

129
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,880
there are some things that you can do

130
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,839
really really poorly as an example

131
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,000
i think a lot of the ways that i see

132
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,560
security teams track threat groups as an

133
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,600
example

134
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,560
tends to be around malware they focus on

135
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,720
the malware itself the

136
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,160
some technical artifacts maybe the

137
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,560
exploit being leveraged maybe they focus

138
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,919
on

139
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,960
word usage keyword usage file names

140
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,919
folder paths install paths various

141
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,840
things about the malware and then

142
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,360
they'll start to cluster intrusions

143
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,120
based on that malware

144
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,680
that may be really useful to somebody

145
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,960
but have a little bit of problem with

146
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,360
the over focus we place on it because

147
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,520
oftentimes what you're tracking is not

148
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,880
necessarily the group doing the

149
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,960
operations but the group that developed

150
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
the malware and in some

151
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,120
parts of the world and in some circles

152
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,800
and some adversary groups if you will

153
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
they might be one in the same but

154
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
especially to talk about state

155
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,440
operations or larger criminal groups

156
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,800
usually the people that are developing

157
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,160
the malware are not the same people

158
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,360
acquiring and managing the

159
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,039
infrastructure that's being leveraged

160
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,160
are not the same people that are

161
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,400
actually on keyboard doing the operation

162
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,840
are not the same people actually doing

163
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,440
the analysis on what they get out of

164
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,120
those operations so sometimes our large

165
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,199
focus on clustering or grouping

166
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,600
intrusions or or adversary attempts to

167
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,120
get into your networks

168
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,520
by malware can be misleading but what we

169
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,039
actually want to track which might be

170
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,880
the tactics techniques and procedures of

171
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,479
the adversary which relates to more of

172
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,000
the keyboard operators and what they're

173
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,880
doing

174
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,360
during the operation so i can sit back

175
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,199
and go through that and say oh look i

176
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,560
think that's interesting i think that

177
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,720
might be wrong but at the end of the day

178
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,479
if you are generating intelligence and

179
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,639
generating insights that satisfy

180
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,720
someone's requirement

181
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
my sitting on the sidelines and being

182
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,440
like wow i would have done it this way

183
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,280
or would have done that way is largely

184
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,039
irrelevant now we can all try to push

185
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,800
each other to be better and hey i think

186
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,639
you can use these areas to be better i

187
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,680
think you can

188
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,440
consider these collection gaps or

189
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,039
knowledge gaps and we start throwing out

190
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,680
all those fun intel words we can be

191
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,039
collaborative as a community and

192
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,720
critique each other as long as we keep

193
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,039
it respectful um but at the end of the

194
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,840
day don't let analysts get in the way of

195
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,520
you and your consumer

196
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,360
and i joke around and highlight the

197
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,039
beginning that generally speaking the

198
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,160
only thing that analysts want and

199
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,759
analysts who can agree on is the analyst

200
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,360
theory is wrong you're not going to have

201
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,199
a whole lot of intelligence analysts

202
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,400
that agree about

203
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,319
most things let alone everything if we

204
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,160
did that's a problem means there's

205
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,919
probably a bunch of biases getting in

206
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,240
our way like groupthink and

207
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,600
it's unlikely we're all coming to the

208
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
same conclusion so i'm going to walk

209
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,840
through some of my suggestions as a real

210
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,280
estate intelligence assessments but they

211
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,599
really are just that okay you should go

212
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,599
through and actually

213
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,120
just make sure that you're satisfying

214
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,520
your requirements now i did highlight

215
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,440
that point about honesty and i'm going

216
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,479
to

217
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,039
talk about that real quick but we do

218
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,360
deal in a world of trust

219
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,039
when a consumer a business leader maybe

220
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,479
even the security operations analyst

221
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,880
that hasn't dealt with cti as much when

222
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
somebody looks into what we're doing and

223
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,360
asks us for our assessments and our

224
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,880
insights it's very common that it looks

225
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,000
weird

226
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,479
and and it's like how did you derive all

227
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,800
of that out of netflow and malware how

228
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,240
did you how did you come to that

229
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,360
conclusion

230
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,280
and and ultimately it can kind of fall

231
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,720
into one of two camps one camp is

232
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,120
it's such an obvious conclusion in

233
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,800
hindsight that hindsight bias being

234
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,639
another type of advice be careful of but

235
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,000
it's such an obvious conclusion in

236
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,199
hindsight there's questions to get

237
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,879
raised about why did it take you that

238
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,039
long to generate that assessment

239
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,720
and sometimes it falls in exact opposite

240
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,560
camp which is

241
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,639
uh it takes us a long time to get to an

242
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,199
answer we got to an answer and nobody

243
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,120
really knows how to repeat that like

244
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,960
from an external perspective not another

245
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
intel analyst but the consumer i might

246
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,240
be looking at what you came up with and

247
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,080
it just looks like you know dark magic

248
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,639
it's like what how did you get that

249
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,800
and and so because

250
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,120
who are consumers they may not have the

251
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
expertise we do on the field that we're

252
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,039
focusing just like every other security

253
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,639
field out there

254
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,599
it really relies on a lot of trust

255
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,599
and i often tell people that if you were

256
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,639
ever caught

257
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,120
misleading people or

258
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,520
um in any way um misguiding them based

259
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,919
on your own biases desires and personal

260
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,640
agendas or so forth you ought to pack up

261
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,120
go home pick some other field that stuff

262
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,200
gets out as it should

263
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
and because we deal so much in trust

264
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,760
eroding that trust will largely kill

265
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,200
somebody's career just as a quick

266
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,959
example if we look back and to

267
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,399
let's say the democratic national

268
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,720
convention compromise of 2016. for those

269
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,920
of you like i don't want to deal with

270
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,839
politics like it's the world of intel

271
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,240
man like wrong talk all right so if you

272
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,000
if you look at the democratic national

273
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,560
convention compromise of 2016

274
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,000
uh nsa cia and fbi all came out

275
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,880
and made assessments about uh who was

276
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
responsible for the dnc compromise and

277
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,920
why

278
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,040
and

279
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,519
they actually showed really good uh

280
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,680
maturity in their assessments where they

281
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,640
all came up with a high confidence that

282
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,399
russia was responsible

283
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,160
but they had a little bit of different

284
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,120
confidence levels as related to

285
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,320
the why it took place cia and fbi came

286
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,080
up with a high confidence assessment

287
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,760
that putin wanted trump to win the

288
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,040
election

289
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,279
nsa got there as well but they came with

290
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,920
a moderate confidence assessment so from

291
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,959
a consumer perspective other folks may

292
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,720
have looked into that and go oh nsa and

293
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,000
cia and fbi aren't fully aligned cia and

294
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,399
fbi have a high confidence nsa has a

295
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,399
moderate confidence as we'll talk about

296
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,160
later a moderate confidence assessment

297
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,959
is still a really good assessment um but

298
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,600
likely for the reason for the disconnect

299
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,880
is it even though it's not actually

300
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,000
disconnected

301
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,240
is the collection that a cia or fbi is

302
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,000
going to have largely relates to human

303
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,240
intelligence and the ability to talk to

304
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
individuals and be in the room where nsa

305
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
historically depends more on signals

306
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,040
intelligence telephone calls

307
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,240
cyber data of some sort and for that

308
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,839
type of assessment that gets into the

309
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,480
intent of an adversary really helpful to

310
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,000
have that human collection so because

311
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,399
nsa didn't have

312
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,959
all the collection that cia and fbi had

313
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,320
they weren't able to get to the same

314
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,720
confidence level right but let's roll

315
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,959
that back to the whole point of trust so

316
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,399
what was the what was the disconnect

317
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,680
well when fbi cia and nsa gave out that

318
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,279
assessment

319
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,000
a lot of news publications and i'm not

320
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,880
talking just fox just msnbc or cnn a lot

321
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,320
of news for locations a lot of the

322
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,240
majors came out and started having

323
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,920
guests from their shows and talking

324
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,760
about how we couldn't really trust the

325
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,040
assessment

326
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
and if you go back and set google to

327
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,200
just the time period and look around the

328
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,959
reasons given for not trusting the

329
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,800
assessment the number one reason cited

330
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,160
was the wmds in iraq

331
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,920
and people were saying look we trusted

332
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,680
the intelligence community back after 9

333
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,720
11

334
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,680
and they misled us and our politicians

335
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,839
and leaders misled us about what was

336
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,440
going on in iraq and there were not wmds

337
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,839
and that was the pretense for the iraq

338
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,600
invasion

339
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,760
this is misleading

340
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,519
what if they're doing it again

341
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,839
and from an from an insider view where i

342
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,480
had spent time at the agency that i said

343
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,800
agency nsa my caa colleagues always

344
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,560
remind me that they call it the agency

345
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,640
too but let's be honest it's lesser and

346
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,760
said with love uh when you look at uh

347
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,320
the nsa's point of view as an example

348
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,839
the nsa in 2016 was a different nsa that

349
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,800
existed in 2001 um different people

350
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,720
different mission areas people working

351
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,880
on incident response and intrusion data

352
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,079
related to hacking uh into the dnc are

353
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,720
not the same people working on photos

354
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,959
and insights into wnd movements in iraq

355
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,639
but to the public it's all intel it was

356
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,040
all the intelligence agencies and it was

357
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,480
you guys misled us

358
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,959
so long story short be very thoughtful

359
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,519
with your assessment it is better to be

360
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,519
mistaken than to be wrong it's an old

361
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,040
intel axiom

362
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,600
and the idea of course is it's okay to

363
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,959
be mistaken and then you correct

364
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,040
yourself maybe transparent in that but

365
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,639
don't be wrong and definitely don't be

366
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,360
misleading you you will lose the trust

367
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,639
of your consumers and they just won't be

368
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,720
able to rely on your assessments anymore

369
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,079
because again a lot of what we deal with

370
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,880
is in trust but part of that and part of

371
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,560
having that trust is being precise in

372
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,200
words i linked this article here words

373
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,519
of estimate probability if you go into

374
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,600
this article and it's free just to be

375
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,760
able to go and take a look at it

376
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,519
it is

377
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,959
essentially a manuscript written by

378
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,959
sherman kent sherman kent is one of the

379
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,839
kind of

380
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,760
godfathers of modern intelligence in

381
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,600
many ways and he'll go through and he

382
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,560
talks about what words to use what words

383
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,720
not to use kind of how they help a

384
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
consumer make it uh

385
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,079
take advantage of the information you

386
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,480
present but if you really boil it down

387
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,600
what kent is saying very accurately is

388
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,040
whatever you do

389
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,440
just be consistent and be precise

390
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,360
so if you're going to use words like

391
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,519
almost certain and probable as he has

392
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,959
over here in this graph

393
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,560
he actually has a mathematical kind of

394
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,399
consideration around it saying almost

395
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,279
certain

396
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,880
is a 93 percent or better insight give

397
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,480
or take about six percent

398
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,920
now you're not going through and

399
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,760
calculating each component of what

400
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,639
you're doing to come up with a

401
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,240
mathematical score you could you could

402
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,920
create a mental model or some sort of

403
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,440
structured analytic technique to try to

404
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,959
do that if you want it would be too time

405
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,000
consuming

406
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,079
but having it weighted with a number

407
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,720
helps keep us honest between analysts

408
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,079
because maybe i could be pretty

409
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,519
consistent in my own

410
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,680
word usage but as i get onto a team with

411
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,519
four five six seven different intel

412
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,560
members

413
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
the language between us can become a

414
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,920
barrier

415
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,160
and so to sit everybody down go this

416
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,199
word

417
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,079
has a representation of around 93

418
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,440
helps you understand the difference

419
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,279
between almost certain and probable well

420
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,639
this one has roughly 75 percent and and

421
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,639
it's not again to actually calculate up

422
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,160
anything it's just to put that there

423
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
going are you like 93

424
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,120
sure

425
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,199
then if you are you can use these types

426
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,519
of words and again it doesn't matter so

427
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,440
much what words you use but i would

428
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
create a scale on your team you can just

429
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,000
use the the ones that um sherman

430
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,560
put out but no matter what you do um

431
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,399
this is a good place for a style guide

432
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,160
but an intel team you'll usually create

433
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,079
a style guide not like a grammar style

434
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,160
guide that that can be in there but a

435
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,000
style guide would include what words we

436
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,920
use and which words we don't the meaning

437
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,839
behind them if we do use other

438
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,279
structured analytic techniques and

439
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,839
mental models um if we have sample

440
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,279
intelligence requirements that we've

441
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,040
already satisfied and how did that look

442
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,720
and what what kind of

443
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,040
outcomes do we usually address what are

444
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,959
our collection sources

445
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,639
if if there's none that aren't too

446
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,720
sensitive to put in a style guide i mean

447
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,320
you sort of have the playbook for the

448
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,639
intel team and this words of estimate

449
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,040
probability or a major portion of that

450
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,440
um so as an example i don't like the

451
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,959
word believe

452
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,480
and sergio would say belief is for

453
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,720
religion not intelligence i'm i can't

454
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,120
stand the idea of having belief well i

455
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
believe

456
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,240
that the adversary might have intended

457
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,399
to harm us you know they might have not

458
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,720
anyways like what like you know you

459
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,440
didn't feel confident with me giving you

460
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,320
those words it just seems sloppy and so

461
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
forth so not even just the might and the

462
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,839
probables and the so forth just

463
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,120
depending on how you deliver it it could

464
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,519
really distract your consumer but belief

465
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,800
what do you mean you believe do you

466
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,240
actually have data to support this or

467
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,720
not it's not an element of belief it's

468
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,120
an element of i assess this or i don't

469
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
am i just giving you a judgment call or

470
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,639
did i take the time to sit down and

471
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,480
actually come up with an assessment um

472
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,160
either way it's not belief now you may

473
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,920
not be so pedantic

474
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,839
but for me i don't like the word believe

475
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,000
so in a style guide we'd say don't use

476
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,519
the word belief instead here's some

477
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,800
other words to use in these different

478
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,160
situations

479
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,920
um and so again

480
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,839
it's okay whatever you do so long as

481
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,440
you're consistent because and this is

482
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,120
another key point here

483
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,959
the most one of the most important

484
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,959
things we as intel analysts can do is

485
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,959
reduce frictions and barriers for our

486
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,079
consumers

487
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,399
a consumer does not care how smart you

488
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,360
are they do not care to get into the

489
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,959
intel report as if it's a forensic

490
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,800
report to go down and go oh they did

491
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,639
this oh here's the hashes for that okay

492
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,560
all right i see the ida pro screenshots

493
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,720
like that's not necessary you can put

494
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
some candy in your reports if you want

495
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,959
um but but put it in an appendix or put

496
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,000
it kind of

497
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,839
down below the cut line if you will the

498
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,600
whole point of an intel report

499
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,199
assessment insight that we're going to

500
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,480
drive to them is as briefly as possible

501
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,120
as clearly and concisely as possible

502
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,440
delivering the intelligence that

503
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,839
supports the requirement not oh hey you

504
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,199
didn't ask about this but here's a bunch

505
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,800
of other interesting crap we found like

506
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,319
you can always have a conversation about

507
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,160
that but for the actual assessment for

508
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,760
the actual report for the actual product

509
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,520
that we're delivering them hey you asked

510
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,760
about x we're delivering you why if you

511
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,880
want to know any of the details or

512
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,720
anything else we're happy to expose

513
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,480
those to you but it's trying to be as

514
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,720
quick as possible because we want to

515
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,400
reduce those barriers to them consuming

516
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,919
it we don't want them to sit there and

517
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,679
go oh that's a nice picture of our brand

518
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,199
well if that wasn't useful to the

519
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,640
intelligence requirement then just move

520
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,799
beyond it right so

521
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,480
intelligence assessments are going to

522
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,360
have

523
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,039
different structures

524
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,080
we're going to talk about that in a

525
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,960
second

526
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,160
but the first thing i want to talk about

527
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,080
with intelligence assessments

528
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,240
is really again what exactly are we

529
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,080
doing in the language that we're using

530
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,320
so at the end of the day

531
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,039
and i see this a ton in commercial

532
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,160
reports

533
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,600
if you are

534
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,000
talking about something that is a fact

535
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,880
or an observation just call it that

536
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,200
there's no assessments required when i

537
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,720
open up an intelligence report i'm

538
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,320
looking for one or two assessments

539
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,600
because that relates to one or two

540
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,960
intelligence requirements or maybe i

541
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,480
have two assessments off of an

542
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,640
intelligence requirement i'm not looking

543
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,480
for every other paragraph has the word

544
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,720
iss or we assess because if it's not

545
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,840
mapping back to an intelligence

546
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,799
requirement

547
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,960
you don't need to put that in there and

548
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,919
if

549
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,160
you aren't dealing with 15 intelligence

550
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,679
requirements in the same report i don't

551
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,360
need to see 15 plus assessments in the

552
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,200
same report those are general rules of

553
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,160
thumb

554
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,320
but as an example i put in the blog here

555
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,080
if it's something that is a factual

556
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,919
statement that's all it is it has

557
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,080
nothing to do with assessments uh was

558
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,120
the malware on the system yes or no

559
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,720
we don't know because we don't have the

560
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,520
collection is a perfectly fine answer we

561
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
do know because we looked at the system

562
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,520
and there's not malware on it or yes we

563
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,799
looked at the system and there's malware

564
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,679
on it

565
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,280
none of that relates to intelligence

566
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,240
work

567
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,919
that's not an intelligence assessment

568
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,280
there's no need for an intelligence

569
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,640
assessment because ultimately an

570
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,400
intelligence assessment is going one

571
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,000
step beyond the actual data

572
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,919
it's going one step beyond the facts if

573
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,160
you will we're taking an analytical leap

574
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,240
based on the synthesis of information we

575
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,559
put together to say you know what

576
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,039
i see the malware on the system i see it

577
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,200
connecting out to command control

578
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,120
that malware and those command control

579
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,760
servers end up being used by these

580
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,559
threats these threats are focused on the

581
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,360
financial sector we are in the financial

582
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,520
sector based on all these things that

583
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,760
are factual statements

584
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,039
i assess with moderate confidence that

585
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,000
the adversary intended to target us not

586
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,919
just have us as a victim in other words

587
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,640
this isn't some random infection this

588
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,360
adversary is likely targeting us and we

589
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,520
are a target of their operation so i'm

590
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,840
speaking about an adversary's intent and

591
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,520
i don't have any collection or ability

592
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,360
to collect to go and be like hello mr

593
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,120
episode did you intend to harm us yeah

594
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,880
yeah you were my target like that's not

595
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,840
a normal interaction that takes place

596
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,440
and so we're going one step beyond the

597
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,960
facts and we're making an assessment

598
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,080
about the facts available that would be

599
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,280
essentially what we're talking about

600
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,640
that's essentially good intelligence

601
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,440
work

602
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,679
if there's a requirement for that if the

603
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,919
response is going to be the same the

604
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,360
company's not going to do anything with

605
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,720
the information of being a victim versus

606
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,559
being a target then there's no reason to

607
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,840
slow things down with the intelligence

608
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
work if it's just hey if we have now in

609
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,960
the system we're going to respond that

610
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,799
way great cti analysts can take a step

611
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,880
back don't complicate anything let

612
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,200
people go do their work no problem no

613
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,640
need for an intelligence requirement no

614
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,159
need for an assessment

615
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,000
but if being a target versus being a

616
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,159
victim in this case matters

617
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,360
then we will actually put that work

618
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,520
together or hey we saw

619
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,840
50 different intrusions across the

620
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,919
company this last quarter

621
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,240
of those 50 intrusions 20 of them were

622
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,080
successful and actually

623
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,720
got into some level with three of them

624
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
leading to an actual incident at the

625
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,280
company

626
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
are there any groups that are associated

627
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,520
with the three and are there any

628
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,240
patterns around tactics and techniques

629
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,080
and infrastructure they're leveraging

630
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,240
that we could group these intrusions

631
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,000
into

632
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
adversary groups where we would be able

633
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,559
to define

634
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,240
run books playbooks

635
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,640
scalable detections et cetera against

636
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,919
those intrusions that's great

637
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,240
intelligence work yep cool you have a

638
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,000
knowledge gap or pain point we're going

639
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,159
to synthesize intrusions and synthesize

640
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,600
adversary data and come up with

641
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,200
assessments about them perfectly

642
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,559
realistic

643
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,720
so you will probably be familiar with

644
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,400
low confidence moderate confidence high

645
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,760
confidence you've probably seen or heard

646
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,120
those words before

647
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,039
and what i'll note with them just like

648
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,000
the

649
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,039
estimate of

650
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,880
words of estimate of language we want to

651
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,640
be precise with what they mean now

652
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,080
there's a lot of things that can go into

653
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,000
it but the short and simple version for

654
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,960
me

655
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,440
would be a low confidence assessment is

656
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,679
a supported hypothesis it's not just a

657
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,559
guess

658
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,559
not just some information manifested now

659
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,039
i'm guessing if that were the case

660
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,799
i could just say that they say we don't

661
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,080
know we haven't put the time and effort

662
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,400
on this but based on my experience

663
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
i'm gonna give you a judgment

664
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,000
but i've told you where it's coming from

665
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,679
not synthesis of insights and

666
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,520
intelligence work but based on my

667
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,600
experience and intel animals especially

668
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,000
those that specialize in various fields

669
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
are perfectly capable members to make

670
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,840
analytical leaps to make analytical

671
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,480
judgments to talk about their experience

672
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,159
relative to a situation there's nothing

673
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,320
wrong with that but it's not an

674
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,159
assessment at that point it's an

675
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,760
analytic judgment

676
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,679
now let's say though a low confidence as

677
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,200
i was talking about earlier i've got a

678
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,600
hypothesis that is supported it's not a

679
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,559
guess

680
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,840
now there are

681
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,919
other hypotheses

682
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,240
that could be accurate right and maybe

683
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,440
i've identified some of them maybe

684
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,360
there's five or six

685
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,559
uh possible outcomes of this scenario or

686
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,159
hypotheses

687
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,880
and i've looked at them and we have

688
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,720
evidence or an insight and data to

689
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,960
support this one as the leading

690
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,240
hypothesis

691
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,559
but we haven't had a lot of time maybe a

692
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,640
factor or maybe we don't have a lot of

693
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,360
collection maybe a factor

694
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,960
or maybe

695
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,039
it's some element of a changing scenario

696
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,360
ukraine scenario right now going on with

697
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,600
russia that absolutely the changing

698
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,200
geopolitical nature

699
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,120
could mean that other hypotheses end up

700
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,240
getting more weighted or more

701
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,640
information relative to them over time

702
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,679
so i might say at this time

703
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,559
based on the available information

704
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,440
we assess with low confidence this this

705
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,880
answer right

706
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,360
and that is a perfectly supported

707
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,440
perfectly usable assessment but i know

708
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,799
on my team

709
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,520
that it's likely single sourced in other

710
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,720
words as i'm collecting information

711
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
maybe i'm only getting malware data at a

712
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,880
virus total maybe i'm getting netflow

713
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,120
information out of team camro

714
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,039
maybe i'm getting

715
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,000
open source information out there but

716
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
even though i might have multiple

717
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,279
sources

718
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,640
you know osen netflow malware database

719
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,559
it might not actually be multiple

720
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,159
sources because the open source

721
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,520
information might be reporting about

722
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,960
what's in those power databases the

723
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,480
malware database and the netflow may be

724
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,720
about the same infection and i'm still

725
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,640
looking at the same case so you'll be

726
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,559
really careful just because i'm getting

727
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,159
the information from multiple databases

728
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,240
doesn't mean it's multi-sourced so as

729
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,520
i'm looking at it and i go this is

730
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
single-sourced information so if that

731
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,360
information is wrong or that source is

732
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,880
wrong or that source isn't as

733
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,120
trustworthy as i would like or even if

734
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
it is trustworthy but i know i'm missing

735
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,400
a bunch of information from other

736
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,240
sources that's not something that i'm

737
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,000
really going to be able to rely on

738
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,320
so again it's it's a good assessment but

739
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
it's low confidence when i get to

740
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,720
moderate confidence i'm now supporting

741
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,919
it likely with multiple pieces of

742
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,919
information ideally we're getting to

743
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,200
multi-source but we still might be

744
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,120
single sourced but the big difference

745
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,640
between the low confidence the moderate

746
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,400
confidence as i've either had enough

747
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,320
time or resources

748
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,600
go analyze those collection gaps maybe i

749
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,440
don't have an incident response team

750
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,440
inside of the company to give me all the

751
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
insights that i want them only operating

752
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,520
about what's coming out of

753
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,039
that company through those databases

754
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,440
like virustotal or news sources

755
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,320
and so i know i've got collection gaps

756
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,559
but i can look at those collection gaps

757
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,919
and determine

758
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,559
one can we get around them can we go get

759
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,039
that collection oh and two

760
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,440
even if we had that collection is it

761
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,960
reasonable to suggest that that

762
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,799
collection could alter what we're

763
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,440
looking at could alter on the hypothesis

764
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,919
in other words if i've got

765
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,080
malware samples original phishing emails

766
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,159
i know it's come in through a specific

767
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,840
convection vector i know that company is

768
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,440
compromised

769
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,159
going and interviewing the cso is a type

770
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,919
of collection but probably not going to

771
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,840
get a different outcome than the one

772
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,760
that i've already come to so i'm not

773
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,480
going to highly rate or weight that

774
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,400
collection gap because it's just not as

775
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,080
important so moderate confidence

776
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,480
assessment as i'm identifying and trying

777
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,200
to

778
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,799
mitigate those collection gaps but i'm

779
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,120
at least aware of them and i've done

780
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,520
some level of insight on is this really

781
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,360
going to change the assessment anyways

782
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,159
but if i've got something that is

783
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,559
very well supported i'm now in that

784
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,000
above 50

785
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,240
right it's not the either or flip a coin

786
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,760
kind of feel it's

787
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,279
hey 60 70 75 percent i feel this is the

788
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,279
right answer but a moderate confidence

789
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,520
assessment is is the way to go when it

790
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,760
gets to high commons assessment

791
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,679
this is when a predominant amount of

792
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,679
available information and data supports

793
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,279
our hypothesis

794
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,400
we want to make sure that we're not

795
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,640
falling prey to other types of biases or

796
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,760
logical fallacies like becoming anchored

797
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,320
on one piece of information or

798
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,279
um having some level of congruence bias

799
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,480
where we're not considering other

800
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,159
hypotheses right

801
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,039
and so

802
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,320
i've got

803
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,919
pretty much all of the information or

804
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,000
close to it is supporting the hypothesis

805
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,440
it's not taking away from that

806
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,640
hypothesis

807
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,880
and it is definitely multi-source at

808
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,279
this point it's possible to have a

809
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,520
single source to high high confidence

810
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,679
but almost never

811
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,120
i'm definitely going to have multiple

812
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,360
sources that are getting to me this

813
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,600
and this is a all but certain like this

814
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,159
is a 95 percent above like

815
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,240
it would be insane for us to be wrong

816
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,840
about this

817
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,000
in this given scenario so a lot of

818
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,760
information supporting it multi-source

819
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,200
usually there's plenty of time to really

820
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,120
go through the assessments

821
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,840
and again we've identified and mitigated

822
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,159
those collection gaps so

823
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,159
if you think about these

824
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,480
what tends to happen i talk about this a

825
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,440
little bit later what tends to happen is

826
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
folks get

827
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,559
uh sort of

828
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,039
i would say biased towards wanting high

829
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,559
commas assessment so i put that down the

830
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,559
bottom where everyone kind of wants to

831
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,000
have high confidence assessments because

832
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,240
it feels like that's a better assessment

833
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,159
and it is i mean it's totally fair to

834
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,000
say hi comments assessment is a better

835
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,200
assessment than a lower moderate

836
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
competence assessment but low confidence

837
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,520
assessments are still the product of

838
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,120
good intelligence work and are

839
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,039
assessments that you can trust they are

840
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,720
good assessments

841
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,520
and if you find on your intel team that

842
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,640
you're constantly putting out 70 80 90

843
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,760
of your assessments are all high

844
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,120
confidence

845
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,720
the problem that you might be

846
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,919
experiencing is that your consumer is

847
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,720
over valuing high comments assessments

848
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,159
your analysts are trying to get to a

849
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,279
high compass assessment because that's

850
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,880
all they're willing to use

851
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,200
and hopefully the analysts aren't faking

852
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,559
any of that hopefully they're getting to

853
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,240
it the real way

854
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,279
but part of the cost is now it is

855
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,559
unlikely

856
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,320
that you are producing intel quick

857
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,080
enough right so there's those four

858
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,520
components of good threat intelligence

859
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,159
completeness accuracy relevancy and

860
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,559
timeliness cart c-a-r-t

861
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,480
and when it deals with that

862
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,720
focus what we want to make sure

863
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,480
is that we're getting intelligence out

864
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,320
fast enough to support those users and

865
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,080
those consumers so i should actually

866
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,320
have it where 40 or 50 of my assessments

867
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,159
are probably low confidence a little

868
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,600
less or moderate and a little less or

869
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,240
high um by bryson you've come on board

870
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,480
what's up man yep we got a question in

871
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,520
from slack how often do you or your team

872
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,440
use ach

873
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,360
yeah analysis and community hypothesis

874
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,520
is one type of structured analytical

875
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,120
technique if you're interested in

876
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,880
structure analytical techniques i would

877
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,080
highly encourage you to go check out

878
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,679
richard hure's work

879
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,679
and he's also there's a psychology of

880
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,600
intelligence analysis it's a free ebook

881
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,279
you can go download

882
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,520
and it'll walk you through that

883
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,000
my team doesn't use ach often ach is a

884
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
very intensive structured analytic

885
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,240
technique i find it very valuable but it

886
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,640
would only be used for some particularly

887
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,799
like important assessments where you

888
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,720
want to be very methodical and the most

889
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,159
important thing sometimes out of

890
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,440
structured assessment

891
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
structured analytic techniques is not

892
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
necessarily that your outcome changes

893
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,720
it's more that that you have

894
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,880
traceability now you actually have an

895
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,320
understanding of why you came to the

896
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,000
assessment you did across multiple

897
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,840
analysts and that can be very useful

898
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,840
um so good question last thing i'll do

899
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,880
and then we'll switch over to the second

900
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,240
part of the talk

901
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,600
when it comes to the structure of an

902
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,200
assessment what i would generally like

903
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,720
you all to follow and again pick

904
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,679
whatever you want but just have

905
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,000
something that's specific um i generally

906
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,360
like to find that there's a confidence

907
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,679
level the analysis itself evidence and

908
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,799
sources easy structure of a statement we

909
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,240
assess with moderate confidence that

910
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,679
electrum is targeting the ukrainian

911
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,520
electric sector based on intrusions

912
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,720
reserved to the kiev electric

913
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,320
transmission substation by our instant

914
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,840
response team as well as publicly

915
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,159
available data from the ukrainian ssu

916
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,919
but right there anybody looking into

917
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,000
that does not need to be an intel expert

918
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,360
they get hey we're assessing with

919
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,640
moderate confidence and if we have any

920
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,080
relationship with them they should know

921
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,760
what that means by our interactions

922
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,320
across time then we give our analysis

923
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,000
and then we talk about where is the data

924
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,600
coming from yeah this is from our own

925
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,039
instant response scene as well as public

926
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,039
information and right there it's

927
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,600
self-contained into a very very easy

928
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,760
sentence that any consumer could use

929
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
have confidence in by having that

930
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,600
consistency and understanding what when

931
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,080
when went into it um so anyways

932
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,440
hopefully that gives you a little bit of

933
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,919
view into intelligence assessments and

934
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,440
there's a bunch of different articles

935
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,120
and readings and

936
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,159
videos that i'll link down here which

937
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,600
would be useful for you but at the end

938
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,000
of the day if you're giving consistency

939
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,600
and language and consistency in your

940
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,080
analysis and it's something that's

941
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,480
transparent and generally repeatable and

942
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,159
you've established that relationship

943
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,519
with your consumer on the words you

944
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,600
choose and so forth you're going to do a

945
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,919
good job again don't freak out about

946
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,760
other people doing things differently

947
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,519
the world of intel is a very intimate

948
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,000
relationship between the producer or the

949
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,159
intel generation capacity and the intel

950
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,559
consumption based state all right uh

951
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,760
bryson i think there might be another

952
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,360
question then we can get in yeah i feel

953
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,880
like we should get the the threat until

954
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,039
one's out now um

955
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,519
so uh i don't know if you can see it but

956
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,440
they have the results of your current

957
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,840
take on the

958
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,600
um so we have seven percent provides

959
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,000
value for the stock 31 good to show

960
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,960
external visitors and 62 percent waste

961
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,519
of dollars should be banned yeah i was

962
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,000
glad that he threw up that poll um look

963
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,600
i'll i'll just

964
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,519
i i i am mr

965
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,600
everything is you know you do you at the

966
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,120
same time that's one of the areas that

967
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,279
draw a line and go you are wrong if

968
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,519
you're using pew pew maps and all the

969
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,799
but the management likes her it can get

970
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,559
budget or whatever all you're doing is

971
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,399
training your leadership to be stupid

972
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,799
and and if we deal in trust as intel

973
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,200
analysts then i can't have something on

974
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,120
a screen that's useless

975
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,279
that looks pretty and tries to get

976
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,960
people to go to an outcome because all

977
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,360
i'm telling them is i'm willing to

978
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,440
do tricks to get you to do what i want

979
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,399
you to do

980
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,679
and and that is is counter to everything

981
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:20,720
that it is to be an indulging

982
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
professional so it's just to me it's a

983
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,320
good example of one of one of the few

984
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,840
things you can actually be wrong on in

985
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,200
the world of intel

986
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,360
well that also goes into eroding trust

987
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,799
too right yes

988
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,840
absolutely

989
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,120
all right so i think we got about 10

990
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,240
minutes left for gin and tonic stuff um

991
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,159
so again as at the bottom of the

992
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:38,960
actually i'll go ahead and share my

993
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,000
screen again at the bottom of the blog

994
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,640
is uh this spreadsheet that i made this

995
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,120
morning for this talk uh and uh look

996
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,559
you're it's the same thing as intel this

997
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,600
is one of the reasons i love gen

998
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,760
cocktails and cocktails and cyber threat

999
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,519
intelligence have a lot in common in the

1000
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,240
sense that like you do you there's

1001
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,760
some bartenders out there and guides

1002
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,200
they're like no it's going to be 1.5

1003
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,279
ounces versus 2 ounces and like just do

1004
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,519
it to taste yeah and i'm for that

1005
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,120
purpose usually i have like a cocktail

1006
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,360
set and i'll actually have like a 1.5

1007
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,919
ounce and you know

1008
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,760
shakers and everything else today i'm

1009
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,279
going to keep it real simple i'm not

1010
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,679
even getting precise on the measurements

1011
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,919
but i put the ones that i like in the

1012
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,480
excel spreadsheet for you but what i

1013
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,960
wanted to do was show you how gin

1014
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,039
cocktails don't have to be intimidating

1015
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,880
like on the right side

1016
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,600
of the screen like if you scroll over we

1017
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,360
start getting into places where there's

1018
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,840
you know chartreuse and brandy and and

1019
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,919
you know creme de velez and and like you

1020
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,600
know as a kid from alabama those are all

1021
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,159
pretty big words and uh i'm like oh

1022
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,000
that's intimidating and so if you start

1023
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,919
over on the right hand side you're

1024
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,039
probably not going to get antigen

1025
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,679
cocktails but the classic one

1026
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,480
so let's start with these um all of

1027
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,159
these can be made with just very simple

1028
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,880
ingredients right so if you've got your

1029
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,159
lemon juice

1030
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,000
and just get something nice easy right

1031
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,919
real lemon is good got your lemon juice

1032
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,440
you got your simple syrup you got some

1033
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,760
greninden and you got some tonic you can

1034
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,120
make four or five different drinks and

1035
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,800
this isn't the world

1036
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,520
of drinks here but as an example

1037
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
we'll start with one of the gens i'll

1038
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,040
use the botanist there's a bunch of

1039
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,399
different types of gens out there of

1040
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,440
course

1041
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,399
what we generally like to see is

1042
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,760
natural grains like something that's

1043
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,839
very pure and i like to keep the

1044
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,159
ingredient list pretty small there's

1045
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,839
plenty different styles out there so

1046
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,480
like roku jin out of the centauri

1047
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,960
distillery in japan you'll notice that

1048
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,480
it's um essentially uh grain neutral

1049
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,440
spirits with juniper all your gens are

1050
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,040
gonna have juniper in it and then they

1051
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,239
pick like six local japanese botanicals

1052
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,560
same thing we've got this one here bar

1053
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,879
hill from maryland that's where i live

1054
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,119
currently um support actually sorry i

1055
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,480
bought it in maryland it's from vermont

1056
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,800
but it's uh the local local place that

1057
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,320
gives it out and this one is just

1058
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,880
juniper and honey and the natural grain

1059
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,960
spirits so everything's going to have a

1060
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,640
different little flavor the botanist is

1061
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,240
one of my go-to's

1062
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,160
they've got a little over 20

1063
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,240
different botanicals in here

1064
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,079
and it's from scotland

1065
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,079
one of the things that i like is if i

1066
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,160
just take and i'll just take a

1067
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,119
let's see nice cubicle over here

1068
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,520
drop it in and i'll i'll give it a a

1069
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,000
decent pour i'm again normally you'd

1070
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,359
want to measure these things out so i

1071
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,440
just give it a decent little pour

1072
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,280
and if i do nothing more than get some

1073
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,359
fever-tree tonic water which is um

1074
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,280
kind of a go-to for me as well

1075
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,160
right

1076
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,520
if i just poured that in that would be

1077
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,400
the gin and tonic right but if i if i

1078
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,000
take the same ingredient list and just

1079
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,400
add a little bit of greninja just

1080
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,640
a nice little splash of that the same

1081
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,720
gin and tonic that i had

1082
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,240
with one extra ingredient i've got

1083
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,480
another extra drink here pour that in

1084
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,880
together i get a nice little

1085
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,920
uh

1086
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,240
pink flavor pink looking pomegranate gin

1087
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,000
and tonic this i'm putting down is the

1088
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,839
g2 and t technically it's called

1089
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,599
pomegranate genatonic but i just love

1090
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,000
that it's gen grenadine and tonic so g2

1091
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,400
and t um or the gin and tonic but again

1092
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,640
if i had this same drink and started

1093
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,760
adding just a little bit different

1094
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,640
things

1095
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,400
i'd get a completely different drink in

1096
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,839
this case if i take the gin and tonic

1097
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,920
add the grenadine now i've got this one

1098
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,920
and if i take the the um

1099
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,920
same ingredient list

1100
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,240
but take out the grenadine i can just

1101
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,680
put a little lime juice and simple syrup

1102
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,720
in there and i've got a completely

1103
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,200
different drink

1104
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,000
so all in all i'm very simple yeah

1105
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,400
lickety

1106
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,920
go ahead you had something

1107
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:38,880
oh

1108
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,680
yeah yeah maybe a little bit but

1109
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,760
by and large it's uh it's linked in the

1110
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,079
uh the blog there for you

1111
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,520
um but

1112
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,119
um actually let me see if i can see on

1113
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,480
the youtube channel looks okay over

1114
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,400
there um

1115
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,760
let's get a little bit more complicated

1116
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,560
so

1117
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,640
those are stuff that you can easily make

1118
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,280
um at home when we come over here

1119
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,119
the next kind of class of ones to make

1120
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,320
is when you can start adding some egg

1121
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,280
whites

1122
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,599
i find the egg whites really really take

1123
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,119
a drink to the next level by having it

1124
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,560
be a smooth

1125
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,119
kind of frothy consistency all of these

1126
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,160
you're going to come up with basically

1127
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,839
the same ingredients to get to so again

1128
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,760
i'm kind of clustering these and hey

1129
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,280
pick one out of these five with these

1130
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,640
same ingredients pick one of these

1131
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,560
through these ingredients um in this

1132
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,880
case i'll do a clover club so the trick

1133
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,480
with egg whites

1134
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,160
is sometimes you'll shake things over

1135
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,839
ice but when it's an egg white you want

1136
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,599
to do a dry shake so that you don't

1137
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,440
break down the proteins in the egg yolk

1138
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,400
or the egg white i'm in this case right

1139
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,760
pour a little bit of gin in my shaker

1140
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,480
here

1141
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,240
i'm roughly three ounces but again i'm

1142
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,839
pouring to sight um you can pour the

1143
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,480
side if you want but probably better

1144
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,640
uh to have your um to be able to

1145
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,760
measure it out

1146
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,839
but again for a computer desk in my home

1147
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,880
office we're gonna do the best we can

1148
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,720
so get the lemon juice here for one

1149
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,640
ounce of lemon juice take a little bit

1150
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,079
of that grenadine that i showed earlier

1151
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,440
i can figure out where i put it right

1152
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,119
here so take that nice little green

1153
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,440
indian right that pomegranate flavor put

1154
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,680
a little splash of it

1155
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,040
and then

1156
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,640
all we're going to do is take the egg

1157
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,920
white

1158
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,000
which hopefully this all works well in

1159
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,160
my home office

1160
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,920
crack the egg

1161
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,880
and then i'm going to just collect

1162
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,839
the egg yolk you can use the shell to do

1163
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:22,880
that here

1164
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,400
essentially if you can take a look all

1165
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,320
i'm doing is having the shell kind of

1166
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,119
balance out as i pour out the yolk but

1167
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,720
pour out the egg white but keep the yolk

1168
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,240
in there right you don't want to break

1169
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,920
that yolk or anything like that i'm

1170
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,160
going to take that just the egg white

1171
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,359
that i've got here

1172
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,480
throw it in to the shaker

1173
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,240
that opposite side and like i said we're

1174
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,440
going to just do a nice dry shake

1175
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,960
there's no ice in here

1176
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,520
um just simple

1177
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,200
and that's gonna allow that um egg white

1178
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,839
to be able to mix in get pretty fluffy

1179
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,000
it's gonna make a nice drink at the end

1180
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,160
if i want to then i can add some ice

1181
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,599
either in there and do a wet shake

1182
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,920
afterwards so shake it over ice or i can

1183
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,119
just throw

1184
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,320
an ice cube or so into a nice glass pour

1185
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,079
it out and we get this kind of nice

1186
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,839
little fluffy looking

1187
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,640
like little pink monstrosity here

1188
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,640
but all in all a nice little drink

1189
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,320
yeah i know you guys can't taste it but

1190
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,920
it's phenomenal it was funny when they

1191
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,079
told me it was a pg-13

1192
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,680
rated talks it turns out there's a lot

1193
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,280
of cussing and

1194
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,520
alcohol in pg-13 movies i don't know

1195
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,599
what they're trying to tell me there but

1196
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,040
it's all about the same

1197
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,280
um beyond that another very simple drink

1198
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,200
that i'm not gonna make here today now

1199
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,560
but one i could with the same ingredient

1200
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,960
list is if i just take gin some lemon

1201
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
juice and some honey that is the bee's

1202
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,359
knees and you can also just add a nice

1203
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,000
little uh twig of lavender to it if you

1204
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
want to do a nice lavender

1205
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,839
bee's knees but this is the one that

1206
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,440
we'll go to next

1207
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,119
across the

1208
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,520
earl grey martini and royal tea martini

1209
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,440
or the royal tea cocktail

1210
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,760
i love these because they have tea in it

1211
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,200
i'm a big tea fan

1212
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,520
um in the earl grey martini you would

1213
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,680
actually just infuse the gin so as a

1214
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,760
quick aside you can infuse gen with

1215
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,680
almost anything just take your favorite

1216
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,960
bottle of gem

1217
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,760
like an aviation gen pour it into some

1218
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,720
mason jars and muddle up some like

1219
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,160
strawberries and throw it in there or

1220
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
blueberries or rhubarb or something

1221
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,920
flavorful in this case

1222
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,640
the leaves of one of your favorite teas

1223
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,599
and put in the fridge for five days

1224
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,359
every day shake it up a little bit at

1225
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,599
the end strain it out you have a nice

1226
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,760
flavorful infused gin

1227
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,040
so in like a martini as an example um

1228
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,240
what you're doing in a martini is

1229
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,720
generally gen and vermouth in this case

1230
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,240
though you can do gen with some lemon

1231
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,440
juice simple syrup uh egg white and uh

1232
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,920
earl grey uh infused gin that's pretty

1233
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,000
