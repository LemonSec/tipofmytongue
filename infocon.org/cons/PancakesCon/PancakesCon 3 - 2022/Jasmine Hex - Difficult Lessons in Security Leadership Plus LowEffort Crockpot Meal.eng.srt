1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
thank you bryson

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,720
i'm really glad to be here today this

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,960
has been a fantastic con

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,080
gratitude to leslie

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,639
and and ray and everybody else

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,880
on staff and volunteered

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,440
to put this on

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,080
um so kind of two goals today

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,760
the first of which is to help you avoid

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,160
my struggle as a baby seizo

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,080
and efficiently feed your face

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,039
um i am a first generation

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,558
knowledge worker first generation

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,640
college grad um

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,559
i have a neck tattoo

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,800
i am not a typical person security

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,559
leadership by merit of the fact i am not

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,520
a

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,280
white man

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
i've been a security leader since uh

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,039
august 2020

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,320
i feel like as you can tell from the

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,760
deck especially when we get into my food

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,120
i'm i'm a deeply messy person as well

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,160
um and i am in a wonderful feminist

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,280
relationship

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,359
but my partner on the right and i have

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,960
agreed that that life seems to be a

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,480
little bit better if i am

30
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,239
the individual who has primary

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,439
responsibility for cooking

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,720
pancakes versus waffles i like all carbs

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,439
i work hard color today um but i'm a big

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,560
fan of just

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
classic pancakes

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,479
as well as as biscuits and gravy

37
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,640
so a little bit about my journey um i

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,720
became director of security at a startup

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
cloud native startup um

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,759
in august of 2020 prior to that i

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,439
had a background in program management

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,000
and analytics

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,280
so this is kind of coming from the

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,960
perspective of somebody who has built a

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,479
security function

46
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,880
i worked really hard for about 19 20

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,960
months in that role past three audits

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,280
scaled security from series a to c

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,000
and in december i got a new job um in my

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
current role

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,040
i am

52
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,520
part of a great

53
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,600
security team of smart people and i'm

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,759
doing some research on about 400 million

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,960
cyber assets at 1300 organizations i

56
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,640
don't have my boss's permission to drop

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,799
this this knowledge yet but it's

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,320
relevant to some of what else i'm going

59
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,759
to talk about

60
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,280
and you can expect that report which is

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,520
going to be called the scar the state of

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,000
cyber assets report in late february

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
2022

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,879
so security leadership is difficult and

65
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,400
i think that it might even be impossible

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,760
um

67
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,720
csos are really not a terribly diverse

68
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,920
sector

69
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,280
um of the market they are 95 white 85

70
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,040
male

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,800
gartner research shows that the majority

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
of csos really struggle and do not have

73
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,879
fantastic results

74
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,480
um there's additional research to show

75
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,040
that the average cso lasts 11 months

76
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,840
in a job before quitting

77
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,879
the current research i'm working on

78
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,239
has showed me that the average

79
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,200
organization has over 200 000 alerts

80
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,879
in their backlog and that can be alerts

81
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,800
from cloud security posture management

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,720
tools like card duty and it can also be

83
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,519
vulnerability scanner findings

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,080
and it's it's really pretty overwhelming

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,680
especially when you consider the fact

86
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,760
that um

87
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,159
there is about one security person for

88
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,159
every 200

89
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,959
um employees

90
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,239
but something i have observed is the

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,080
fact that we are here

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,560
because of a deep commitment

93
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,400
um pretty much everybody in security

94
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
really cares about security

95
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
this comic is about cis admins but it

96
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,959
feels incredibly personal the idea of

97
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,560
climbing up ventilation ducts and

98
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,640
walking across broken glass during a

99
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,239
hostage situation

100
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,440
to um

101
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,920
kind of restore availability

102
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,839
it feels deeply personal

103
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,200
when i speak to people who are you know

104
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,040
more experienced than me i always ask

105
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,560
them what gives them hope for the future

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,400
of security and i can say from my

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
personal experience that the people

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,560
around me my community are what gives me

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,879
hope

110
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,439
i believe that we

111
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,080
can change and we are creating change um

112
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,159
over the last 15 years security has gone

113
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,720
from the basement to the boardroom

114
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,200
the cso's role in a business is is more

115
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,478
important than ever it used to be that

116
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,880
security was this weird niche hobby shop

117
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,238
of i.t

118
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,839
um in the basement

119
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,440
and now we're on customer calls for

120
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,960
customer facing which is something that

121
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
that emily gladstone cole referenced

122
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,280
quite a bit in her talk

123
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,520
customers care about security so they

124
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,000
want to talk to the cso

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,440
i think it's arguable that businesses

126
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,199
are increasingly competing on

127
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,720
confidentiality integrity and

128
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,000
availability

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,800
and

130
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,880
csos are crucial business enablers

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
and something else um that gives me a

132
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,639
lot of hope is the fact that large

133
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,479
organizations are shifting to an office

134
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,479
the ciso structure where there is

135
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,320
multiple csos multiple specialists

136
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,400
because the work we do is so important

137
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,758
and there is so much of it

138
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,680
it made me think of the quote by

139
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,600
margaret mead that many of us know which

140
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,039
is never doubt that a small group of

141
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,800
thoughtful commit citizens can change

142
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,560
the world indeed it's the only thing

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,280
that ever has

144
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,120
and i i think that security

145
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,919
practitioners um can create a more

146
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,600
equitable and secure future for

147
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,720
everybody

148
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,280
because we're not doing this work

149
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
for the work-life balance we're not

150
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,039
really doing this work for the money

151
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,240
because there is far easier ways to make

152
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,880
a living wage than security

153
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,919
and that level of commitment

154
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,520
is what gives me hope for the future of

155
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,840
security

156
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,479
and i think that being transparent with

157
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,400
each other about what we experience as

158
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,240
we progress in our careers into

159
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,000
leadership roles

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,880
is

161
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,400
how we can discover kind of shared

162
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
experience

163
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,800
and that others are struggling with the

164
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,120
same thing and we can use that to create

165
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,440
change

166
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,360
my cso sunil

167
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,759
told me this morning that when i showed

168
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,680
him a graphic that kind of casserole

169
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,639
discussing this graphic

170
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,319
to make a quadrant so i did

171
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,639
i made a quadrant to organize

172
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,680
kind of

173
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,280
experiences that we have as security

174
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,880
leaders there are some that are

175
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,039
wholesome there are some that are

176
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,960
intolerable and inevitable and i think

177
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,360
those are areas that we need to revolve

178
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,800
and then there's some that you know are

179
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,960
not that commonly shared experiences

180
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
again you know there are things that are

181
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,680
absolutely wholesome

182
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,000
and things where we need to spark a

183
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,720
revolution

184
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,680
so the first difficult lesson i learned

185
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,000
in my first security leadership role is

186
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,840
just how much relationships matter

187
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,280
gartner research on cso effectiveness

188
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,360
shows that the most effective cso spend

189
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,479
a lot of time building relationships

190
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,560
with other leaders

191
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,840
and something i learned is the

192
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,680
importance of partnerships

193
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,400
with sales with marketing with business

194
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,680
because there is so much work and we

195
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,440
cannot do it on our own

196
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,360
um something else

197
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,880
and this was from a different study is

198
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
that the most effective csos avoid being

199
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,800
in a defensive position over incidents

200
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,039
over risk

201
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,759
they don't apologize and that kind of

202
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,680
not going on the defensive allows them

203
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,599
to create better sense of partnership

204
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,759
like it's it's everybody's job to fix

205
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,960
these risks

206
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,440
we need cross-functional collaboration

207
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,840
i think that is critically important

208
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,880
um

209
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,280
building social capital is another thing

210
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,080
that i think is is very important um

211
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,400
less difficult in the sense that that

212
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,520
most of us

213
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,840
are pretty good at it already you know

214
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
as a security person you can't really

215
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,520
force anybody to do anything there are

216
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,199
security teams that try

217
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,400
to

218
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,919
kind of be agents of punishment but i

219
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,360
don't think it's terribly effective for

220
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,680
them um so leading by influence is

221
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,360
something that that most of us are very

222
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,879
good at already

223
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,639
and the last concept is something that

224
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,639
really kind of surprised me

225
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,720
is that when you need something um you

226
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,039
know my instinct is to march in there

227
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,599
with the 45 page deck that i stayed up

228
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,800
all night making that has all these

229
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,280
radar charts showing like making a clear

230
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,960
case for here's why i need these three

231
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,319
hires

232
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,639
and that's not really how executives

233
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,440
work

234
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,199
you know you have to kind of seed an

235
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,960
idea and you have to nurture it you have

236
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,800
to bring it up several times

237
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,120
um

238
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,519
because you know i think that many of us

239
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,039
get to a leadership role because we are

240
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,559
so effective at being

241
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,159
analytical and great at our jobs and

242
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,440
once we're there

243
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,120
we have to develop a new kind of soft

244
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,320
skill set

245
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,519
to negotiate what we need

246
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,240
the industry does need change and this

247
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,000
is not just security it's the workforce

248
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,920
you know there's a lot of studies that

249
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,800
show

250
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,760
how much

251
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,120
individuals from under represented

252
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,680
backgrounds like myself i'm a woman

253
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,839
um face bias

254
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,440
which is that you know people like to

255
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,480
promote and resource uh people who

256
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,959
are are like themselves

257
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,760
you know i think that

258
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
the odds are better if success if you go

259
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,959
into an organization where there is a

260
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,680
more diverse c-suite

261
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,839
um and as we create more diversity at

262
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,000
the top the process of building

263
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
relationships between leadership becomes

264
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,240
easier

265
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,160
i talk to so many people on a daily

266
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,519
basis who deal with imposter syndrome

267
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,279
and i think that we need to call others

268
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,040
out on it when we hear

269
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,600
you know women leaders or or individuals

270
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,440
who are minority talking about how they

271
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,560
don't feel qualified to be in a

272
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,839
leadership position we need to call each

273
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,360
other out on this

274
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,000
um something that we can change is is

275
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
clear promotion pathways and

276
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,120
okrs for the teams that we're building

277
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,040
to create a more level playing field and

278
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,839
avoid promoting based on bias

279
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,080
and yeah creating more diverse teams as

280
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,320
well

281
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,959
so the first tip i have is that

282
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,880
leaders spend friday on gratitude and

283
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,240
recognition

284
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
recognize your teams be grateful for

285
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,040
your teams

286
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,279
and recognize yourself keep a keep a win

287
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,399
sheet

288
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,279
and

289
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,040
share in your company slack channels

290
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,720
what you've done you know i did this

291
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,360
speaking i published this

292
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,519
um a lot of individuals from

293
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,959
underrepresented backgrounds are pretty

294
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,120
terrible at self-recognition but it is

295
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
critically important because if you

296
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,440
cannot advocate for yourself

297
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,720
like who else who else is going to so

298
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,640
be proud of your wins and and share them

299
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,160
second lesson i learned that was really

300
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,600
difficult was about boundaries

301
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,800
and i think this is something that many

302
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,399
of us struggle with because again we are

303
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,839
so committed to this work we care about

304
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,959
security

305
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,920
and there is so much to secure

306
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,280
um

307
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,600
[Music]

308
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,959
in my you know first year in the

309
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,800
leadership role i really learned the

310
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,160
hard way that you have to set time

311
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,519
boundaries

312
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,800
working with global teams working with

313
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,120
teams outside your own time zone

314
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,720
you really need to be pretty aggressive

315
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,959
about saying you know i take 8 p.m

316
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,560
meetings two nights a week not five

317
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,000
nights a week

318
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,279
you have to set emotional boundaries

319
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,040
there are things that you you know you

320
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,160
need to fix but you don't have

321
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
permission to spend the money to fix it

322
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,760
and i think that you need to create a

323
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,920
little bit of emotional space uh because

324
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,160
there are things that you cannot control

325
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,760
you need to set workload boundaries

326
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,800
which i'm going to speak to a little bit

327
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,959
more later and

328
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,200
do not let yourself be in a position

329
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,480
where your health

330
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,920
is not intended to you're not going to

331
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,000
the doctor you're not taking care of

332
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,160
yourself um because you're working so

333
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
much

334
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,000
uh there was one study i think was

335
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,160
published in racketeer that showed that

336
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,000
security teams are typically expected to

337
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,160
work 10 hours a week more than other

338
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,000
teams including other technical teams in

339
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,360
the organization

340
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
and i think that we need to recognize

341
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,399
that that's

342
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,000
not acceptable especially when it bleeds

343
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,200
into our personal lives and our health

344
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,440
and as we assume security leadership

345
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,399
roles

346
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,680
i think that we need to draw attention

347
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,600
to the fact that there is um

348
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,000
uneven standards for security team

349
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,959
um

350
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,399
i think a lot of organizations in

351
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,160
general struggle at recognizing

352
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,600
rewarding technical teams which can be

353
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,480
security and bit it can be uh product

354
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,200
developers engineers as well

355
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,639
so i think that we need to take

356
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,480
initiative and be really great at

357
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,600
recognizing technical contribution

358
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,000
in front of business leadership

359
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,720
and also i think as we hire

360
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
and kind of create teams

361
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,160
don't create a single point of failure

362
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,839
where somebody has to pick up the phone

363
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,600
in the middle of the night

364
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,920
make sure that you're on call rotations

365
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,440
are sufficiently staffed that people can

366
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,920
get sick they can take vacations

367
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,439
and they can have some work-life balance

368
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
this is a reference to a really great

369
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,839
talk i heard earlier this summer from

370
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,360
from jackie bo

371
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,639
at twitter

372
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,240
and she was talking about burnout and

373
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,720
she said that in herself she recognizes

374
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,920
that if she gets the point where

375
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,920
somebody comes to her with a a great

376
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,839
idea and she doesn't have the kind of

377
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,839
emotional bandwidth to say that's cool

378
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,120
let's talk about this she's so

379
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,720
overwhelmed that she

380
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,040
she feels you know frustrated

381
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,240
that's that's her sign of burnout and um

382
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,519
i feel like for me it's the same you

383
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,880
know if i'm not responding to my friends

384
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,160
on text if

385
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,880
if new ideas feel overwhelming to me

386
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,710
um i need to create some boundaries

387
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,480
[Music]

388
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,800
difficult lesson number three um emily

389
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,320
gladstone cole spoke about this quite a

390
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,279
bit

391
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,519
uh the relationship between security and

392
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,040
sales

393
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,920
it is definitely a frustrating one

394
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,839
but it's also a valuable one depending

395
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,880
on

396
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,120
how you you see it in the structure it

397
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,519
goes back to build creating

398
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,639
business partnerships with other leaders

399
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,199
customer trust is competitive currency

400
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,360
in today's just kind of business climate

401
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,800
in general

402
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,240
um

403
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,800
so i think that if you kind of

404
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,560
position yourself as an agent of

405
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,720
customer trust it it makes you a more

406
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,480
valuable member of the organization from

407
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,440
the business perspective

408
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
something that surprised me is the

409
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,040
amount of time i spent on those

410
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,560
questionnaires at emily reference as

411
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,720
well and redlining contracts

412
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,160
and that is something to be prepared for

413
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,440
for sure

414
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,519
i discovered in in my past role that

415
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,680
putting security into customer contracts

416
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,040
was a win

417
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,600
for for me because i was able to say you

418
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
know passing these audits or doing these

419
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,560
security things is an obligation to

420
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,120
you know 45 percent of our customers so

421
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,560
creating that business partnership where

422
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,320
i negotiated with the sales leadership

423
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,399
like put put security into customer

424
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,959
contracts as a value add

425
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,920
was beneficial to my to my team um and

426
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,480
the last thing i would point out is that

427
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,320
no matter how you feel about it

428
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,920
executives are always going to speak the

429
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,079
language of revenue i don't think that

430
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,320
revenue is by any means

431
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,959
the the most um

432
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,480
a descriptive language for security

433
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,320
impact but it is a language that they

434
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,440
speak risk and revenue

435
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,600
um i think that perceptions of security

436
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,519
as a cost center really need to evolve

437
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,440
and and partnering with sales is one way

438
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,800
that you can change that within your

439
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,920
organization i think that privacy in

440
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,680
general across the board in terms of

441
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,079
privacy regulations privacy legislation

442
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,120
is an area that needs to evolve

443
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,600
and that is an area that

444
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,880
i think businesses are struggling to

445
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,040
negotiate in their contracts

446
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,279
and last i would say that

447
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,360
manual approaches to reporting and risk

448
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,120
modeling and threat modeling

449
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,480
are no longer relevant

450
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,199
great risk reports are like a can of

451
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,880
korean mushroom they are fast cost

452
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,160
sensitive and condensed

453
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,480
difficult lesson number three

454
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,160
don't be too perfect and this goes back

455
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
to what i talked about previously where

456
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,759
a lot of people from underrepresented

457
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,639
backgrounds get into a leadership role

458
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,480
and they have a tendency to just

459
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,560
approach everything with just incredible

460
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,920
perfection

461
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,279
um

462
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,120
one of the hardest lessons i i learned

463
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
in in a prior job was that you have to

464
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,199
let stuff fall off your plate if you're

465
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,120
trying to get more hires

466
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,399
and leadership isn't approving it

467
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,560
you you can't keep pulling all-nighters

468
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,639
to do the work for them you should never

469
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,160
be doing that

470
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,079
and it does not make a very convincing

471
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,440
case for your hiring needs if you're

472
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,480
doing the work of three people

473
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,040
self-advocacy is not optional you have

474
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,560
to be very clear about here's where i

475
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,800
want to be in my career to your manager

476
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,240
um you have to be very clear about your

477
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,160
wins keep a detailed record of those

478
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,199
wins

479
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,040
because you are again your best advocate

480
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,279
and i think that um

481
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,839
you know the fact that

482
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,519
0.47 you know

483
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,560
um

484
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,120
percent of the of the workforce is

485
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,680
security is is untenable

486
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,920
we need to change the biases uh within

487
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,519
our organizations and we need to

488
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,600
completely change our mindset on talent

489
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,079
pipeline and figure out better ways to

490
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,480
engage entry-level professionals there's

491
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
a ton of mid-level and senior level

492
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,319
openings in security and there's a ton

493
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,839
of entry-level people who are trying to

494
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,799
break in

495
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,039
i think that organizations especially

496
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,119
large ones need to step up

497
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,559
and figure out better vocational

498
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,919
pathways that are apprenticeship

499
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,240
pathways and how we can better engage

500
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
kind of entry-level talent

501
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,839
to fix the security gap

502
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,360
and i think that employers need to

503
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,960
accept the fact

504
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,039
that helping grow your your security

505
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,400
professionals continuing learning for

506
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,720
security professionals is mandatory and

507
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,679
it should happen within work hours

508
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,400
on work budget

509
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,559
if you

510
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,559
hide your struggles if you are silently

511
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,799
doing to three people's jobs

512
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,559
or doing three people's jobs and not

513
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,720
asking for the hires you need

514
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,320
you can't create a healthier situation

515
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,520
for yourself

516
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,280
set those boundaries

517
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,799
let stuff fall off your plate it's

518
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,240
really hard but it's really important

519
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,720
learn to love frameworks such as sock 2.

520
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,840
what i learned about frameworks

521
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,760
frameworks are often where small

522
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,039
businesses startups which is where i've

523
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,640
spent my career

524
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
start investing in security customer

525
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,600
asks you to pass an audit you do it

526
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,320
but

527
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,919
compliance doesn't really get you to a

528
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,000
point where you're secure and so then as

529
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,880
a leader you need to justify spending

530
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,720
enough to get you to secure

531
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,360
beyond kind of the compliance level

532
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,440
that is where i chose to use frameworks

533
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,880
such as owasp sams and the nist

534
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,480
csf

535
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,160
to justify the difference between

536
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,480
compliance and mature

537
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,799
and start doing benchmarking and

538
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,799
creating kind of conversations where i

539
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,640
was seating ideas and nourishing them

540
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,160
with leadership my in my prior

541
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,320
organization around

542
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,960
um becoming more mature from a security

543
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,160
standpoint

544
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,440
i don't think that in security

545
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,080
leadership you can escape frameworks so

546
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,950
might as well embrace them

547
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,150
[Music]

548
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,640
and i think that as security

549
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,960
professionals we also have kind of a

550
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,679
responsibility to contribute to

551
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,080
frameworks such as wasp sams

552
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,440
and similar

553
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,679
to get frameworks to a place where

554
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,280
they meet our needs and they reflect

555
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,200
actual mature security best practice

556
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,120
there is definitely a gap

557
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,200
between frameworks such as

558
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,039
pci possibly pci dss and and maybe maybe

559
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,320
a hipaa a high-tech fedramp i'm not sure

560
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,880
and and what we should be doing because

561
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,960
actual development practice at cloud

562
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,480
native organizations such as the ones i

563
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,240
work at is evolving so quickly

564
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,120
i apologize for the deck issues

565
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
difficult lesson number five and this

566
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,480
speaks to

567
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,320
um the fact that sometimes you need to

568
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,640
kind of cut babe you can't really change

569
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,520
an adult's mind

570
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,760
as a security leader you are an internal

571
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,039
evangelist for security in your

572
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,120
organization

573
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,200
and you are responsible to an extent for

574
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,080
educating executives

575
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,679
i have learned from mentors that

576
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,919
spending a ton of time on budget

577
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,400
advocating for the budget you need

578
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,320
is inevitable for security leadership

579
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
you will live in powerpoint

580
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,840
and a huge part of your job will be

581
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,679
presenting information in ways that

582
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,000
resonates with the executive team

583
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,600
that said you cannot solely be

584
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
responsible for fixing the risks in your

585
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,440
beautiful power points

586
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,679
and it's not really your job to convince

587
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,919
anybody that security is a basic right

588
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,360
why you should be hitting the kind of

589
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,120
bare minimum standards for your

590
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,159
customers

591
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,559
that's not your job and if you're in

592
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,919
that position i think it's important to

593
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,600
honestly kind of evaluate whether or not

594
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,840
you're in the right place

595
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
what needs to change

596
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,039
i think that as an industry we need to

597
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,880
look at why c cells are lasting 11

598
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,960
months in positions

599
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,880
um and and make it to where um

600
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,080
the industry is a little bit more

601
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,320
tenable csos cannot be scapegoats for

602
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,880
risks they need to be risk partners

603
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,720
i think that we need to shift

604
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,080
organizational thinking to where

605
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,640
security is responsible for risk to

606
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,799
um the fact that security is everybody's

607
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,600
responsibility in business

608
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
and i think that the kind of office the

609
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,039
cso structure

610
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,280
where there's multiple security leaders

611
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,640
is going to become increasingly

612
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,640
important

613
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,080
i have a disclaimer in the notes of this

614
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,480
deck which i will share um to my boss

615
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,919
i'm not personally looking for a new job

616
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,600
but i think in general just kind of

617
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,440
blanket advice for everybody as soon as

618
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,720
you get a new job start looking for your

619
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,000
next one

620
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,640
you are your own best advocate and it's

621
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,559
not your job to

622
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,159
change an adult's mind if you've hit the

623
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,520
point where you cannot convince a

624
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,200
company to invest any more in security

625
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,440
so i went through a job search in the

626
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,919
last few months and landed at it at a

627
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,360
company that i'm

628
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,200
very happy with

629
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,640
however

630
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,799
i think it is incredibly important to be

631
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,640
picky during a job search this is a job

632
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,840
seekers market you have more choice than

633
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,919
ever here are some actual

634
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,280
red flags that i encountered in my

635
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,039
recent job search

636
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,520
um i received an email from a company um

637
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,039
asking to interview me that said that

638
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,880
they had data on several million

639
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
children which were the customers

640
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,480
and they were just considering creating

641
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,120
a security program with one person

642
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
who'd also be responsible for the

643
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,640
privacy of these children's data that

644
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,799
was terrifying

645
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:35,840
um

646
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,080
it was another um

647
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,280
this wasn't a specific thing that

648
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,320
somebody said i think it's more a

649
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,159
reflection of the fact that

650
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,679
job descriptions and security can be

651
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,320
absolutely ridiculous

652
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,960
where they want to pay almost nothing

653
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,159
and and get somebody with you know

654
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,600
assist but jd

655
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,960
and

656
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,480
these incredible ab sex skills

657
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,640
startups um like to promise

658
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,159
raises after a certain amount of time

659
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,000
i think that you should make the wage

660
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,280
that you deserve to make from day one

661
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,360
and a final red flag which is pretty

662
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,320
common

663
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,640
is that security is not reporting into

664
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,080
the c-suite this is something you should

665
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,480
run away with or run away from

666
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,640
especially if you're looking at security

667
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
leadership roles you need to have a

668
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,080
direct path

669
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,120
um

670
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,960
to advocate for your needs

671
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,640
you do not want to be reporting into an

672
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,320
i.t manager you don't want to be

673
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,080
reporting into a vp of product because

674
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,000
not only does this mean you have to go

675
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,559
through several layers to you know

676
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,400
get permission from the cfo to buy the

677
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,600
tools that you need it also means that

678
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,679
there's typically a conflict of interest

679
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,039
when it comes to compliance and privacy

680
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,840
when i started my job search i had this

681
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,159
attitude of you know i'll take any

682
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,960
interview it's good experience

683
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,480
and i don't think that advice stands in

684
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,000
this market anymore

685
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,200
you're going to get a lot of interviews

686
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,799
if you're job searching

687
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,960
um you know perhaps especially if you

688
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,159
have the years of experience to be a

689
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,919
security leader you're getting a lot of

690
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,679
interest in your resume

691
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,440
and if a company is emailing you saying

692
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,200
let's set up an interview we have data

693
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,480
on several million children and no

694
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,600
security

695
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,080
you do not need to say yes

696
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,710
you should run away

697
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,000
[Music]

698
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,520
before we kind of transition into the

699
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,799
crockpot pot part of this talk

700
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,720
um i wanted to kind of offer a few

701
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,919
reminders to everybody in the audience

702
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,159
you are a security leader leadership is

703
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,760
not the same as management you do not

704
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,000
need a manager title director title of

705
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,200
vp title cso title to be a leader

706
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,400
i think that

707
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,679
people in security uh often fight really

708
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,840
really really hard to break in

709
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,440
they have incredible initiative outside

710
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,919
of work to do continuing learning

711
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,840
and we're often people who are kind of

712
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,120
unafraid of doing unpopular things

713
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,039
so i think that people in in security

714
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,279
are often fantastic leaders within

715
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,360
organizations whether or not they have a

716
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,679
leader title

717
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,400
um another reminder you deserve healthy

718
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,080
uh healthy boundary boundaries

719
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,080
recognition and fair pay you do not have

720
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,640
to put up with a job that does not

721
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,320
allow you to create good work-life

722
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,559
balance

723
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,720
as somebody who speaks to a lot of

724
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,120
underrepresented people in security

725
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,880
you're probably underrepresented or

726
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,480
underestimating yourself

727
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,400
i hear so many signs of imposter

728
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,559
syndrome on a daily basis

729
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,360
um

730
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,200
be proud of who you are and what you've

731
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,720
accomplished

732
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,880
and be confident in the fact that all of

733
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,320
us are contributing

734
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,880
to a more secure and equitable future

735
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,640

human right

737
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,640
i just spilled my coffee

738
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,679
and uh data breaches are inevitable or

739
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,230
not inevitable they're unlikely

anything before i

make the jump

uh there are some but we're having an

746
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,480
issue actually with your uh sound being

747
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
desynced so we're we're trying to work

748
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,440
on that so i'm so sorry oh no it's not

749
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
on we don't think it's on your end

750
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,760
okay

751
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,559
crockpots are a severely underrated

752
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,720
appliance i live in a very small city

753
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,919
apartment

754
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,840
i don't have a ton of kitchen appliances

755
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,480
but i do have a crock pot and i use it a

756
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,799
lot they are really pretty cheap

757
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,400
um i think especially compared to

758
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
instant pots and and

759
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,559
things like that um and they are great

760
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,400
for small kitchens

761
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,240
the other thing i adore about crop box

762
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,960
pots is the fact they are so forgiving

763

kind of recipes and food um this is not

773

classy

775
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,520
the recipes i'm going to share do have

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,760
animal products i have made very

784
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,320
because i ran out of time i did not put

785
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,600
them in github but i will share this

786

molly yay is a um has a show on food

788
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,000
network and there was one time when she

789
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,399
was discussing a casserole and made a

790
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,760
joke about

791
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,919
um kind of like an ex axis of how

792
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,559
delicious the casserole is and why being

793
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,720
how much it looked like throw up

794
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
i apologize if i've like offended or

795
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,320
bothered anybody here but i i feel like

796
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,559
this is relevant to the food that i

797
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,840
make in my crock pot that's slow effort

798
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840
a lot of it is extremely delicious and

799
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,030
also has a huge resemblance to to vom

800
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,440
[Music]

801
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,320
here is one that is ultimately delicious

802
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,120
and resembles vom to a very great degree

803
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,679
a wild rice hot dish which i believe is

804
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,840
the state dish of minnesota

805
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,760
since wild rice is the state grain of

806
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,279
minnesota

807
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,760
it involves cream of mushroom and wild

808
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,320
rice and again i'll share these recipes

809
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,080
ground beef which could easily be

810
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,399
substituted for

811
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,399
beyond beef and a few other ingredients

812
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,159
another recipe i make pretty often is

813
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,720
kind of a bean corn and chicken soup

814
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,399
uh there's a lot of cans that go into

815
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,480
this cans of beans corn olives tomatoes

816
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,520
um

817
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,960
but this is a recipe that you can

818
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,679
definitely just kind of walk away from

819
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,520
you just dump it everything in at one

820
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,480
time

821
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,240
which i will often do if i have 10

822
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,399
minutes between zoom calls and forget

823
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,530
about it for hours

i may have underestimated the the

826
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,760
resemblance to follow this dish when i

827
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,919
was placing it on the the yay model

828
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,799
uh cabbage soup um is another one that i

829
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,039
make a lot in winter

830
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,440
it's got beef and kind of veggies

831
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,720
and some kidney beans as well

832
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,559
tater tot hot dish um

833
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,039
is a very classic casserole

834
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,799
not often made in the crock pot but i

835
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,480
have mastered that

836
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,159
if my day is light and it has not

837
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,240
completely gone off the rails yet i will

838
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,080
sometimes bake the tater tots a little

839
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,919
bit before i put it on for kind of a

840
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,279
crispier

841
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,399
top of my dish

842
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,880
not mandatory you can just dump

843
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,159
everything in the crock pot and walk

844
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,600
away as well

845
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,440
and i have read on reddit because i hang

846
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,039
out on reddit minnesota and google

847
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,880
casserole sometimes or look up

848
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,039
casseroles that

849
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,919
if you want to take a creme brulee

850
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,720
torch and and brown the top of your

851
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,039
tater tots that that is

852
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,840
one way you can kind of exceed

853
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,799
exceed the the mean on your tater tot

854
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,799
hot dish

855
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,120
the last one this is not something

856
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,360
i am personally willing to eat my

857
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,440
partner is from the midwest he loves it

858
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,760
he loves it on football game days uh

859
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,799
rotel depp three ingredients velveeta

860
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,399
highly polarizing processed cheese

861
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,240
ground beef which could be substituted

862
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,360
for

863
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,559
beyond beef

864
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,279
and rotel tomatoes

865
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,320
i

866
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,559
will note this is the only recipe that i

867
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,200
uh do not have dairy-free vegan

868
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,679
substitutes for because um i think that

869
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,679
it would require a fair amount of

870
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,360
culinary skill

871
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,799
in order to

872
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,640
kind of use butternut squash or similar

873
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,960
to to make a fake velveeta but i'd be

874
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,960
very interested in anybody who manages

875
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,520
to do so

876
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,960
kind of wrapping up

877
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,360
wanted to give credit to a few people

878
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,760

professors

886
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,080
my organization's designer chum created

887
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,600
this template that i proceeded to

888
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,039
desecrate with my terrible graphic

889
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,880
design skills

890
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,600
my partner cam uh is is a very

891
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,360
supportive human he always eats my um

892
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,679
my recipes even when the kind of vom

893
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,919
resemblance outweighs the deliciousness

894
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,919
and he got me breakfast this morning

895
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,760
and then i wanted to thank my my new

896

supportive um

898
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,840
and you know supported me being here

899
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,120
and really kind of quick um

900
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,640
wanted to highlight a few ways that i

901
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,159
would love to collaborate with everybody

902

905
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,360
jupiterone.com for a copy as well if

906
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,840
that is is for whatever reason um a

907
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,679
better method

908
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,760
uh the the report i'm working on the the

909
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,000
scar report this uh the state of cyber

910
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,200
assets report

911
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,760
i am looking for practitioner reviewers

912
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,519
for this report

913
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,919
it is about 55 pages including a lot of

914
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,320
graphs

915
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,559
and i am giving the opportunity for

916
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,760
people to

917
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,000
kind of be listed as an editor on this

918
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,120
report and you can obviously kind of

919
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,760
make that decision after you review it

920
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,279
whether you want to be credited as an

921
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,880
editor or not

922
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,799
so please reach out to me if you might

923
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:37,840
be willing to kind of look at the

924
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,760
research of again it's almost 400

925
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,960
million cyber assets

926
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,880
and i would really love it if people

927
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,279
tweeted pictures of food or crock pots

928
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,760
to me as well i met jasmine henry10 on

929
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,080
twitter

930
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,320
bryce and that was actually my last

931
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,519
slide

932
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,480
i kind of felt the natural flow there so

933
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,159
uh first question classic

934
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,440
uh

935
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,159
the

936
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,600
slide axes for your

937
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,679
measurement of meals how did you come up

938
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,640
with that

939
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,679
so again it's a reference to a joke that

940
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,320
the um kind of food network

941
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,200
star molly yay made in passing where she

942
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,440
was she was referencing the kind of wild

943
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,120
rice hot dish as well

944
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,960
um and she said you know if there was a

945
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,000
y-axis for resemblance to vomit and how

946
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,240
x-axis how delicious it was

947
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,080
this one would max it out

948
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,600
um and i i really concur

949
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,320
so my only contribution to this was

950
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,440
visualizing it and abusing her framework

951
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
i i thought that was a really clever use

952
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,559
um

953
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,480
on the slack channel we had somebody who

954
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,640
recommended that uh they are

955
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,840
colloquially known as slop

956
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,120
okay

957
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,240
i really enjoy learning new

958
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,480
kind of regional references to hot

959
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,799
dishes and casseroles so i appreciate

960
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,159
that

961
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,480
is there a link to the study that notes

962
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,960
that security works 10 hours more per

963
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,880
week than other teams

964
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,079
yes i can find that in

965
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,679
i'm not going to look it up right now

966
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,199
but i will certainly link it alongside

967
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,399
the slides

968
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,239
within about 10 minutes of finishing up

969
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,199
here

970
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,359
okay because i i have referenced that

971
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,719
myself and i think it's important for us

972
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,280
to draw recognition to this

973
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,359
uh you mentioned on the slides that one

974
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,879
of the challenges of course is

975
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,199
unreasonable okrs

976
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,679
uh but isn't part of the challenge that

977
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,239
okrs are kind of like push down on us

978
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,560
and then at the same time that managers

979
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,239
themselves don't get the training to put

980
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,119
in place good okrs

981
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,560
right um

982
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,000
yeah i mean it's it's definitely a

983
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,800
difficult situation so um

984
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,839
you know i think that

985
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,480
there's different things we can do you

986
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,879
know if if you're looking at for a job

987
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,560
and and somebody's looking for a cso

988
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,640
who's going to personally do like audits

989
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,119
and pen testing and stuff like

990
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,800
just don't take those jobs

991
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,000
like don't reward people who have

992
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,920
unreasonable expectations

993
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,320
um and as well i think that

994
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,000
taking a really active role in building

995
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,240
okrs for yourself for your for your team

996
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,839
pushing back on okrs that are passed

997
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:14,800
down

998
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,440
is really key um because we have to

999
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,720
educate

1000
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,480
our you know kind of business leadership

1001
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,240
about the realities of security work

1002
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,320
they have no idea i think especially

1003
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,480
since the work that we do has evolved so

1004
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,079
quickly as we've moved to kind of cloud

1005
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,520
native infrastructures like 10 years ago

1006
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,800
there wasn't a guard duty that was

1007
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,520
generating 6000 alerts a day

1008
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,280
and we need to be

1009
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,960
i think kind of at the helm of educating

1010
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,720
leaders about how much security has

1011
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,680
changed and what we need to do it

1012
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,400
successfully

1013
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
do you see a difference in the kinds of

1014
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,800
leadership challenges between a startup

1015
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,440
and a large enterprise

1016
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,200
yes

1017
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,280
i do i do that all the time i'm like yes

1018
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,440
that's your answer

1019
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,079
i think that um

1020
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,160
there's no guarantee on either side of

1021
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,599
the fence that you are going to have

1022
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,920
executive support for security

1023
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,440
um you know obviously skill

1024
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,040
skilled security team is going to affect

1025
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,240
what you're dealing with on a day-to-day

1026
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,680
basis

1027
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,839
but when i talk to you know security

1028
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,280
people at companies that are wildly

1029
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,359
different size than mine i'm i'm amazed

1030
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,599
at how much the same stuff we're dealing

1031
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,680
with like oh i'm you know creating this

1032
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,359

1033
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,680
for like my hiring needs i spent a lot

1034
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
of my time dealing with budget um i

1035
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,320
think there's a lot that is shared in

1036
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,920
common experience

1037
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
um but life is much better when you're

1038
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,680
at an organization of any size and value

1039
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,680
security

1040
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
