basically two parts of this talk today

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,279
uh stop committing your secrets and

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,640
improv skills everywhere like just got

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,640
introduced uh talk about stop committing

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,399
your secrets part first and we'll finish

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,079
it up with improv if you got questions

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,920
for me throw them out in the

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,360
chat on the

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,000
uh the room two chat and

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,360
we'll get to them hopefully at the end

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,200
if we get a little bit of time i do i am

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,800
a little verbose in my speaking so we

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,480
might not get a lot of question time but

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,039
i'll do my best uh so i'm duane um i

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,320
work for a company called get cracking

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
these days developer evangelist i live

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,920
here in chicago about a mile straight

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,280
south of wrigley

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,480
uh

30
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,600
that's about all you need to know about

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,680
that um get kraken is company that makes

32
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,160
git tools uh you'll see

33
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,640
one of them just by happenstance today

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,438
uh

35
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,000
the get cracking client the visualize

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,520
stuff we also make um get lens an open

37
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,560
source project on the vs code realm that

38
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,000
helps people see their commit histories

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,840
better and get integration for jira

40
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,439
which does just what it says on the box

41
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,240
if you're using jira makes it easier to

42
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,200
uh

43
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,439
to your git histories and whatnot

44
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,280
so what the heck is a git talk doing

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,159
here at pancak pancakes con 3

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,280
um

47
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,479
most people don't think security

48
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,479
immediately when they think of git

49
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,400
uh but maybe we should be thinking about

50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,280
that

51
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,439
we all use git on the regular

52
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,600
um and all of our projects end up out in

53
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,159
public spaces so people can access them

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,799
the code for those projects end up

55
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,799
mostly in private repos

56
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,040
but unfortunately they're

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,159
not all private repos unfortunately a

58
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,159
lot of secrets

59
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,640
end up in the hands of the wrong people

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,200
according to get guardian

61
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,960
uh it's a lot

62
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,799
there's two million detected just in the

63
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,799
year 2020 alone and they see that

64
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,038
growing not shrinking even though there

65
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,959
are some awesome things built into

66
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,440
github and git lab and other tools out

67
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,840
there to say hey you got a secret here

68
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,720
by the time they detect it out publicly

69
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,879
uh someone else might have as well

70
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,120
so that's what today's talk is really

71
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,239
all about

72
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,080
is the fact that you can have

73
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,280
bulletproof security with an army behind

74
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,480
it to

75
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,160
keep you from

76
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,400
getting compromised and do all the pen

77
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,920
testing you want but if someone leaves a

78
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,760
key out front

79
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,120
under a rock

80
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,640
you're probably going to get compromised

81
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
at some point now no one's going to be

82
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,239
dumb enough to do this

83
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,720
obviously but this is a real thing that

84
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,400
happened in the world

85
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,720
if you have never taken a look at some

86
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,800
of the locksmith accounts on the

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,040
internet i would highly recommend it uh

88
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,800
you think

89
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,959
infosec has security problems

90
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,120
actual physical space has a lot of weird

91
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,800
security problems that you might not

92
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800
think about off top your head but

93
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,800
they think about it a lot and post

94
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,879
things like this so i don't actually

95
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,560
blame the people that did this look at

96
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,959
that code that is an annoyingly long

97
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,920
code

98
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,519
i would have problems remembering it and

99
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,959
unless there's like gold on the other

100
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,480
side of that door or you know high

101
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,239
infos uh secrets

102
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,200
uh uh top secret stuff like if it's just

103
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,840
the supply room to get the pens i might

104
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,480
do the same thing myself it's not a good

105
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,680
idea in fact it's a flat out bad idea

106
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,440
but it's a convenient idea it's

107
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,360
something that we did for expediency

108
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,720
like we just got to get in and get the

109
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,840
staples get back out okay nobody got

110
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,120
time to go

111
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,879
look around for what is that stupid long

112
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,680
code we put on the door

113
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,120
and we do this in code all the time

114
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,640
especially when we're debugging

115
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,519
especially when we're just like testing

116
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,360
things like does this endpoint actually

117
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
even work

118
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,159
sure i know i should go set up my

119
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,959
secrets folder sure i know i should go

120
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,239
um

121
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,560
do it the right way every single time

122
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,360
but sometimes i just need to quickly

123
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,280
verify that service is up at the other

124
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,040
end and there are all sorts of tools to

125
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
help me do that like postman and

126
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,639
other things out there even like simple

127
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,399
scripts that never get into my code base

128
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,800
to test those things but let's be honest

129
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,000
sometimes

130
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,199
i used to do this in drupal and

131
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,960
wordpress sites all the time i'm just

132
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,800
gonna hard code it in there just to make

133
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,919
sure it works and i'll take it out later

134
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,360
uh the problem though is that

135
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,000
it's very easy to forget we did that as

136
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,919
we're moving along and working on other

137
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,280
things in our code

138
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,759
and okay i got that working now let's go

139
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,280
make sure something else is working oh i

140
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,800
found just got to solve this one little

141
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
thing down here

142
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and in the middle of all that

143
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,680
we've all had it happen to us we get

144
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
that slack message or email

145
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,199
it's like hey

146
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,120
such and such is on fire and we gotta go

147
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,600
put it out or hey the client moved up

148
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,080
the deadline we need all hands on deck

149
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,199
right now

150
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,440
to go solve this thing

151
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,639
uh

152
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,080
and what do you do you don't lose your

153
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,960
work

154
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,919
and you're working in git so

155
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,680
you add you commit

156
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,479
and you let it sit there or you stash it

157
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,639
and you change branches or if you're

158
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,800
working in an advanced setup you uh with

159
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,320
advanced workflows you're checking out a

160
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,479
work tree moving over to that branch

161
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,560
just in another directory and doing your

162
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,199
work getting that like okay we fixed the

163
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,440
fix the fire we did the hotfix and then

164
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,800
come back and we're no longer on line

165
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,440
eight or nine in our ide

166
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,680
we're online like 180 looking at

167
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,759
something completely unrelated

168
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,000
and it's easy to forget it's easy to

169
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,919
lose track that hey i hard coded a

170
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,639
secret in there

171
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,199
now get itself

172
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,960
is pretty awesome and for those of you

173
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,720
out there that might not be super

174
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,120
familiar with git um just a super quick

175
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,880
recap of what it's actually all about

176
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,080
and what it does

177
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,280
uh and then we'll go back to talking

178
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,000
about the security issues of it

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,080
but get just take snapshots of your work

180
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,440
over time

181
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,400
this is from the get book get get dash

182
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,240
sem

183
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,759
if you haven't read that yet it's a very

184
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,840
boring read i highly recommend skipping

185
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,199
chapter two

186
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,880
but there's a lot of awesome information

187
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,240
and graphics in it

188
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,440
so

189
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,199
as you're working you can just take the

190
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,240
snapshot store that long term and get

191
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,319
and doesn't forget anything even the

192
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,080
stuff you think you forgot it didn't

193
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,120
forget

194
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,319
uh

195
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,800
not for at least 30 days

196
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,639
there's all sorts of ways to get back at

197
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,680
that

198
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,600
although snapchats get stacked up one on

199
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,000
top of each other turn into a graph what

200
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
we think of a graph view you often hear

201
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,759
that get itself is a graphical based

202
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,720
uh protocol or set of set of ways to

203
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,039
store things that's very true if you can

204
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,680
map things over graphs that's one of the

205
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,080
things that our tool get cracking of the

206
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
cracking client does uh pretty

207
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,759
beautifully in my opinion

208
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,560
um the other thing git does that is

209
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,880
gives you real superpowers is lets you

210
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,000
make parallel dimensions in time travel

211
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,039
uh it sounds a little bit silly but

212
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,800
i'm really glad this the marvel

213
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,479
cinematic universe

214
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,160
is implementing uh the multiverse at

215
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,520
this point

216
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,960
because i think in the long run it's

217
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,479
going to help people wrap their heads

218
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,440
around some of the concepts of git

219
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,240
uh

220
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,880
again a little bit silly but also true

221
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,160
the fact that you can have these

222
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,759
parallel branching

223
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,039
streams

224
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,759
and all of them are real all of them

225
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,680
can be messed around and all of them can

226
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,440
be traveled too

227
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,039
but it doesn't move just forward in time

228
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,560
you can also move backwards in time as

229
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,919
we saw in ant-man and uh

230
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
the avenger movies the um

231
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,639
the end games anyway that's enough

232
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,960
diatribe about marvel uh

233
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,199
so get is all this awesome stuff and it

234
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,479
let's keep track of things forever and

235
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,080
gives you a way to collaborate with

236
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,680
others and share those snapshots and

237
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,199
manipulate it

238
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,319
but

239
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,720
it doesn't actually deal with security

240
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,160
in and of itself it is an awesome way to

241
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,840
source control mana or manage your

242
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,240
source code or version control all of

243
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,520
your stuff

244
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,000
but to get every file

245
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,680
is the same it's going to treat

246
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,400
everything no matter if it's a dot js or

247
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,440
a dot c or a dot h or a

248
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,560
dot p

249
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,720
python or dot whatever you call it it

250
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,240
just think hey there's a bunch of text

251
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,320
in a file if it's not a bunch of text in

252
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,880
a file and it's just a blob a binary log

253
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,640
object

254
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,240
it's going to say okay i'm tracking that

255
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,519
too that's cool it's just a bunch of

256
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,919
ones and zeros in a file i got it

257
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,679
and it's going to treat it all the same

258
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,160
uh git after all is the stupid content

259
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,240
tracker if you ever

260
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,600
want to see the sense of humor of the

261
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
linux crew that started building git

262
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,480
back in 2005 just start looking at the

263
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,240
manual there's all sorts of weird little

264
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,120
references to gets dumb it is a stupid

265
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,519
content tracker it does exactly what you

266
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,800
tell it no more no less and

267
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,920
that's good

268
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,680
and it's also horrifying

269
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,160
um a git does provide a way out of the

270
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,200
box

271
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,880
to

272
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,519
not track things and hopefully this is a

273
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,200
brand new information hopefully everyone

274
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,480
on here has already heard of a git

275
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,360
ignore file if not um

276
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,680
you can simply make a file a git ignore

277
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,160
file and say hey get don't pay attention

278
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,959
to these things don't ever actually

279
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,399
track these things when i commit

280
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,560
something don't put this in that commit

281
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,839
for long-term storage

282
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,720
uh

283
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,560
and if we all just

284
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,480
put all of our secrets

285
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,600
in files that were tracked with

286
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,800
get ignore

287
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,120
um

288
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,399
that would kind of be the end of the

289
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,279
talk but um

290
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,279
also before i move on

291
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,279
uh hopefully someone's explained this

292
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,800
this is no time in today's talk to

293
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,440
explain like why you use the

294
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,519
secrets.json and what that's all about

295
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,120
uh but the short answer is never

296
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,200
hardcode your api keys into your code

297
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,440
ever if you can at all help it i know

298
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,360
it's so tempting to do that

299
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,720
but

300
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
again i wouldn't be giving this talk if

301
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,480
people didn't actually do this on the

302
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
regular i know i have done it

303
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,880
uh way too many times to admit

304
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,440
um in a perfect world i would just never

305
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,800
do it

306
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,519
i would use git ignore and move about my

307
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,360
day and everybody be safe but if we

308
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,800
think back to those numbers from the get

309
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,640
report there's at least two million

310
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,160
secrets out there

311
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,079
way more probably at this point you know

312
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,519
two years after that report got made

313
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,560
and if you commit something locally it's

314
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,760
not

315
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,959
it's not the end of the world because

316
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,320
you've just committed it locally you can

317
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,839
pull it out of the repo and no one will

318
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,720
ever

319
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,320
ever see it

320
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,120
but if you commit it and then push it

321
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,360
uh you're gonna have a bad time

322
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,120
because once it's pushed

323
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,640
it's

324
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,880
it's in a state where it's gonna be

325
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,040
painful to get it back out

326
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,440
uh now you can remove things from public

327
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,200
repos and from private repos uh and go

328
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,040
do anything to the graph you want that's

329
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,800
the one of the super awesome powers

330
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,920
about git you have full control

331
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,000
over that graph

332
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,519
that you can go and manipulate it

333
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,240
however you see fit

334
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,560
but when you push it public

335
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,800
well

336
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,959
other people are gonna know about that

337
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,800
and now it's no longer hey i did this on

338
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,959
my own oopsy i fixed it

339
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,360
uh now you gotta go probably ask someone

340
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,519
for permission to go manipulate the

341
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,680
entire repo at once now your

342
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,079
fingerprints are gonna be all over old

343
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,200
commits

344
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,720
now it's going to start

345
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,320
getting a lot of eyeballs on you and a

346
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,279
lot of

347
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,120
strange questions on like well why did

348
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,720
you do that

349
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,240
so when i say painful i don't mean

350
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,440
technically painful it isn't easy

351
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,800
it's a little bit tricky you got to do

352
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,079
some pretty deep get foo to make it work

353
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,000
um

354
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,240
now once it is pushed public there are a

355
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
bunch of tools that can help you with

356
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,959
this static code tool analysis our

357
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,079
static code analysis tools sonarlint um

358
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,760
github advanced security automatically

359
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,720
does this

360
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,240
we'll go through and look for things

361
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,760
that like hey that looks like a key and

362
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,959
tell you

363
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,519
but by the time it's gotten there

364
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,519
it's kind of already too late

365
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,680
um if you've ever cloned something and

366
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,959
like i'm just going to push this over

367
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,120
here it was easier to push it public so

368
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,000
i could share it with someone else

369
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,440
that's where a lot of these secrets get

370
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,560
leaked where we didn't mean to but it

371
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,519
accidentally popped out there

372
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,000
so what we really want at the end of all

373
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,120
of this is some code of autonomaton a

374
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,959
robot if you will

375
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,079
that will say hey stop doing that

376
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,440
don't commit that thing

377
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,560
and git provides a way to do this um git

378
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,360
has built in it since the beginning

379
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
uh inside the git folder that's what

380
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,639
you're looking at here

381
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,480
if you've never looked inside a git

382
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,880
folder highly recommend it it helps you

383
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
wrap your head around what's going on

384
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,320
especially with things like head

385
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,120
uh head is not a scary folder to look

386
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,680
into at all i'm going to jump over to

387
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,880
uh vs code real quick and look in my git

388
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,320
folder and if you look at like your

389
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,279
head

390
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,120
head is one line long

391
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,720
head simply

392
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,639
tells get what you're pointing at so

393
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,240
every time you see a message of like

394
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,839
detached head

395
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,360
it just means head's no longer pointing

396
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,639
to the top of the graph that's all that

397
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,880
means so once you start digging around

398
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,639
in here and realize what's in these

399
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,959
files git becomes a lot less

400
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,120
scary a lot less

401
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
onerous and less like oh it's just a

402
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,279
bunch of text files keeping track of

403
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,880
where

404
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,279
i am in my commit log that's all it

405
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,680
really does except for this hooks folder

406
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,040
hooks

407
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,519
is a pretty awesome system that lets you

408
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,720
build your own rube goldberg devices

409
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,480
if you don't know rube goldberg uh this

410
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,800
is from wikipedia that picture uh rube

411
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,720
goldberg drew these awesome drawings

412
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
back in the 20s and 40s

413
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,240
that showed all of these crazy

414
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,560
contraptions the you know did this then

415
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,199
do that it's he imagined the world of if

416
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,199
then than that or zapier

417
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,040
or however you want to glue things

418
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,079
together

419
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,440
um and presented it in a comical way and

420
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,680
so these over-elaborate things

421
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,680
so you can build all of the elaborate

422
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,760
contraptions and if then that devices

423
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,199
you want

424
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,440
inside of git pretty straightforward to

425
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,519
do it too

426
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,240
so

427
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
git actually comes with a bunch of

428
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,800
samples so if you go look at a

429
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,959
a get hooks folder

430
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,399
you'll see all of these things dot

431
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,519
sample

432
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,880
when you start looking around on it it's

433
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,440
like okay i can see it's a shell script

434
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,880
and then

435
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,720
oh it starts getting complicated pretty

436
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,160
quick because what the heck is get

437
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
revparse

438
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,519
it's a good thing to know i'm not gonna

439
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,079
lie uh but i'm not here to teach it to

440
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,240
you either um get hash object like what

441
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,000
on earth is that we start getting into

442
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,480
the porcelain i'm sorry the plumbing of

443
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,959
git uh if you look at the get command

444
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,079
line

445
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,279
program

446
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,279
um there's two parts there's a part

447
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,880
called the porcelain which is what we

448
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,560
normally deal with and then there's the

449
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,000
plumbing everything underneath it

450
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,839
something like rev parse and git hash

451
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,760
live in the plum are in the poor spot

452
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
live in the plumbing deep below the

453
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,600
porcelain porcelain things like git add

454
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
and git commit higher level commands

455
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
that do a bunch of lower level commands

456
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
just packaged up don't have to worry

457
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,199
about them

458
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,880
anyway um

459
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,720
this all gets really confusing really

460
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,199
fast unless you live and get day in day

461
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,959
out i'm fortunate enough to have a

462
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,560
career that has pushed me in that

463
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,240
direction and i think about git way too

464
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,040
much

465
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,120
um but unless you're somebody that does

466
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,279
that and lives and thinks about

467
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,000
scripting a lot or your linus himself

468
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,160
let's never forget that git came out of

469
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,720
linus torvald's brain trying to manage

470
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,279
linux patches that's where it came from

471
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,440
so unless you're trying to build the git

472
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,600
kernel and manage a bunch of patches

473
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,000
people are submitted to you parts of git

474
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,040
might not be obvious the linus it was to

475
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,600
uh you maybe not so much but there's

476
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,199
plenty of documentation and never be

477
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,880
scared you can't really blow up again

478
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,279
instance um you can but you can always

479
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,199
get back to where you're going

480
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,680
but anyway git hooks

481
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,360
they might look scary and like what on

482
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,759
earth is going on here um but if you

483
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,560
strip all that away git hooks are just

484
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,000
scripts

485
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,360
that's all they are

486
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,120
that trigger at a very specific instance

487
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,480
in the get

488
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,839
process

489
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:38,959
so here

490
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,360
every time i go a commit message gets

491
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,839
written actually i succeed in making a

492
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,040
commit message happen into the log

493
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,399
i insert

494
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,880
uh i can has dad joke so if you're not

495
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,360
familiar with icanhasdadjoke.com

496
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,199
it's an awesome api you can hit and a

497
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,160
website

498
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,880
that

499
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,240
spits out a

500
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
dad joke so in this case uh why did the

501
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,480
teddy bear say no to dessert because he

502
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,119
was stuffed terrible joke they're all

503
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,160
terrible but it's fun it's fun to have

504
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,079
bad jokes in your logs you can go back

505
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,400
and no matter how mad you are upset

506
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,240
about something dumb you did a few

507
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,839
commits ago at least you got that dad

508
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,839
joke to cheer you up that's my theory

509
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,159
anyway

510
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,640
but you can have uh any language you

511
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
want i personally love bash i grew up

512
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
writing it so

513
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,079
it's my go-to if i need to do a thing

514
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,320
real quick but javascript python

515
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,480
whatever as long as

516
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,160
you can evaluate

517
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,320
to that environment and actually execute

518
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,240
that script as an executable um you're

519
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,080
good to go so

520
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,520
there's no limit on what you can do with

521
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,120
this

522
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,640
so if we think back to the problem we

523
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,080
have all right what i want to do i want

524
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,520
to stop committing

525
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
code so i'm going to say hey computer

526
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
every time i commit check my code for

527
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,280
any username and passwords api keys

528
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,960
security certificates

529
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,400
and any other credentials that i might

530
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,080
define and if any of those are detected

531
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,840
just throw an error and don't let me

532
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,039
make that commit just stop things

533
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,200
this actually isn't that difficult on

534
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,880
the surface

535
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,720
again there are a bunch of hooks we can

536
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,640
connect to or hook into

537
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,600
uh

538
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,400
these all apply to the are all come from

539
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,919
the uh get porcelain i was talking about

540
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,120
earlier

541
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,240
so whenever you do a thing in git

542
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,080
there's a bunch of sub things that

543
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
probably are happening

544
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
along the path it's saying hey go look

545
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,480
in the git folder see if

546
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,720
in the hooks folder there is something

547
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,880
called like pre-commit or post checkout

548
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,320
or update or

549
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
you know post rewrite if something's

550
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,240
there go run that before we move on to

551
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,880
the next step or this process

552
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
uh there's a wonderful website matthew

553
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
hudson has put together git hooks that

554
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,600
explains this all very succinctly very

555
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,360
well um

556
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,880
i highly recommend going checking that

557
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,280
out as you dig into this further

558
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,840
but for our purposes for this

559
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,440
talk and for this set of exercises um

560
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
we care about those three hooks that

561
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,200
trigger before a commit actually happens

562
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
so pre-commit prepare commit message and

563
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,280
commit message

564
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,600
you can put it at any one of those a

565
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,240
pre-commit is the earliest one prepare

566
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,080
commit message is the second earliest

567
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,840
and commit message is the third one that

568
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,880
gets it's executed overall so building

569
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,400
on ourselves would look something like

570
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,280
this

571
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,799
um if

572
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,760
uh

573
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
this regular expression that's what this

574
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,320
line means um get grep minus e that just

575
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,080
says evaluate this as a regular

576
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,480
expression regex good old regex it's

577
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,400
terrifying and awesomely powerful at the

578
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,520
same time um if that's true or that's

579
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,400
true

580
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,360
then

581
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,320
spit out an error message and exit um

582
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
same thing is if i have something that

583
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,720
is 20 characters long that is made up of

584
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,120
capitals and letters our capitals and

585
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,440
numbers i mean um it's 20 characters

586
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,000
long spit out no hardcore keys and exit

587
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,880
2.

588
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,480
and i have a

589
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,840
readme over here that's got some

590
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,159
passwords keys in it and down below i

591
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,919
spit out the passwords

592
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,200
because that's the first thing and

593
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,960
evaluated it's like all right let's look

594
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,039
for those yep i see them pick out no

595
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,120
hard code password and we're good to go

596
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,840
are not good to go we stopped everything

597
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,679
awesome but it didn't tell me about the

598
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,600
other keys that i inserted that fall

599
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,520
into

600
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,360
the second case

601
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,960
so now i have to go back and rewrite

602
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,720
like how do i think through that how do

603
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,400
i actually evaluate for all of those

604
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
things at once is it just one giant if

605
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,799
statement

606
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,760
and a bunch of other things i insert

607
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,679
needed to consider and you can probably

608
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,360
imagine a bunch of stuff that's not on

609
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,880
this list

610
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,799
these are just literally the first 10

611
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,559
things i thought of like well if i'm

612
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,159
going to build this by hand what am i

613
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,840
going to build all right well i need to

614
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,000
okay how do i update for that okay ain't

615
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,679
nobody got time for that like let's be

616
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,679
honest your job isn't to go write a

617
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,520
bunch of bash scripts maybe it is

618
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,440
hopefully if that's a job out there let

619
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,360
me know because i love writing bash

620
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,679
scripts against git

621
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,520
but in all reality your job is probably

622
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,120
to do something else and this is like a

623
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,559
secondary thought to keep yourself safe

624
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,559
well open source to the rescue someone

625
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,080
else has sat down and thought through

626
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,159
all of these scenarios has thought

627
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,679
through this as

628
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,559
a thing and those people were aws

629
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,559
the the people over at aws labs and they

630
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,039
said here you go here is this entire

631
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,840
idea of just tell the computer with git

632
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,559
hooks to stop you from committing things

633
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,880
packaged up as an awesome program called

634
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,520
get secrets it's free it's open source

635
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
uh you can go dig around in it i learned

636
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,840
a lot digging around in the source code

637
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,080
and like it's just scripting but i

638
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,320
learned a lot about some bash tricks and

639
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,600
some get tricks that i really wasn't

640
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,520
aware of like um

641
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,360
or you already saw one of them but get

642
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,360
grupp i'd never use gitgrip before i

643
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,640
started writing this talk believe it or

644
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,799
not i knew it existed but started

645
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,679
actually playing with it it's pretty

646
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,200
powerful pretty awesome

647
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,720
anyway um

648
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,559
what git secrets does

649
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,280
uh you install the on your machine you

650
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,760
install it for every folder you want to

651
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,159
actually track with get secrets

652
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,880
uh if you run get secrets register aws

653
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,559
it does all of that stuff it says all

654
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,000
right i'm gonna start looking for things

655
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,200
that start

656
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,440
with those characters and are so long

657
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,919
that look like keys and

658
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,000
secret key assignments we shouldn't let

659
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,480
those in account id assignments

660
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,960
let's not let those in uh

661
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,400
but we're going to allow for these two

662
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,840
specific patterns which are out of the

663
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,919
book those are the example keys

664
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,080
um and you should be able to put example

665
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,520
keys in places in your comments and

666
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,360
whatnot that's cool we'll let that

667
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,039
happen uh and then we're gonna look in

668
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,200
your aws credentials folder

669
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,440
and specifically say anything in there

670
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,600
isn't allowed in any of your commits and

671
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,440
your aws

672
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,120
credentials folder should never be

673
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,440
committed to that repository

674
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
just in general so we should be good to

675
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,520
go there and

676
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
it gives us an ability to run git

677
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,159
secrets ad to put specific patterns like

678
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,840
we know there are certain passwords or

679
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,520
whatnot

680
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,600
that are going to be used and might be

681
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,039
hard coded someplace we can just add

682
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,039
those in very easily

683
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,640
uh and then every time you run a git

684
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,799
commit it's gonna fire up

685
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,960
so i have a

686
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,480
i get

687
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,320
clear it

688
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,559
just clear it real quick all right so i

689
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,000
have a file that

690
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,520
hit ahead and if i do a git commit

691
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,760
read me it's going to spit out

692
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,400
like hey you got these keys

693
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,520
that

694
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,120
are not

695
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,880
the example keys

696
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,480
hard-coded in there you also have

697
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,200
password stuff hard-coded in there

698
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,240
um

699
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,159
and it just stops but it gives me all of

700
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,520
those instances so that problem set of

701
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,679
like well how do i know if that's the

702
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,600
only problem i have

703
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,240
with my script uh that i looked at

704
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,840
earlier well they already solved that

705
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,919
that it automatically does that for you

706
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,679
so pretty cool

707
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,880
um

708
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,480
actually i ran the forgot to run this

709
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,200
one over here but um

710
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,320
when you actually install it what does

711
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
it do what is the actual

712
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,039
modification to your files well it goes

713
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,279
and installs this line

714
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,159
into a commit message pre-commit and

715
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,320
prepare commit message hooks so it puts

716
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,840
you three layers

717
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,039
of check

718
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,880
so if something happens between your

719
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,679
pre-commit and the commit message being

720
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,000
made where something gets inserted it's

721
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,600
gonna catch it then and just give you

722
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,799
that extra layer of security uh the

723
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,520
actual thing it runs is this

724
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,120
you'd have to dig into how git secrets

725
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,559
actually works to understand what this

726
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,400
does and we're not gonna get into that

727
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,200
today um but just evaluate the current

728
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,279
thing that you're trying to do and then

729
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,120
go look at the gut secrets and here's

730
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,640
all the patterns it defines these are

731
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,720
just kept in your config file under dot

732
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,600
get

733
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,960
um

734
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,640
and you can see it's some pretty awesome

735
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,840
regex

736
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,919
uh

737
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,520
i wouldn't want to write this by hand i

738
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,840
hate writing regex personally so i'm

739
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
very glad someone else has done it

740
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,200
and i know there's some of you sitting

741
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,880
out there um oh yeah i already showed

742
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,200
this um

743
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,880
but yeah it catches all the keys and

744
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,279
whatnot um i didn't have my passwords in

745
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,840
there when i was running this particular

746
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,760
example to make the screenshot

747
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,840
um and note those are obviously fake

748
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,159
keys i'm using don't ever ever share

749
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,320
real keys ever

750
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,880
if you can all help it especially in you

751
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,279
know public presentations like this um

752
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,720
feel free to use those keys all you want

753
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,559
they don't go to anything

754
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,679
and you're probably thinking well that's

755
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,720
all great for aws but i use

756
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,600
something else um i use uh google cloud

757
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,279
i use uh

758
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,400
azure

759
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,480
well again open source is there for you

760
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,919
they already figured this out it's

761
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,960
nothing you're going to have to do the

762
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,880
heavy lifting on

763
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,520
in fact even in the original version aws

764
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,400
put out they put this line get secrets

765
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,320
add provider

766
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,960
uh so you can define your own

767
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,720
anything

768
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,400
but azure and

769
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,640
a google cloud product

770
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,720
uh cloud platform i should say um

771
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
somebody else already solved that go

772
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,360
check out those repos we'll make these

773
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,640
slides available somewhere i'll throw

774
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,360
them out in the chat after my talk

775
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,240
um

776
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,559
you can go get to those and find those

777
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,840
and

778
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,520
one of the other cool things and i got i

779
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,679
think just enough time to demo it is

780
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,880
scan uh with all those awesome

781
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,960
flags and scan history so the first time

782
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,919
you put get secrets in you can do

783
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,360
a scan

784
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,120
say all right well here's currently

785
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,039
what's wrong so even before i try to

786
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,279
make a commit it will just detect here's

787
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,799
what's wrong

788
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,520
but if you put it in

789
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,320
uh

790
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,440
and there's nothing wrong with it but

791
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,880
he's like you know i thought i remember

792
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
committing something and taking it out

793
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,520
once you can just run commit

794
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,918
scan history

795
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,720
slightly bigger

796
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,240
i can't say i can't on the current

797
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,600
screen um but uh get secrets scan

798
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,080
history here's every commit

799
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,640
i put a secret so now i can go back and

800
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,120
do that surgery at this point i probably

801
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,880
pushed it and it might be too late i

802
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,559
know for this particular repo this

803
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,000
little fun thing i'm building on the

804
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,080
side that way too early to talk about i

805
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,440
know i've never pushed it to github so

806
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,919
it's just locals like okay

807
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,640
if this was an actual real keys i could

808
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,760
go in

809
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,559
and surgery my repo before i ever push

810
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,360
it to the public and i would be safe

811
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,320
uh

812
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,760
you might be horrified the first time

813
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,000
you run it i was the first time i ran in

814
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,440
on a real repo that i have out in the

815
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,559
world uh fortunately that instance is

816
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,440
gone

817
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,120
uh that head was the keys to so i was

818
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,200
like all right bullet dodge but it still

819
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,320
scared the heck out of me the first time

820
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,600
i ever did that against one of my real

821
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,159
repos uh but good secrets go out and try

822
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,399
it in conclusion for this part uh don't

823
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,880
hard code your secrets

824
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,720
don't commit your secrets

825
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,320
if you do commit your secrets definitely

826
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,520
don't push them

827
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,760
use automation wherever possible we're

828
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,840
only human

829
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,080
be kind to yourself everybody makes a

830
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,559
mistake everybody accidentally

831
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,360
commits a secret somewhere sometimes

832
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,960
it's okay to commit

833
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,799
just if you can catch it before you push

834
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,880
it your life's gonna be a lot better

835
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,279
and open source is there for you

836
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,840
and if you find it useful commit back if

837
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,919
there's a use case that hey i wish it

838
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,240
did this aws is pretty responsive in

839
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,120
their issue queue for secrets and uh

840
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,960
will help you figure this off out pretty

841
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,360
quick um i know i ran into a couple like

842
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,200
question marks and found the answers in

843
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,679
issue queue like immediately

844
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,360
um

845
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,200
all right let's talk about something a

846
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,399
little more lighthearted and a little

847
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,760
less threatening to all of our

848
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,960
livelihoods

849
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,720
uh improv and when you first hear improv

850
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,840
uh

851
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,240
you might start thinking like oh improv

852
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,679
shows and i'm not gonna invite you to an

853
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,440
improv show if you were here in chicago

854
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,559
you're more than welcome to come hang

855
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,679
out with me the bug house for the

856
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,640
annoyance uh message me afterward i'll

857
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,720
tell you when i'm on stage over there uh

858
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,120
but i've been an improviser since 2010

859
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,559
uh started out in san francisco

860
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,520
i used to run barprov sfr prob elemental

861
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,320
improv uh i was one of the early people

862
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,480
in piano fighting end games went to

863
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,760
school at bats

864
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,440
uh so i've been doing improv for you

865
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,559
know 12

866
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,000
12 years now

867
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,520
later this month will be 12 years

868
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,559
exactly

869
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,600
um

870
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,360
and something that's helped me out a

871
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,840
great deal in my

872
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,399
life and why am i talking about improv

873
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,159
because improv provides this awesome set

874
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,399
of life skills

875
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,960
that i've never learned anywhere else i

876
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,039
mean life does teach you them but it's a

877
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,559
lot more fun to learn them in a

878
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,360
controlled setting uh and against

879
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,320
you know

880
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,799
the stage versus the rest of life

881
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,720
there's there's one picture i think sums

882
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,880
up why we need improv better than

883
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,960
anything else i've ever seen

884
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,880
and it's mike tyson

885
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,240
everybody's got a plan until they get

886
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,480
punched in the mouth you can prep all

887
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,080
day you can

888
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,000
make all sorts of plans in your head you

889
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,440
can rehearse in front of a mirror a

890
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,039
million times

891
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,000
but until you're actually in front of a

892
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,320
stakeholder and they ask you a question

893
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,880
that you're really not prepared for

894
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,080
um

895
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,200
you don't really have to think on your

896
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
feet until you're in that situation

897
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,960
until you get punched in the face

898
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,559
having some kind of training or thought

899
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,080
process to get you in the right mindset

900
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,159
when you do get punched in the face is

901
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,279
extremely helpful in life

902
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,600
the other reason i like of improv is

903
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,440
it's literally magic

904
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,799
i'm not going to read this quote to you

905
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,960
but it comes from viola spallan the

906
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,679
grandmother of all american improv

907
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,159
uh she wrote this book she also started

908
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,279
um

909
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,200
a bunch of programs her son was paul

910
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,559
sills who started a little company

911
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,399
called second city you heard a second

912
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,640
city improv that's a direct result of

913
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,039
violence forum's work

914
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,480
but it's literally what she's saying

915
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,679
here it's the

916
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,760
it's making the invisible visible it's

917
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,440
peeling back that curtain of reality

918
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,279
it's it's going

919
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,320
not from

920
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,120
what's

921
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,440
possibly possible from where someone

922
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,919
else wrote it down and defined the box

923
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,840
it's literally being able to define the

924
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,480
box yourself and think outside of it

925
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,720
think beyond it think in a world without

926
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,159
boxes

927
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,240
and then pull that into our reality in

928
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,200
the

929
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,080
in the context of on stage

930
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,159
there's tons of safety to do that you

931
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,240
could be an astronaut in space like it's

932
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,080
losing air and the audience might be a

933
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,120
little tense with you but you're not

934
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,600
gonna die you can shoot someone on stage

935
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,519
like finger like point your hand at them

936
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,200
like you're holding a gun and shoot them

937
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,880
and they'll die on stage but none of the

938
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,240
audience think that person is dead

939
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,080
there's tons of safety on the stage to

940
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,200
do that

941
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,000
uh but

942
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,600
beyond the stage all of these lessons

943
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,960
actually

944
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,039
make your life a lot better if you start

945
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,480
playing by them

946
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,519
so we're just going to jump into the

947
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,880
seven improv principles and we're

948
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,240
looking at four

949
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,200
uh exercises really quick i know i got

950
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,039
less than 15 minutes left so these are

951
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,200
going to go pretty quick um

952
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,720
but a lot of them you probably already

953
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,080
heard before and don't need a lot of

954
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,279
explanation

955
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,600
the first one everybody has heard this

956
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,320
at some point yes and this is the core

957
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,720
building block

958
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,679
on stage since we don't have a script

959
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,120
we're building on what the other person

960
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,080
says

961
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,120
yes uh like i like tomatoes yes and i

962
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,559
have the biggest batch of tomatoes

963
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,640
you've ever seen yes and i had some of

964
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,880
those tomatoes and overall i don't think

965
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,559
they're the best tomatoes yes and

966
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,840
they're the best tomatoes in the county

967
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,200
at least

968
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,880
and you can suddenly have a scene out of

969
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,240
nothing i just made that up out of my

970
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,039
head

971
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,799
because all i did was say yes and and

972
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,080
fill in the blank

973
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,399
this is so useful in life especially

974
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,960
when you get really poorly defined

975
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,519
specifications for a job if someone

976
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,559
gives you

977
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,399
a request a ticket

978
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,919
and you don't understand what it says

979
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,000
your immediate gut reaction will be no

980
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,519
this is dumb

981
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,039
i don't want to do this

982
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,760
if you instead approach it as yes i can

983
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,640
do that and i need you to define

984
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
this part a little bit better

985
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,720
yes and that's going to add another 20

986
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,600
hours to the project

987
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
adding more information but saying yes

988
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,840
we can do this and it's going to have

989
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,679
these consequences

990
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,039
they might not have thought that through

991
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,559
they might think all i want is the

992
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,799
background color to be green now

993
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,320
yes and we're going to have to adjust

994
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,840
the rest of the color palette once i

995
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,679
adjust that to green to make everything

996
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,519
else visible and fall within ally

997
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,799
compliance

998
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,159
they might not that they might not have

999
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,679
thought of that so if you approach it

1000
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,120
with

1001
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,440
a no no we don't want to do that because

1002
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,600
it's going to cause these things

1003
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,360
immediately you're in confrontation if

1004
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,799
you're agreeing with them and you're

1005
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,240
helping them sound out the idea

1006
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,159
they're gonna be okay well they're not

1007
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,279
against me and they're just trying to

1008
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,960
help me and you're gonna get a better

1009
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,200
reaction this goes beyond projects this

1010
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,279
goes to making a shopping list with your

1011
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,240
partner this goes to literally anyone

1012
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,720
asking you to do anything yes we can and

1013
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,640
here's the consequences

1014
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,559
so always always

1015
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,600
need jerk reaction want to say yes but

1016
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,519
also build on top of it not just meekly

1017
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,760
say yeah and go off and do it

1018
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,359
have the conversation if it's something

1019
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,280
positive too tell them how excited you

1020
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,280
are yes and i think that's a great idea

1021
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,800
and here's why

1022
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,520
yes and is super powerful

1023
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,480
start with the obvious

1024
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,560
whenever you get stuck

1025
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,480
write down what you know this is also

1026
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,560
the core of rubber duck programming but

1027
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,760
this goes well beyond just the world of

1028
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,000
programming and computers

1029
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,918
always start with what you know or what

1030
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,679
you think you know because what's

1031
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,359
obvious to you might not be obvious to

1032
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,839
everyone and sometimes you're revealing

1033
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,079
what you think is obvious everyone else

1034
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,440
will suddenly be like wait a minute i

1035
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,800
didn't think about that that literally

1036
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
happened to me last week where we were

1037
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,199
writing copy for something and uh one of

1038
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,119
the new people at my office like we

1039
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,800
asked him like how would you do this and

1040
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,239
he just like rattled off kind of

1041
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,918
nonchalantly like well we got to do this

1042
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,359
and this and this and one of the things

1043
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,599
he said that was obvious to him everyone

1044
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,720
else in the room looked at each other

1045
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,240
and like why didn't we think of that we

1046
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,720
missed that to him it was just obvious

1047
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,480
what he didn't think he he thought he

1048
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,760
would be looked down on for saying

1049
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,520
something so obvious and he was the hero

1050
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,359
of the day so always start with where

1051
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,880
you think is obvious

1052
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,880
and sometimes that is just the genius

1053
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,839
everyone else needed

1054
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,480
actively listen um i really love this uh

1055
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,680
quote by chuck

1056
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,920
palahniuk um

1057
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
don't just listen for where you can put

1058
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,640
in

1059
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,640
your thoughts we often do this when

1060
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,960
we're requirement building with clients

1061
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,640
with stakeholders

1062
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,240
as soon as we hear something like i can

1063
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,040
use next.js for that our entire brain

1064
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,880
switches off from listening and starts

1065
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,720
building the application

1066
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
i know this is true for me

1067
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,160
as soon as i figure out how i can

1068
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,920
automate a thing i will start automating

1069
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,160
it in my head no matter what it is i

1070
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,280
don't even finish listening to the

1071
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,560
requirements i'll go back and read the

1072
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,119
requirements later uh so i suffer from

1073
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,880
not actively listening enough myself so

1074
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,240
everybody does it

1075
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,960
but

1076
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,280
if you put your full attention to what

1077
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,200
they're saying and actively listen not

1078
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,320
just to the words coming out of their

1079
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,119
mouth

1080
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,160
but their context and what

1081
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,640
is behind those words you're gonna get a

1082
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,359
lot farther a lot faster with

1083
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,920
with pretty much everything in life

1084
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,800
so

1085
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,880
be careful not to start

1086
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,599
replying before they stop talking

1087
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,680
give it a breath it's never a bad idea

1088
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,079
to listen to somebody's question or

1089
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,440
requirements take a deep breath

1090
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,839
and then talk uh no one's ever getting

1091
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,680
mad for you breathing for two seconds

1092
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,359
hopefully you don't

1093
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,359
um one of my heroes and one of my

1094
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,440
teachers back in my days at bats about a

1095
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,920
decade ago john remak here you might not

1096
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,359
have heard of him but

1097
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,200
san francisco is awesome he's one of the

1098
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,880
awesome teachers out there

1099
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,079
but he always said start your scenes

1100
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,680
happy healthy and well

1101
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,200
um

1102
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,520
this really is assume

1103
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,560
um

1104
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,480
assume good motivation when someone's

1105
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,320
written you a requirement or ask you to

1106
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,400
do something if you think like that

1107
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,839
person's against me and they're only

1108
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,599
asking me to do this because they hate

1109
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,599
me and they want my life to be bad

1110
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,960
you're gonna have a bad time with them

1111
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,280
no matter what um if you think this is

1112
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,880
coming from a genuine place where they

1113
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,040
want the world to be a better

1114
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,640
and there's a reason they're asking you

1115
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,400
to do this and there's a happy healthy

1116
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,640
and well reason

1117
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,000
you're gonna have an overall better set

1118
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,680
of conversations it's like okay i

1119
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,359
understand you need this done

1120
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,359
help me understand why you think this

1121
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:24,960
makes the world better

1122
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,880
and sometimes they don't have a reason

1123
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,640
um but most of the time they will

1124
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,720
there's a actual

1125
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,400
thought process behind them asking the

1126
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,079
request even no matter how badly

1127
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,400
documented no matter what they how badly

1128
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,599
framed just assume good intent

1129
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,280
um

1130
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,760
here's a misquote from charles darwin

1131
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,079
but adaptability is one of the things

1132
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,520
that makes us awesome as human beings

1133
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,560
but we can get to a point where

1134
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,680
we start

1135
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,240
stonewalling we start saying hey the

1136
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,880
best practice says x therefore i'm gonna

1137
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,880
do it this way no matter what the

1138
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,000
outcome

1139
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,800
uh

1140
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,960
we can get to a place of

1141
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,320
best practice

1142
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,280
uh

1143
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,119
says i should never

1144
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,079
uh

1145
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,359
i should only use two-factor

1146
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,640
authentication

1147
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,720
for every single thing

1148
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,880
and that is a best practice uh and we

1149
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
are slowly getting the world to accept

1150
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,119
that but if you have a client who can

1151
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,599
barely turn on their cell phone

1152
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,760
um that has no concept of anything

1153
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,920
beyond a password and they have to reset

1154
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,040
their password 20 times a day

1155
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,680
maybe that person needs some help um

1156
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,800
and maybe they don't need two-factor

1157
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,560
authentication for logging into their

1158
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,960
wordpress site that no one looks at

1159
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,240
i don't know uh not saying don't follow

1160
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,480
good practices yes where it makes sense

1161
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,079
follow them but don't follow them to the

1162
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,079
point where you are

1163
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,200
a zealot

1164
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,640
where it's

1165
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,320
it's not processes over people let's

1166
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,760
never forget that it's people over

1167
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,680
processes that's what agile really gave

1168
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,119
us

1169
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,040
um ultimately we want to make all the

1170
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,960
other players in the room look awesome

1171
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,960
so make other players look good

1172
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,760
uh if you end your day with you your

1173
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,200
work done but

1174
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,040
everyone else kind of like okay it's

1175
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,880
technically good but now we look bad

1176
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,320
because he made us look bad or they made

1177
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,520
us look bad

1178
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,359
uh no one's gonna have a good time they

1179
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,640
don't know i'm not gonna want to work

1180
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,680
with you on that so make sure you're

1181
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,440
making other players look good i realize

1182
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,480
i'm running out of time so i'm gonna go

1183
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,760
a lot faster now

1184
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,720
uh

1185
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,240
except failure as part of the process

1186
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,000
it just is nobody gets everything right

1187
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,720
on the first try if we did

1188
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,400
what a crazy awesome world that would be

1189
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,240
but that's not how it works most people

1190
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,839
are going to fail a bunch more than they

1191
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,720
succeed just accepting that accepting

1192
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,200
the failure and celebrating the failure

1193
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,839
every time you fail

1194
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,760
that was a learning opportunity and if

1195
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,000
you can show that hey i failed at all

1196
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,920
this stuff but look how much i learned

1197
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,680
everyone's gonna respect that everyone's

1198
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,920
gonna love that um if you constantly

1199
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,839
fail and you're not learning anything

1200
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,680
there's a problem there but if you

1201
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,760
accept like hey i failed but hey i'm not

1202
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,040
gonna do it next time look at all the

1203
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,200
stuff i've learned as a result

1204
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
just writing up that as an interviewer

1205
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,119
review or a quarterly review with your

1206
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,880
managers

1207
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,400
they're gonna have a better conversation

1208
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,079
and a much honest more honest

1209
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,359
conversation where instead of them

1210
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,280
pointing out your flaws you're saying

1211
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
hey i didn't get everything right but

1212
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,960
here's where i learned and here's how i

1213
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,119
improve my process out of it

1214
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,560
they're going to love that conversation

1215
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,440
i guarantee it so let's look at oh yeah

1216
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,280
go ahead we've got uh

1217
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,880
we've got actually just a couple minutes

1218
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,960
left and we did have one question that i

1219
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,680
wanted to ask you um let's see here fit

1220
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,400
from the uh chat they wanted to ask who

1221
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,839
was your favorite instructor at the

1222
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,640
annoyance and also did you ever hang out

1223
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,960

1227
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,400

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,920
off top my head but he was my favorite

1229

in front of a live studio audience um

1235
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,440
