1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,080
hi everyone

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,960
so i'm going to be talking about uh

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,279
security documentation and give an

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,639
overview into leather working

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,280
so uh

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,599
brief agenda of what we're talking about

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,039
who am i

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,640
knowing the target audience of this talk

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,480
you know my documentation um you know

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,800
what made me think that yeah i think

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,920
everybody would love to hear about

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,400
documentation i know i think party when

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,079
i hear documentation

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,320
um you know how to tell the story when

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,480
you're doing some type of um you know

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,079
reporting

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,760
uh knowing the requirements like knowing

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,920
who you're who your audience is uh if um

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,239
when you're using pictures how to frame

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,879
them so that it's telling um

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,199
a tale that's not too

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,160
uh too verbose and just making a

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,120
checkpoint to review your work

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,160
so the um obligatory who am i slide you

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,399
know i've been with the western regional

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,799
ccdc for 10 years

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,000
um i will go into that in a little bit

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,280
uh it's a

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,159
it's a cyber security competition where

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,159
uh college students get

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,400
uh attacked by professional red teamers

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,799
i was on the blue team and then um i've

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,479
been the lead

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,799
um of the scoring team

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,240
since 2016 um in my security profession

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,400
i've been doing endpoint engineering

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
vulnerability management and i'm

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
currently a senior cyber intelligence

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,040
analyst

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,840
um

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,400
and you know been a hacker

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,439
way longer than that but i've been um

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,880
doing

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,119
being a goon for defcon for the last

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,680
five years

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,880
so

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,280
overall the target audience of this is

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,439
for uh stock analysts

49
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,280
and for like threat intelligence that's

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,399
what i do in my day-to-day role and just

51
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,119
trying to um you know make sure that

52
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,600
that's uh the intended audience

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,159
and just know that

54
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,318
this can apply for anyone but the main

55
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,000
focus for myself is the uh is to

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,080
um

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,800
the

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,319
stock analysts and threat intelligence

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,200
so

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,520
why documentation right documentation is

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,920
pretty important nobody really want

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,520
enjoys doing it

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640
and you know in my own

64
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,080
experience with

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,200
and i apologize to the um

66
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
so the folks who are doing the

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,640
captioning for this

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,200
i mentioned earlier it's the ccdc it's

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,080
the collegiate cyber defense competition

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,920
i'm out of the western region

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,440
and

72
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,800
one of those goals is that the

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,959
students get tasks

74
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,400
from the

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,319
scoring team and their their job is to

76
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,760
accomplish these tasks they can be

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,480
business tasks such as

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
um

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,360
you know

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,560
replying to the ceo's email to

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,239
also

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,800
doing technical tasks and oftentimes you

83
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,239
know the very first thing that we give

84
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:10,959
them

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,400
is

86
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
cis control number one which is an asset

87
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,000
inventory

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,239
and you know there's plenty of times

89
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,400
where we get good documentation back

90
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,319
where they account for all the assets

91
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,280
and things but then there's other times

92
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,239
where we'll receive um

93
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,640
we'll receive back documentation where

94
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
we ask for an asset inventory and then

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
they just give us walls and walls of

96
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
text of an nmap

97
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,000
report there's no filtering so it's the

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
raw output

99
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,879
it

100
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,360
spans 50 pages etc

101
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,760
so you know there's too much

102
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,000
documentation and it's not necessarily

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,080
relevant you know in a real world

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,680
example

105
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,519
i was on

106
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,920
a vulnerability management team

107
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,680
and a major uh you know security vendors

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,159
report came back with a hundred thousand

109
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,920
plus pages i think honestly it was

110
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,280
somewhere in the neighborhood two or

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
three hundred thousand pages in a pdf

112
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,319
file

113
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,640
i turned to my cso and i said

114
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,480
hey is it cool like if i give you a

115
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,560
hundred thousand page uh phone report

116
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,639
and he's like dude i would get fired if

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,320
you sent me that thing

118
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,000
so it's just so much overkill um where

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,120
there's bad documentation coming from

120
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,440
from even from the vendors that we have

121
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,919
to clean up before we can send it off to

122
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,000
um you know to the relevant parties

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
another reason why documentation's so

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
important is that there's real world

125
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,479
consequences

126
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,960
so you know if you're documenting an

127
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,520
incident and you see that some malware

128
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,720
executed

129
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,520
or even you know you see a user doing

130
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,120
some malicious things

131
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
and you know you have to write it up

132
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,000
those findings can go

133
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,720
to

134
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,960
hr they can go to legal they can go to

135
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,800
the authorities depending on how bad the

136
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,320
incident is

137
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,600
so

138
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,440
you know there's definitely

139
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,000
um some real world connotations where

140
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,919
what we provide

141
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,120
will

142
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,240
be used in a context that's not

143
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,320
that's not our intended audience so it

144
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,919
needs to be clear and it needs to be

145
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,400
concise

146
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,120
when you're telling the story

147
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,199
you know you have to realize that

148
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,600
security is basically just knowing

149
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,240
what's normal and being able to explain

150
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,400
why it's deviant

151
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,919
um

152
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,160
the

153
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,720
the way a program will load is you know

154
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,039
you click the icon it loads into memory

155
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,880
it opens a file and then it writes you

156
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,960
know you save the file to disk

157
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,400
but

158
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,600
if you open the program and then now it

159
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
starts calling out to the internet and

160
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,880
it's not designed to call out to the

161
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,560
internet like you have to be able to

162
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,360
explain that clearly and concisely

163
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,160
that

164
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
you know what we're seeing here is not

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,280
normal and here is why

166
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,639
the main part of telling the story is

167
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,560
that you're you know you're doing

168
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,639
basically investigative

169
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,280
um work and you know if you've heard if

170
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,600
you've taken like journalism 101 you

171
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,880
know you'll hear of the 5w who the what

172
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,680
the when the where and the why

173
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,720
and by answering those five questions

174
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
oftentimes you you basically tell the

175
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,199
story of how as well

176
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,360
um sometimes you'll hear the five w's

177
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,479
and the h

178
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,280
but

179
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,800
when you're telling that story you know

180
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,720
you have to

181
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,919
explain

182
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,360
you know this user was observed

183
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,720
accessing this file share and this file

184
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,520
share

185
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,639
uh

186
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,599
you know was operating in a non-standard

187
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,720
way

188
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,080
so as you

189
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,160
you go through you have to answer those

190
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,759
questions

191
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,280
will you have all the answers to those

192
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
questions not necessarily

193
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,759
but it definitely helps

194
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,759
to gather as much information as you can

195
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,599
you know and when you're doing this

196
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,800
reporting

197
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,759
you um you know you should be using like

198
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,160
a neutral language language right you're

199
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,240
going off of what you've observed and

200
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,680
not so much

201
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,720
what

202
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,919
um

203
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,919
you know you're not accusing you know

204
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,440
you're going off of the facts and the

205
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,560
facts say

206
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,199
that you saw this user account access

207
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,680
this directory at this time you're not

208
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,919
saying oh this user is totally trying to

209
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,560
compromise the entire you know the

210
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,520
entire company and and i can prove it no

211
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,360
it's like

212
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,039
you know you're you're

213
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,039
you know this is a computer that is

214
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,319
associated with this user id and and

215
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,440
trying to keep the language neutral

216
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,280
also helps um

217
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
to tell the story accurately you know

218
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,520
you want to avoid um accusing

219
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,440
accusations you want to avoid um

220
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,919
embellishment you don't want to say

221
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,280
oh i found

222
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,199
10 000 files in this directory and

223
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,000
there's literally just 100 you know

224
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,280
and

225
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,319
you don't want to speculate either well

226
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,280
you know

227
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,520
it's it's obvious that he was doing this

228
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,080
like no there's real no obvious answer

229
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,840
you want to go off of and stick with

230
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,000
basically the facts that you

231
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,599
are

232
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,759
are observing

233
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,599
so when you're writing

234
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,159
it's it's this technical writing where

235
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,399
you're going to need to put in details

236
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,839
ip addresses um you know file hashes

237
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,440
uh you know crazy commands that you're

238
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,159
seeing observing and so with that you

239
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,279
have to know

240
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,519
that your audience

241
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,279
may not be

242
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,200
in that same boat with you they may not

243
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
have that same level of

244
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,240
of understanding so you have to

245
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,480
um you know take a few extra steps to

246
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,279
explain and say

247
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,920
you know this is bad because

248
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,959
um

249
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,440
when this was observed these things

250
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,839
happen and here's another

251
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,720
you know just like this is

252
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,399
because of

253
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,519
x y or z happening you want to

254
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,040
make it a point to

255
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,800
include the technical details but you

256
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,399
might also have to rephrase it and

257
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,480
restate it so that it's clear

258
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,320
you know the one

259
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,480
one key thing is you know know what your

260
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,040
audience or know your audience rather so

261
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,720
are you addressing you know fellow

262
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,399
analysts or engineers or are you

263
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,440
addressing your c-suite

264
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,720
you know where i'm uh where i'm

265
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,000
currently at

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,200
the

267
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,399
um the cso has worked through the entire

268
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,040
rank so they want the technical detail

269
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,480
when we tell them

270
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,399
you know a file hash

271
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,800
was observed and seeing malware

272
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,120
executing on this specific port on this

273
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,040
specific protocol

274
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,920
but

275
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,000
um you know other folks may not they may

276
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,760
not understand at all what you're

277
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,920
talking about so you really have to try

278
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,399
to understand who's asking the question

279
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,560
what type of

280
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,519
you know what type of

281
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,760
uh information are you trying to

282
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,800
convey

283
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,439
to the right audience

284
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,600
so one one thing about screenshots is

285
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,839
that they're great they tell

286
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,399
so much you know the whole adage of if a

287
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,040
picture is worth a thousand words right

288
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,519
but when you're when you're including a

289
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,440
screenshot you know are you able to

290
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
tell the picture you know tell what

291
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,040
understand what the picture is trying to

292
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,079
say

293
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,200
so

294
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,880
i grabbed this example because i knew it

295
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,839
was cluttered right um but if you take a

296
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,240
moment can you find steam and you find

297
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,640
the logo for handbrake in there

298
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,519
right

299
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,600
so let me go ahead and try to clarify

300
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,360
that and show you

301
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,480
right

302
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,279
so

303
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,040
with this i've

304
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,200
they're still there they're i've

305
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,120
obfuscated the rest of the background so

306
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,040
that you know i've i've blurred out

307
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,640
everything that's not steam and

308
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,000
handbrake but

309
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,360
it's still

310
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
a bit of a challenge

311
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
so now here

312
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,360
you know it was uh right there so when

313
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,200
you're working with

314
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,279
with screenshots and you're trying to

315
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,399
include that as part of your

316
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,839
documentation you want to make sure to

317
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,800
um to like crop down and emphasize

318
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,720
specific things right you know the

319
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
relevant detail

320
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,839
um

321
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,240
you know you you see a command uh

322
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,480
running and you see these files on the

323
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,440
disk

324
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,519
then you know if there's a screenshot

325
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,040
where it's just this massive wall of

326
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,680
text you know do you really need every

327
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,760
single thing on that

328
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,000
on that screenshot can you crop out

329
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
sections and only highlight what's

330
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,320
what's really telling the story what's

331
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,440
really relevant to the story

332
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,320
so this is a an example of um

333
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,519
the ipfs uh protocol and so that i just

334
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,200
took the screenshot and tried to

335
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,639
emphasize like

336
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,639
you know i highlighted that the

337
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,839
documents

338
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,920
docs.ipfs.io site um does show that

339
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,760
there's a browser companion available

340
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,680
and just you know with this screenshot

341
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,880
it's it's

342
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,440
being able to convey like you know

343
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,519
you can just click here and click here

344
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,760
and now you can find whatever it is you

345
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,000
need on this or you know with this

346
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,680
specific page

347
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,839
so just being able to

348
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,839
prop things down a little bit

349
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,480
and and just highlight and emphasize you

350
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,320
know you can definitely go too crazy

351
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,519
with the

352
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,839
um with adding annotations to

353
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,760
screenshots as well so

354
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
just be mindful of only highlight the

355
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,880
relevant details

356
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,440
so

357
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
um the other thing with this is to make

358
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,680
sure that you are reviewing your work

359
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,240
right you know get a second opinion um

360
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,639
have a peer take a take a look at it and

361
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,440
say

362
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,360
um you know i wrote up this report can

363
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,120
you just take a few minutes and read

364
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,480
this over for me

365
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,200
um that says a lot because

366
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,480
there have been plenty of times where i

367
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,000
wrote something i thought it was

368
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,760
beautiful and i was getting ready to hit

369
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,959
send and

370
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,639
i was like hey let me ask my my

371
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,399
co-worker they looked it over and now it

372
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,279
was

373
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,279
um oh you know this sentence just

374
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,040
doesn't make any sense can you know what

375
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,120
do you mean by this and then i'd revise

376
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,279
the sentence and send it over and then i

377
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,279
finally look like that that's a cute

378
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,920
puppy there and say well okay says it

379
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,440
looks good all right i'm happy so

380
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,160
definitely get a second opinion um

381
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
before you send out any documentation

382
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,519
that you need to

383
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,040
the other thing is um you know

384
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
definitely use spell check and grammar

385
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
checking and you know there's a huge

386
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
asterisk there because

387
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,720
uh when you're writing with technical um

388
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,240
documentation

389
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,440
it's

390
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,320
um you know we have so many acronyms and

391
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,680
jargon that

392
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,360
you know you could write an entire

393
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
paragraph that makes sense to you but

394
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
since the spell checker will just freak

395
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,920
out on you and say every word is wrong

396
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
so from there

397
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,279
you know you can either

398
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,160
um

399
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,279
you know

400
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,199
suffer through it and click next on you

401
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,040
know dhcp next next next next text

402
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,199
or you can add those phrases to the

403
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,399
spell checkers so that they're

404
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,800
recognized for the next time

405
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,639
um

406
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,959
so with that

407
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,399
i'm

408
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,639
let's go ahead and switch it up and take

409
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,160
it over to

410
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,040
the

411
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,600
other camera and it's just one second

412
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
here

413
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,600
great

414
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,839
turn on my

415
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,360
other light here so we can see some

416
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,800
things

417
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,040
all right switching gears all together

418
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,079
so

419
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,839
um who am i i'm still

420
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,040
tim what are we going to talk about

421
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,880
we're going to talk about

422
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,680
leather working and how i got into it

423
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,199
just some of the qualities of leather

424
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,120
working or leather

425
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,199
uh how you can recognize good good

426
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,680
leather bad leather um some of the tools

427
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,279
techniques and procedures that are used

428
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,519
in liquid working and i'm not sorry for

429
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,199
that pun

430
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,360
so

431
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,959
for this uh

432
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,639
i

433
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,680
was introduced to weather working

434
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,399
through the crucible it's an industrial

435
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,759
art school based out of oakland

436
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,120
california

437
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,040
and i took two classes one was like an

438
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,560
introductory course

439
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
and that was in 2017

440
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,720
and then i took like their follow-on you

441
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,759
know level two and for that

442
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,360
you know this was something that i had

443
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,600
made during the leather uh leather

444
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,199
working one course

445
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,839
where it's a

446
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,959
small bag and you know this was like one

447
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,440
of the projects that came with it and

448
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,880
you know this is always going to eat at

449
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,680
me with these two extra holes here

450
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,519
but you know they're hidden on the front

451
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,519
so you know there's bags that i've made

452
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,720
there's

453
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,320
coasters that i've made where this is

454
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,959
the los angeles kings hockey logo

455
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,040
i've got another coaster here where i've

456
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,519
got a flower

457
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,079
and you know you see the contours

458
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,399
in here and that is

459
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,920
some of the tools which i'll show you

460
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,720
how to make some of those contours

461
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,199
this one's a prototype of a

462
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,720
new slash slipper that i've made um it's

463
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,279
like has lining on the top

464
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,519
where the lining

465
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,759
uh so you put your foot in it's not just

466
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,160
a solid raw piece of leather

467
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,639
so that's a sample that i made there

468
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,279
all right so now talking about

469
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,399
uh

470
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,199
sizes and shapes of leather

471
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,800
you know you have to picture this is a

472
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,079
cow and oftentimes young cow it also

473
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,079
comes in um

474
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,759
goats and

475
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,839
sheep etc but you know the most common

476
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:04,959
is cow

477
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,400
and it's uh when they take the skin off

478
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,640
the animal you have um the different

479
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,240
sizes so you would have a whole high

480
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,079
that you can purchase you have a side

481
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,119
where they just give you half of it

482
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,720
you know the portion from the top

483
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,799
forward is for the uh double shoulder

484
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,119
and that's again from the hoof all the

485
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,280
way around the animal to the other end

486
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,559
of the hoof

487
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,880
um then you also have single shoulders

488
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
bends double bends which is more of like

489
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,600
the stomach or the back area you have

490
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,960
the belly

491
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,679
and then you also have the single butt

492
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,919
i just wanted to say single butt

493
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,240
okay

494
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,440
next up so now this is where we talk

495
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,799
about the

496
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,960
qualities of leather and how you can

497
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,600
recognize um different types so

498
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,440
when we're talking about

499
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,080
chrome tan

500
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,080
chrome tan leather is already finished

501
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,400
and it's pretty soft

502
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,640
and what the tanning process is is the

503
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,080
leather is

504
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,679
um

505
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,480
the leather is rubbed with salt to dry

506
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,360
it out so that any um

507
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,039
any extra

508
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,039
liquid and moisture in it

509
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,600
uh is taken out so that the

510
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,000
uh so that the

511
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,960
um

512
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,640
the leather doesn't like rot from all

513
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,559
this excess moisture

514
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,480
so chrome tan is typically soft and

515
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,799
flexible you know this is a piece here

516
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,039
really thin

517
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,000
and also comes in an array of colors

518
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,600
they tend to do the tanning and the

519
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,679
color at the same time

520
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,280
so again fairly fairly flexible fairly

521
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,480
thin

522
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,000
then the

523
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,160
when you're talking leather working it's

524
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,480
typically um

525
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,080
what we're talking about here is

526
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,840
vegetable tan so they take

527
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,320
materials from

528
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
tree bark and things like that and those

529
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,720
are used to dry the leather

530
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,679
so that

531
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:06,880
it will

532
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,080
extract

533
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,039
all the moisture out now this piece is

534
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,760
um pretty nice it is

535
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,919
um when and also when you hear vegetable

536
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,480
tan it's typically comes with the

537
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,120
this natural color

538
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,559
and this has the ability to be dyed the

539
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,160
other colors when they're pre-dyed you

540
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,080
can't really dye them again so now

541
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,360
this one is also

542
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,200
this one is also

543
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,600
vegetable tan but this one is dyed a

544
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,320
dark brown

545
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,760
okay so when we're talking about the

546
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,880
types and grain of leather

547
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,480
so we have

548
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,400
uh the full grain and the top grain

549
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,880
which is basically the first couple of

550
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,160
layers here so the um full grain is here

551
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,520
and you know you're looking at the cross

552
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,360
section of the

553
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,600
the hide

554
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,840
and then once that's kind of stripped

555
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,720
away

556
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,240
then you're left with the suede and

557
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,480
that's like the real soft felty type of

558
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,440
leather

559
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,919
and then you know you've seen phrases

560
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,200
running around where

561
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,720
you go to buy something it's like oh

562
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,960
genuine leather

563
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,880
the only thing that's genuine about it

564
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,480
is that it is the

565
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,200
scraps of leather um it's basically the

566
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,120
hot dog of leather they just take all

567
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,840
the bad parts of leather

568
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,320
mush it together and slap the genuine

569
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
label on there and to try to sell it to

570
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,039
you like it's a um you know like it's

571
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,960
this premium piece but it's really not

572
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,640
what you would want is you would want

573
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
the full grain or the top grain those

574
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,480
are the the premier pieces of leather

575
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,760
so and how do we get that is they feed

576
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,720
the

577
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,400
cowhide through

578
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,960
um through a splitter it splits it now

579
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,559
you have the top cut which is the full

580
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,400
grain and the top grain and then the

581
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,240
bottom cut where the suede

582
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,640
um and genuine leather and other types

583
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,480
of leather are processed out of the the

584
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,520
bottom piece of it there

585
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,039
so now this measurement has always

586
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,200
confused me so

587
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,159
um

588
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,320
bear with me

589
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,400
now they always talk about the thickness

590
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,240
being in ounces or millimeters now

591
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,360
there's a handy gauge that is sold

592
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
and you have

593
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,280
this here where

594
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,760
see if i get that there so it has

595
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,320
measurements where it basically says um

596
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,400
you know two millimeters or

597
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,799
uh eight ounces and

598
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,039
three point two millimeters etc

599
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,600
so what this is

600
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,960
is

601
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,039
once the leather is split to 1 64 of an

602
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,400
inch i believe

603
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,799
then they weigh it and

604
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,760
1 64 of an inch for an entire height is

605
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,559
supposed to be an ounce i guess

606
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,520
but

607
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,919
it's really confusing i genuinely don't

608
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,720
know

609
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,840
um look it's fine so

610
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,400
i'm just gonna skip that but

611
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,280
in north america they all refer to it as

612
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,679
ounces everybody else does the same

613
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,400
measurement of minimum

614
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,240
all right

615
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,600
so now

616
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
tools there are so many tools when it

617
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,360
comes to leather work

618
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,360
and when you're doing

619
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,600
uh leather working right

620
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,039
and you thought security was bad with

621
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,520
the amount of tools so this is just a

622
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,679
little reference chart for all of the

623
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,520
skus that are available for some of the

624
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,039
tools that i'm going to show

625
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,120
and they they want you to bring this

626
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,000
back

627
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,640
to the store every time you go in

628
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,400
and you know just put a little dot like

629
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
oh i own this one i own this one it's

630
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,840
very much like pokemon they want you to

631
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,480
catch them all

632
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,360
so

633
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,400
how do we get a pattern onto leather

634
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,080
um

635
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,720
i hope you like tracing because

636
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,400
you have to trace it and you have to

637
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,320
trace it again you have to trace it a

638
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,600
third time

639
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
now the first time right it's just a

640
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,120
printout on paper

641
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,039
say hello to the um

642
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,799
pancakes coaster

643
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,600
so what you do is you get a clear film

644
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,919
and you put that over and then you draw

645
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,080
and trace everything out

646
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,799
so now you have the tracing film

647
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,960
so now that you have the tracing film

648
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,159
you need to

649
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,440
put this

650
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,760
onto the leather so now you take this

651
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,159
and you put that over and then you trace

652
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,760
it yet again onto the leather

653
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,120
there's a

654
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,600
special stylus that's used where it has

655
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,080
just a you know dull point

656
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,320
but you know you would when working with

657
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,640
leather because the

658
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,799
moisture has been all removed you have

659
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,480
to basically

660
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
you know wet the leather each time you

661
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,520
go to make impressions on it

662
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
so the next part and we'll go into more

663
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,159
detail here is where you carve and then

664
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,640
there's the tooling color final assembly

665
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,440
but all of those

666
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,919
processes each one has its own unique

667
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,640
set of tools

668
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,640
so let me

669
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,080
get my handy spray bottle

670
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,320
and i just sprayed a bunch of

671
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,960
electronics so that's going to go well

672
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,400
so once we have this we go ahead

673
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,039
and get the swivel knife now what this

674
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,400
knife does

675
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,360
is

676
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,600
it spins

677
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
so that you can make complex shapes now

678
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,919
this you know this is the finger rest

679
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,000
and as you go through

680
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,679
drag it

681
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,320
towards you

682
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,880
and that helps make you know curvy

683
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,720
shapes on

684
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
on the leather itself you know you're

685
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,039
supposed to

686
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,960
you know once you get the pattern in

687
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,919
here

688
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,000
um you would

689
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,760
go through and the whole point of this

690
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,000
knife is to

691
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,640
create emphasis on

692
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,279
the actual design so i had to go in and

693
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,200
carve this out so that

694
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,480
it's more prominent

695
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,200
all right

696
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
next step

697
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,039
next up is you have

698
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,120
the tooling and so you know there's a

699
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,679
solid surface where you can see here

700
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,200
this surface is um

701
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,159
a fake countertop slab

702
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,000
everybody says use granite or something

703
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,960
but i

704
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,039
literally went to

705
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,360
my local countertop shop and said hey do

706
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,039
you have some scraps the guy's like sure

707
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,559
and he gave me this

708
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,000
um and so what this is this solid

709
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,240
surface will basically allow you to

710
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,120
make sure that the impressions

711
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,799
are deep and noticeable so let me show

712
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,039
you how that actually works here so

713
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,640
wet the leather again

714
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,320
so now some of the tools that come up

715
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,880
here

716
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,440
we have

717
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,320
the

718
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,480
camouflage tool

719
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,000
don't ask me where they got these names

720
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,159
from i don't know

721
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,000
but this is the camouflage tool and what

722
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,200
this does

723
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,520
is

724
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,240
it

725
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,760
there's going to be a bit of a shaky cam

726
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,600
here so please uh

727
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,360
look away if you're sensitive i'll let

728
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,400
you know when it's safe

729
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,000
okay so

730
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,600
should things should have cleared up by

731
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,880
now

732
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,440
so what this does

733
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,240
is it just leaves this nice impression

734
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,559
let me show the there we go

735
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,360
and this one's kind of like a seashell

736
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,880
type shape

737
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,720
and you also have

738
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,799
the pear shader

739
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,360
the pear shader kind of allows you to do

740
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,799
contours around things so let me see if

741
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,799
i could do this and there's going to be

742
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,158
some more shaky cam here folks

743
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,760
so that's the pair shader

744
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,320
as you can see that's makes this nice

745
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,399
little contour where it's just

746
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,520
impressing

747
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,960
you know pressing in the leather just a

748
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
little bit there

749
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,919
next up is the beveler and what this

750
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,080
does is it kind of allows at a slant

751
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,960
it allows it to go in at a slant

752
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
um and all of this is

753
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
only the whole purpose of all of these

754
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,320
sorry baking can

755
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,159
purpose of all of these is to just add

756
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,640
like 3t 3d

757
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,399
layering to the leather when you're

758
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,240
doing some of that

759
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,960
so

760
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,039
you know this this goes in and does like

761
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,679
this nice solid um

762
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,159
it leaves it so that it's in

763
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,360
straight down

764
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,000
on this side but then it goes in at this

765
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,240
nice smooth bevel on that side

766
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,880
so the next tool that we have is the

767
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,760
veiner

768
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,480
and what this does

769
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,520
some more shaky cam

770
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,080
very similar where it just does this

771
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,440
nice

772
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,320
um

773
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,760
you know

774
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,480
grooved pattern and then this can be

775
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,840
used if you do it uh back and forth

776
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,399
what this can do is make various shapes

777
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,080
um

778
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,039
like borders and such so i'm gonna

779
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,200
here's the shaky cam one more time

780
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,320
so

781
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,600
it's not good

782
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,480
fine

783
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,919
and

784
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,760
you know you take a little bit more time

785
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,080
i'm feeling slightly rushed

786
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,840
you can line these up a little bit

787
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,080
better to make like a nice smooth curve

788
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,679
so the last

789
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,880
tool that we have is

790
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,120
the second to last

791
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,559
we have the

792
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,799
seeder and this does just basic dots and

793
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,799
you know if you're making a flower type

794
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,760
pattern

795
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,399
the dot will basically

796
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,640
um you know can be kind of like the

797
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
center of the flowers let me go ahead

798
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,720
and do

799
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,840
shaky cam again

800
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,559
if you go too hard you can actually

801
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,200
punch through the leather altogether

802
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,880
ain't that right

803
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,720
so

804
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,039
so now the next piece is backgrounder

805
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,480
and what this does

806
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,360
is

807
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,320
it

808
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,559
creates a nice

809
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,840
um

810
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,120
like uniform shape that just goes across

811
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,960
on the um

812
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,880
on the on the leather and you know you

813
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,200
can follow it along so there's going to

814
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,480
be some more shaky cam

815
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
not my best work

816
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,960
so here

817
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,960
as you can see it does this nice

818
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,120
see if i can make that a little bit

819
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,159
better

820
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,440
so it adds like a nice um

821
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,399
impression on there while it's

822
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,000
like depressing the leather down

823
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,159
so

824
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,679
next up

825
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,480
is

826
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,919
putting

827
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,840
and

828
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,120
you know the most common way is

829
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,200
a utility knife any utility knife will

830
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,960
do the main thing is to make sure that

831
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,919
it is sharp they always need to be sharp

832
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,679
leather is very

833
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,760
um very tough to cut through and when

834
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,799
you're doing cuts you would do

835
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,520
cuts that's

836
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,720
light and just keep making multiple

837
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,640
passes through it until you actually cut

838
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,559
all the way through

839
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,919
so this

840
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,279
i don't know who saw my tweet beforehand

841
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,480
this guy is the strap cutter and what

842
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,760
this does

843
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,320
is you select the various measurements

844
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,480
here right now it's currently set to one

845
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,320
inch

846
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,880
and you would tighten this down and what

847
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,159
this does is this can make

848
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,320
um a solid

849
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,799
like straight line that's its sole

850
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,440
purpose in life

851
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,840
so you would feed this

852
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,000
through and

853
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,440
there's a small razor blade right here

854
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,840
and what that razor blade does is just

855
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
slices right through

856
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,919
so you have to have a straight line all

857
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,600
the way down here because if you don't

858
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,320
then you're going to have a wobbly um

859
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,080
you know a wobbly line

860
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,919
so once you get it started

861
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,279
it's a little tough to get started

862
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,679
you would pull this through

863
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,360
and now

864
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,279
just this is

865
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,519
this is now making a split down the

866
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,519
leather like this so if i go all the way

867
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,200
through this piece

868
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,919
all the way down

869
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,320
this is going to give me one solid

870
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,679
like uniform cut of one inch all the way

871
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:18,960
down

872
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,519
so that's the purpose of the uh of the

873
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,600
strap cutter here this thing

874
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,559
um

875
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,919
it's like

876
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,399
10 or 15 dollars and it lasts a lifetime

877
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,678
so

878
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,640
the next fun thing is a stitch groover

879
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,679
and this you basically run it

880
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,559
down the edge of the leather

881
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,799
to make a groove

882
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,760
that

883
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,320
you can

884
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,960
use as a guide mark when you're punching

885
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,000
holes for stitching

886
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,880
so if we just run this down this follows

887
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,399
the nice clean edge that you just cut in

888
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,360
and

889
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,960
it leaves these nice little curly cues

890
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,000
which are so satisfying

891
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,919
so that's that's the whole purpose of

892
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,519
this this is adjustable you know it can

893
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,799
go out a good inch and a half or so

894
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,840
and you would punch holes down here

895
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,240
marry the sides up and you know sew it

896
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,399
together

897
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,200
so then now we've got

898
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,399
some skiving knives now these are scary

899
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,719
and

900
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,440
what we have is this one is a japanese

901
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,200
style that's the

902
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,120
what they what they call

903
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,480
the japanese style

904
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,000
skiving knife and the whole point of

905
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,360
this is to

906
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,240
shave the leather down so that it can be

907
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,200
um

908
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,279
go to a tapered point and so i'm just

909
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,360
going to do a little small section here

910
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,640
and

911
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,880
i'm working with live tools so please

912
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,679
excuse me if i'm not speaking

913
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,360
i don't want to slice my fingers off

914
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,120
these guys are extremely sharp

915
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,960
as you can see i just gouge it into the

916
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,719
paper here

917
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,679
so

918
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,280
if you'll notice

919
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,560
right

920
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,159
this um

921
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,679
you know this just

922
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,599
shaved this nice little portion off

923
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,879
right here

924
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,040
and so now it's coming to this tapered

925
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,719
point

926
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,879
and

927
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,960
knives need to be

928
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,480
closed up otherwise you get injuries

929
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,760
so this is another style

930
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,560
um

931
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,960
of skiving tool

932
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,679
and it just has a razor blade here and

933
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,000
same thing a similar principle it's just

934
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,839
this one's more awkward to work through

935
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,440
oh now the one time it wants to work

936
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,199
right

937
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,560
so yeah you would just kind of slowly

938
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,359
um

939
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,000
shave the leather this one's a lot

940
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,760
harder to control than the other ones so

941
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,720
i prefer the the japanese style

942
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,480
personally

943
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,640
alright so now that we have

944
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,920
made a mess

945
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,000
that just goes everywhere uh tim i got

946
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,920
to jump in with questions to to close

947
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,720
this out i'm sorry no problem i was just

948
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,560
wrapping up because i

949
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,960
oh look i'm out of time

950
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,760
uh so uh have you ever done any work

951
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,320
with mico leather which is uh made from

952
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,760
mushrooms

953
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,240
i have not no

954
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,480
um is there any need to replace the

955
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,119
blade on the strap cutter

956
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,800
yes yes that goes bad um every so often

957
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,359
or not bad just dull and yeah there's um

958
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,280
you would just remove

959
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,480
you would just remove the screw here um

960
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,240
the screws and then slide out the

961
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,400
slide out the razor there

962
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,000
and you could just buy a replacement for

963
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
it

964
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
uh and then um cdc or ccdc which uh you

965
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,480
you um play a large part in how have you

966
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,960
seen them incorporate a lot of what you

967
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,359
were talking about with the requirement

968
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,280
for storytelling with reporting and

969
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,599
documentation

970
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,920
so from that standpoint um i would say

971
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,880
that

972
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,800
uh

973
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,320
the

974
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,960
some of the reports that we get are

975
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,079
very

976
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,480
technical focused technical driven

977
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,119
and it's just like a big data dump and

978
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,520
it's not actually telling a story

979
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,880
so it's it's not saying that you know

980
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,560
the attacker got in

981
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,200
using these tools these procedures etc

982
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,240
it was

983
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,720
it was just

984
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,359
um you know bad guy got in new account

985
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,000
created done but like there's no context

986
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,200
there's no

987
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,599
understanding of how it got um how it

988
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,560
got into that state

989
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,520
all right any last things you'd like to

990
