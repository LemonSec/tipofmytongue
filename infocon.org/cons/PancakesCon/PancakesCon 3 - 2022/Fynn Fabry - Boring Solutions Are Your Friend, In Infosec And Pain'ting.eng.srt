1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,800
up now is finn fabry and they have a

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,720
wonderful talk entitled boring solutions

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,520
are your friend in infosec and painting

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,320
take it away finn

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,480
yes thank you for the introduction and

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,920
thank you for having me

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,239
uh as the title already suggests we're

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,920
going to talk about boring solutions

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,080
today which doesn't mean that the

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,400
solutions are necessarily going to be

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,279
you know

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,080
all easygoing and everything but they

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,920
are considered quite boring and you will

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,840
soon see why

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,599
first let me take away my headphones

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,280
because now i just have to speak and

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,960
don't have to listen

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
and then we can give it a go

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,719
i will start with the introduction of

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,719
our acting character in this one or the

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,879
first acting character of several

22
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,360
to demonstrate a little with an everyday

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,280
example

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,280
i'm a bit hesitant to call it every day

25
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,120
but it was every day for the last two

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,440
years

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,160
we are going to start with

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,399
me clicking on the wrong screen

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,640
with our favorite tech bro

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,600
i'm pretty sure you all know or have an

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,519
idea in your mind what i mean when i say

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,720
tech pro

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,400
and if you don't please look at the

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,680
slide here

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,600
and imagine the type any resemblance of

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,759
iron men is purely

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,439
not based on the characteristic that

38
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,600
they think they can save the world

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,320
and they did try if you would like to

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,400
remember with me together

41
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,880
about two or three years ago

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,799
a little issue started that is keeping

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,960
us all kind of busy right now

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,880
and of course our favorite czech bros

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,880
which do not represent the entire tech

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,040
community but just a certain type

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,119
decided that this is again their point

48
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,520
to save the world

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,680
in this example they decided

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
collectively or not collectively but a

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,680
lot of them cropped up in my timeline

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
and probably a lot of you have seen it

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,840
as well starting to engineer ventilators

54
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,159
like hospital ventilators

55
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,240
and this is a very

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,880
this is a very noble goal like hospital

57
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,719
ventilators are

58
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,560
an important thing an important gadget

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,000
to work with

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,880
but also as it turned out pretty quickly

61
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,479
that them engineering them didn't solve

62
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,120
any problems for two reasons one they

63
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,080
would have

64
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,879
needed years to develop actual medical

65
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,640
grade ventilators

66
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,720
and second

67
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,200
hospital staff didn't actually need an

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
enormous amount of more ventilators one

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
thing that they probably would have

70
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,520
needed and they still need is more staff

71
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,599
but you cannot easily engineer it and

72
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,120
another thing that they quickly brought

73
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
up that people needed also outside of

74
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,400
hospitals

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,000
were face masks and ppe was running in

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,840
short supply at that point

77
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,920
so basically what they were saying again

78
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,640
and again is if you want to help out

79
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,360
go home and sew some masks

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,840
and in this cut a little example that is

81
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,920
not part of

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,680
tech

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,760
in detail but like

84
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,040
it just gives you an image of the issue

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,239
sewing cloth masks was

86
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,280
by

87
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
this demographic the tech bros

88
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,360
considered to be very boring you know

89
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,280
somebody else could do it

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,159
somebody else could just do it as they

91
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,959
like to insist but there is no

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,040
just about that

93
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,080
it is a very important task it is a task

94
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,159
that does not require an enormous amount

95
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,640
of skill but some type of skill

96
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,959
and it requires people's time and it

97
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,840
just wasn't being done in the amount it

98
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,920
would have been required i mean there

99
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,000
were other things that they also could

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,519
have done they could have gone shopping

101
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,519
for the elderly neighbors and everything

102
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,280
but they decided to focus on that thing

103
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,400
that is you know innovative and

104
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,360
prestigious and interesting and not on

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,959
boring solutions

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,480
that actually might have helped someone

107
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,760
out

108
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,799
now in our everyday life

109
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,000
um

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,120
these people

111
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,360
don't really go around trying to

112
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,040
engineer things for hospitals on a

113
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,480
day-to-day basis

114
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,319
but they do work for big corporations

115
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,799
with basically the same mindset i am

116
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,360
going to go out there and save the world

117
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,080
now what does that look like

118
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,920
again we want

119
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,480
interesting fascinating solutions that

120
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,399
going to get that are going to guarantee

121
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,880
you fame and people looking up to you

122
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,960
and being like oh wow what a what a man

123
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,759
like for example currently

124
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,720
blockchain you know if you are the the

125
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,960
guy who understands blockchain you are

126
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,000
probably

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
going to get somewhere in your career

128
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,280
or

129
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,080
and exchange this for several

130
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,360
currently in style topics like

131
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,479
artificial intelligence nfts and what

132
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,240
have you whatever is going to be the

133
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
next

134
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,639
great fad

135
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:48,980
um

136
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,320
[Music]

137
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,400
but the problem is i yet have to

138
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
encounter

139
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,320
an issue that is resolved by blockchain

140
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,080
there are some issues that might be

141
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,800
resolved by artificial intelligence but

142
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
uh let's let's

143
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
let's uh

144
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,639
burn that bridge when we get to it

145
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,600
so

146
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,160
you know our executive here is not very

147
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,840
impressed because

148
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,800
yes this is a very nice blockchain but

149
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,479
it's not solving my problem or at least

150
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,240
that is what we would be expecting to

151
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,560
happen what actually often happens is

152
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,120
that in technology the topic is hyped

153
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,039
and everybody wants it no matter how

154
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,800
good it is for the problem

155
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,639
and the executive is going to be over

156
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,400
the moon but

157
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,639
the actual and reasonable reaction would

158
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,440
be

159
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,680
to be kind of disappointed that this is

160
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,400
your solution to cyber security risks

161
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,680
because

162
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,639
it doesn't actually solve anything

163
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,720
the question is what is the cloth masks

164
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,960
and going shopping for elderlies in this

165
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,240
situation what could you actually do

166
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,039
and

167
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,280
well might be boring

168
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,560
this is what we're going to talk about

169
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,520
now

170
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,440
one of these things from my experience

171
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,160
with companies in varying sizes to the

172
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,479
point of like international companies

173
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,160
handling a lot of money

174
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,440
was

175
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,919
an asset management database or a

176
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,800
computer management database

177
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,360
now when i talked about that to some

178
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,960
friends when i started working with

179
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,280
companies like that they were like

180
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,160
but aren't you a consultant for cyber

181
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,440
security

182
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,800
wouldn't you be looking for

183
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,199
vulnerabilities or something

184
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,560
isn't this like not a security topic but

185
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,759
more like a general i.t topic and oh

186
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,000
sorry i keep clicking

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,120
and basically they are not wrong but

188
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,440
the problem at hand is that a lot of

189
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,000
companies do not have such databases or

190
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
matter of fact they have several of them

191
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,880
and these databases contain conflicting

192
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,400
information

193
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,720
if you take a closer look they do not

194
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,560
actually contain all the assets that

195
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,479
they have they contain assets that they

196
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,199
had 10 years ago but that they are there

197
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,720
that are gone now

198
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,240
so basically they somehow have this

199
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,280
thing

200
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,560
but

201
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,880
maintaining it cleaning it up in the

202
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,599
first place or maybe even establishing

203
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,319
it if that's not a thing right now

204
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,960
is a lot of work to do

205
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,360
and unfortunately for our dear tech bro

206
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,080
this work is not very prestigious and

207
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,639
shiny and innovative

208
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,720
uh cmdbs are

209
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,800
tried and tested technology you know

210
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,919
it's it's a database that contains data

211
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,560
the important part and the artistic part

212
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,039
and the part that is actually worth your

213
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,319
money is

214
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,759
the part where you aggregate and sort

215
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,919
and update the data that is in the

216
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,199
database

217
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,919
but this again is not a very innovative

218
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,199
and very prestigious task to do right

219
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,479
but assuming

220
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,400
that our good friend here actually wants

221
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,840
to help out

222
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,599
i guess he's going to have to acquire

223
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,080
some other skills then building a

224
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,319
blockchain so let's take a quick look at

225
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,000
the skills that you might need for this

226
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,080
network knowledge by which i mean

227
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,000
network as in computer networks like

228
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,440
net networks consist not only of laptops

229
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,759
that you stick to a networking cable but

230
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,680
they consist of a lot of things there

231
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,840
are routers there's switches there are

232
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,800
servers there are end products what have

233
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,479
you there's a lot of stuff in there you

234
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,080
know you have to know how to handle it

235
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,639
how to handle all the protocols and for

236
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,240
this job of keeping a cmdb updated or

237
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,839
aggregating all the data you don't have

238
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,919
to be the networking guru that could

239
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,039
just bootstrap a company-wide network

240
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,599
but you should have heard about how

241
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,679
things connect together so you know

242
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,680
basic networking knowledge

243
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,600
networking in the sense of talking to

244
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,000
people because the assets that you are

245
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,720
trying to catalog are run created and

246
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,279
dismantled by people so

247
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,600
you know interacting with them is kind

248
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,519
of a necessity there will always be

249
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,680
situations even if you have a good

250
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,440
process in place

251
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,600
where you will find out somebody's not

252
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,519
playing according to playing along the

253
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,440
book somebody's doing something else you

254
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,279
have to find out why to prevent this in

255
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,480
the future

256
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,560
or you have to find out

257
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,720
why somebody decided to put wrong things

258
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,040
into the database or whatnot you have to

259
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,640
talk to people because they are running

260
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,839
the assets that you need to secure

261
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,080
then some kind of bookkeeping in the

262
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,160
sense that you have to check regularly

263
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,760
that your update processes and

264
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,360
everything is working

265
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,760
and that your database is actually

266
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,120
functioning

267
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,640
and last but not least something that i

268
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,440
did a lot in that phase of my career

269
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,720
sorting and analyzing data especially

270
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,440
really badly structured data because

271
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,600
there's going to be a lot of it it

272
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,440
probably contains most of the

273
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,519
information that you need

274
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,399
but it's not in any shape that you could

275
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,200
just

276
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,000
dump it in a database and call it a day

277
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,040
it's just

278
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,200
badly structured full of errors

279
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,640
unescaped

280
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,680
signs

281
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,279
you get things with

282
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,519
different formats from different sites

283
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,760
and have to aggregate them into one

284
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,920
cohesive database so

285
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,880
if this is a profile where you see

286
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,920
yourself as oh wow that sounds like

287
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,680
something i could do or that i would

288
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,360
want to do

289
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,959
yeah this is something that is currently

290
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,560
not being done because a lot of people

291
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,040
in cyber security consider this a very

292
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,079
very boring solution

293
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,839
well

294
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,000
assuming you do not think that way and

295
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,839
you are still offering blockchains to

296
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,160
disappointed executives what else might

297
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,399
they be disappointed about

298
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,880
well that your blockchain is not a

299
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,120
vulnerability management

300
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,560
tool

301
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,760
maybe you could in some way in some way

302
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,440
include blockchain and vulnerability

303
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,600
management and probably someone's doing

304
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,839
that but also probably that system they

305
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,680
are building is not going to solve any

306
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,560
issues soon so let's rather take a look

307
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,240
at the things with which you could

308
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,640
actually help with vulnerability

309
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,959
management in medium to large sized

310
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,360
companies

311
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,399
one skill is tracking which

312
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,040
is not actually a huge skill set that

313
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,360
you need it is a skill set that you need

314
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,200
but it's not that huge

315
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,160
and the readiness to just stick to it to

316
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,560
just keep going keep tracking the things

317
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,760
and keep looking at the points where

318
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
things are not progressing

319
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,720
again talking to people oh well the

320
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,120
vulnerabilities that you are tracking

321
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,279
are on systems that again are run by

322
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,519
people and

323
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,519
these people are not

324
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,560
usually

325
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,360
neglecting updates patches and

326
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,120
configurations out of malicious intent

327
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,440
they are doing this for various reasons

328
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,519
and if you want to do vulnerability

329
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,600
management in a way that actually makes

330
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
things better

331
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,600
you have to understand those reasons

332
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,279
and try to

333
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,959
either enable the people to

334
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,560
work on it despite these reasons

335
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,600
existing

336
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,079
or to find ways when in which they don't

337
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,560
have to deal with these issues

338
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,800
so this is a lot more than the idea of

339
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,399
i'm gonna do a pen test and then dump

340
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,160
all of it into a database that collects

341
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,920
vulnerabilities and then people are

342
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,200
going to fix it right which

343
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,120
is something i have seen a lot of people

344
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,399
say

345
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,320
and this is just not how vulnerabilities

346
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,279
get fixed this is how they get collected

347
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,200
in a database

348
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,360
to watch

349
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,880
the next thing ties into that talking to

350
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,959
people actually the next two things

351
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,519
prioritizing and looking up solutions

352
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,959
because

353
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,120
i have talked to a lot of people who

354
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,040
seemed completely stunned by the amount

355
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,880
of the work that they had to do in

356
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,800
maintaining systems

357
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,880
and then on top of that they got the

358
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,200
output of some vulnerability scanner and

359
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,440
it just said look here are these glaring

360
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,760
red problems with your system you have

361
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,800
to fix them all and

362
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,720
well what can i say

363
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
it didn't get fixed

364
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,040
and then i did something

365
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,330
um

366
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,560
[Music]

367
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,959
it felt to me like a task that is not

368
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,160
even worth anything because it was like

369
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,560
just looking at these outposts of the

370
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,720
vulnerability man of the vulnerability

371
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,760
scanner

372
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,959
and then

373
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,480
sending out these issues with

374
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,399
instructions to fix them that i

375
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,760
basically

376
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,399
wrote out of some tech tutorial on

377
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,560
youtube and put this in an email and

378
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,519
sent this to the person responsible for

379
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,279
this system

380
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,240
and

381
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,240
later i got feedback from them that this

382
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,639
was a really valuable service to them

383
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,120
because i took the prioritizing

384
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,800
and the overwhelming amount of

385
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,639
information that they had to process in

386
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,440
order to find out how to patch

387
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,240
and

388
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,079
chunked it down into

389
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,639
one email for them to just follow along

390
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
and even if in the process of catching

391
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,120
they realized that the patching was

392
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,600
actually a little bit more

393
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,000
uh complex than what i wrote down

394
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
they were at the task now and they were

395
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,880
at that one test that they had to do so

396
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,279
they said this was an immense help while

397
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,519
other people especially people in cyber

398
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,079
security were like but that's not even a

399
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,000
task right

400
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,760
well it is and it is one that is

401
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,279
worthwhile

402
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,920
and then i put down their

403
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,839
finding vulnerabilities

404
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,800
in brackets because this is the one

405
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,839
thing that we got down and this is

406
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:40,959
well

407
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,959
sometimes it's boring and sometimes it's

408
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,480
exciting and fun

409
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,079
but anyway this is the point where you

410
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,240
don't have to argue with people in cyber

411
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,760
security that this has to be done they

412
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,880
are pretty much on top of that that's

413
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,120
fantastic everybody agrees fantastic and

414
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,760
red teaming and

415
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,680
scanners are a good thing

416
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
but telling people how to patch their

417
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,639
stuff apparently is not

418
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,519
okay again you are still trying to

419
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,000
impress the executive with

420
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
shiny golden blockchain but they are

421
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,639
still disappointed because

422
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,560
it's not for vulnerability management

423
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,600
not asset management and it's not

424
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,399
a tool to raise awareness

425
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,079
raising awareness

426
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:24,839
is

427
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,360
something if you tell that to somebody

428
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,279
from cyber security from the technical

429
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
part of cyber security very often you

430
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,120
get people

431
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,959
looking down at you like

432
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,160
excuse me this is the social issue

433
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,759
we don't deal with

434
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,360
social here

435
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,920
this is a human issue

436
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,680
but looking at reports

437
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,079
the social issue is a big one the fbi

438
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,240
and some reports suggested that probably

439
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,040
a quarter to a third of really

440
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,399
successful attacks on companies

441
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,160
i presume in the us they didn't say that

442
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,600
but i presume they measured it in the

443
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,480
u.s

444
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,320
were initiated by phishing or similar

445
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,040
kinds of social engineering so

446
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,959
the problem was people

447
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,639
and we cannot

448
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,040
put that problem aside by just saying oh

449
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,680
well then they have to behave more

450
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,279
secure

451
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,199
because guess what if you say that they

452
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,440
are not going to change anything

453
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
behave more securely is not an

454
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,759
instruction especially not for someone

455
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,440
whose primary

456
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,320
uh

457
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,240
guild of work is not

458
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,920
cyber security but

459
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,759
anything else

460
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,360
so

461
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,600
this is actually a task that we have to

462
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,560
be

463
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
aware of and that we have to take care

464
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,560
of we as people who know about cyber

465
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,839
security

466
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,920
but what kind of skills do we need there

467
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,079
it might come to as an absolute surprise

468
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,880
to you but the probably most important

469
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,759
part is talking to people because you

470
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,120
have to make these people understand

471
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,279
what the issue is and why this issue is

472
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,320
important

473
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,600
then we have

474
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,759
more skills that basically tie into

475
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,119
talking to people you need empathy

476
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,959
if you do any of the previous tasks i

477
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,319
talked about and you don't really have a

478
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,839
lot of empathy that's okay you're

479
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,480
talking to people about technology

480
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,640
here you are talking to people about

481
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,359
their behavior as humans so you need

482
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,720
empathy

483
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,480
first off in order to understand their

484
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,919
problems that you want to work out with

485
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,720
them and second to talk to them in a way

486
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,280
that they actually listen to you

487
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,880
if they feel like you're condescending

488
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,720
them or if they don't understand word of

489
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,080
what you're saying because you're far

490
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,760
too technical

491
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,679
it's not going to reach anyone and it's

492
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,000
not going to do any good so you need

493
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,120
empathy you need presentation skills

494
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,400
which is a conglomerate of

495
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,080
squishy skills

496
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,520
again a thing that

497
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,039
cyber security

498
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,919
um communities don't really

499
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,679
like to work with

500
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,520
on a large

501
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,360
uh like a lot of them don't like to work

502
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,400
with it

503
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,679
there is a

504
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,280
growing group of people who like to work

505
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,520
with it and this is great but

506
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,280
a lot of people are like

507
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
ah i don't know

508
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,200
this is not a web server

509
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,960
gotta stay clear of it but yeah

510
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
presentation skills

511
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,679
things like talking fluently preparing

512
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,120
material that people stay focused on

513
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,880
how even works focused you know how

514
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,400
focus works if you want to give a

515
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,200
presentation better think about it

516
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,799
design as part of presentations but also

517
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,640
as part of for example if you want to

518
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,160
design a handout

519
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,559
or if you want to design a poster or a

520
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,799
website that informs people about things

521
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,640
that are important

522
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,400
and last but not least you should know

523
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,480
about social engineering

524
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,039
there are some minor technical security

525
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,480
loopholes that you also should know

526
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,559
about but mainly if you want to raise

527
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,720
awareness for cyber security

528
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,679
social engineering is something that you

529
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,160
want to at least theoretically know

530
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,720
about because this is what is going to

531
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,000
help you

532
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,080
to tell people what the danger is where

533
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,039
the danger is coming from

534
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,559
so we have three things now that you can

535
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,360
help

536
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,520
big companies with

537
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,600
and i can promise you that

538
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,760
they are going to appreciate it there

539
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,520
are some medium and small-sized

540
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,799
companies that are not going to

541
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,559
appreciate it because all of these three

542
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,480
topics have one in common

543
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,320
they are a lot of work and they have to

544
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
pay for that work

545
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,360
but

546
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,400
in

547
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,840
the last two years i have seen a

548
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,440
constantly growing

549
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,080
awareness in companies that this is

550
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,640
actually an important thing to do

551
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,080
and that this is something that they

552
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,039
have to

553
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,000
pay money and other resources on to fix

554
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,440
it so

555
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,360
if you are maybe in the situation that

556
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,240
you think is cyber security a place for

557
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,840
me to work in and you were so far scared

558
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,919
by people telling you

559
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,400
that you can't because you are not

560
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,880
technical enough and you don't know

561
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,200
enough about hacking

562
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,240
um yes through that here are some

563
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,919
options there are more but here are some

564
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:10,880
options

565
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,159
how when

566
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,880
having a minimum amount of knowledge of

567
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,520
you know the hard security practices

568
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,559
you can make a significant improvement

569
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,880
to the cyber security of a company

570
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,760
this was the part about cyber security i

571
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,400
have to quickly change my setup a bit so

572
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,480
i am going to give you

573
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,960
a standby screen because i have to shift

574
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,720
the camera and i don't want you to get

575
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,520
motion sickness

576
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,600
oh wait that doesn't actually block out

577
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,440
the camera that i have to shift never

578
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,360
mind then i'm gonna take over the camera

579
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,280
and you have to deal with it

580
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,080
and then we are going to go to the

581
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,678
art part of this talk

582
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,440
um

583
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
because

584
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,039
not really that surprisingly

585
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,559
um the idea that

586
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,200
you can do

587
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,760
simple well non-complex things that are

588
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,039
quite boring

589
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,120
in order to improve your life

590
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,880
is not limited to cyber security so

591
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,000
let's go over here

592
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,520
and travel to my sketchbook

593
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,840
i have to adjust my camera so you still

594
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,039
see my face the most important part of

595
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,600
you know becoming an artist

596
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,799
sketchbook

597
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,200
uh thank you to my technical support

598
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,760
i'm just gonna work with this now

599
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,559
uh yeah the sketchbook um i'm pretty

600
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,240
sure you have heard about the fact that

601
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,960
pretty much any artist has one

602
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,760
this is mine or rather my

603
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,440
i think seventh or eighth sketchbook

604
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,159
seventh that's what it says on the back

605
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,280
um

606
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,120
but

607
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,600
let's get down to the issue that i want

608
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,240
to talk about in art which is the basic

609
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,000
issue of art let's say you want to

610
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,840
become an artist

611
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,799
and

612
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,240
you don't have what people call talent

613
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,000
um

614
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,400
a lot of people approach me and say they

615
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,080
don't have talent so they cannot become

616
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,320
an artist and i oh yeah it's focused

617
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,360
good

618
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,120
um

619
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,880
but talent is

620
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,720
kinda overrated

621
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,400
maybe you have heard that said a lot

622
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,520
before

623
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,280
but today we're going to talk about what

624
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
you can do instead of talent so our

625
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,760
overarching issue here is you want to

626
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,360
paint pictures

627
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,240
but you can't

628
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,159
first question is why can't you and

629
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,840
there are

630
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,320
two factors that i want to focus on

631
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,280
today

632
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,520
and show you how to eliminate these

633
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,039
factors factor number one is your hands

634
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,400
because

635
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,720
we tend to think that our hands can do

636
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,559
what we want them to do just because we

637
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,240
think about it and in many aspects

638
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,280
that's right

639
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,080
if you are a skilled cook your hands can

640
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,000
cut up everything that you want to cut

641
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,120
real quick

642
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
and stuff like that but you didn't get

643
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,240
there without practicing

644
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,320
and in art we can do the same so

645
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,400
the first thing that you want to do

646
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,039
in schooling your hand how to work as an

647
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,520
artist hand is

648
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,320
uh if you want to try that with me now

649
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,400
grab a piece of paper and do it you want

650
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,039
to draw a line

651
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,600
uh and then you want to do that again

652
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,000
and again

653
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,919
and basically you just keep doing this

654
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,600
you know this is your first boring thing

655
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,240
that you can do if you want to

656
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,679
create art

657
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,440
draw lines

658
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,240
when you have made a lot of lines and

659
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,320
in the long run i guess you want to make

660
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,400
something like i guess a few hundred two

661
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,720
thousand lines just lines you know not

662
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,840
incorporated in images just lines

663
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,440
you can start trying to do something

664
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,840
else that is fun which is

665
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,080
you see that line here the lowest one i

666
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,480
want to trace that again

667
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,799
and as you see i have made some wobbles

668
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,080
below

669
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,320
but overall i pretty much hit the line

670
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,840
here i made a little wobble up there and

671
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,520
then you do that and you do that again

672
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,919
until you have a line that is so thick

673
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,440
that you don't even see any more when

674
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,720
you're wobbling around and then you

675
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,640
start with the next one

676
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,360
as you can also see i am i am not moving

677
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,039
my wrist here this is something that you

678
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,919
can read in theory on how to

679
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,240
move your hands and your pen

680
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,200
so

681
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
just a quick thing

682
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,760
if i try to do lines like this

683
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,360
the amount of straight line that i can

684
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,520
do is very limited because

685
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,600
i can only move my wrists and fingers so

686
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,760
far so what you want to do is draw from

687
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,880
the elbow or from the shoulder

688
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,480
preferably from the shoulder do as much

689
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,240
from the shoulder as you can so just

690
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,720
move your entire arm i am saying just

691
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,400
like this is an easy task

692
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,799
if you're just starting out it's not

693
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,840
and this is your first boring task do a

694
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,520
lot of lines

695
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,640
um

696
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,200
trying this actually trying it on paper

697
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,520
is going to show you that this is boring

698
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,360
but probably need it if you have never

699
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,559
drawn before

700
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,640
and when you're done with these you can

701
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,480
also try to do

702
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,640
a wavy line

703
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,679
and then trace that as you see i just

704
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,440
completely went off the bed here because

705
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,159
you don't just have images consisting of

706
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,840
straight lines you have images

707
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,960
consisting of all kinds of lines so

708
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,600
you want to be able to do the line in

709
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,440
the shape that you want where you want

710
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,080
it otherwise you have a beautiful

711
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,320
picture in your hand and you need that

712
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,360
picture to contain i don't know a

713
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,039
triangle

714
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,480
and this is the triangle that you

715
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
imagined but what you actually end up

716
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,279
with is this this doesn't get you are

717
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,080
going to get you anywhere no matter of

718
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,520
the rest of your skills and your

719
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,960
imagination

720
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,720
so you do this you

721
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,840
do wavy lines you do circles triangles

722
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,880
whatever

723
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,480
boxes

724
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,120
and this is training your hand

725
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,200
to do what you want

726
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
the other thing that follows after that

727
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,880
is trying to do gradients with whatever

728
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,760
medium you are going to use in this case

729
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,600
i have a pencil but maybe you want to

730
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,559
use

731
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,600
liners markers um

732
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,679
acrylic or oil paint

733
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,400
and of course you know you can do a very

734
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,480
dark streak with a pencil you can do a

735
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,640
very light streak with a pencil and then

736
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,480
you try to make a

737
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,720
smooth gradient from one end to the

738
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,880
other and at the beginning you're going

739
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,720
to see that

740
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,039
the um

741
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,600
here the the shift from very very dark

742
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
to somewhat dark is pretty quick and

743
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,919
then you have a slow shift where it

744
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,840
always goes lighter

745
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,760
which is not that good because i haven't

746
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,279
practiced that much gradients in recent

747
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,320
times so this gradient is okay-ish but

748
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,679
it's not very

749
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,640
even

750
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,880
so this is another thing you can do this

751
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,640
teaches you how to control the pressure

752
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,720
that you exert onto the paper

753
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,640
and this of course differs from every

754
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,159
medium to another

755
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:16,880
but

756
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,399
the more you practice this with

757
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,399
different media the easier it's going to

758
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,320
get for you with the next because

759
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,919
there's also something in your head in

760
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,720
your mind that you practice with that

761
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,200
and of course in your vision

762
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,120
and basically

763
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,200
that brings us to the next thing we now

764
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,399
have

765
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,440
talked about your hand trying to make

766
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,679
even shapes trying to end up drawing

767
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,840
again where you want it to draw or not

768
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,480
in that case

769
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,520
and

770
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,440
this is nice so

771
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,679
lines now end up where you want them

772
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:52,640
but

773
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,880
the next thing that you will

774
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,399
see if you actually care to um to

775
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,919
observe it is

776
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,159
that you also have to train your eyes i

777
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,840
would like to point at my eyes now but

778
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,399
i'm working on limited tech here so

779
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,200
um you want to to train your eyes to

780
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,520
actually see what is around you now that

781
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,440
sounds kind of dumb because of course

782
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
you see what is around you

783
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,279
but

784
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,000
you don't probably there are some people

785
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,919
who do but mostly only if they have

786
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,480
worked with painting or photography or

787
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,640
something like that

788
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,480
and a nice experiment that somebody did

789
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,679
on that was

790
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,240
they told people to draw a bike like a

791
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,960
regular old bicycle and

792
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,120
people should draw it

793
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,600
abstract and minimal minimal as they

794
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,240
wanted and a very common

795
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,480
like

796
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,559
the results were not as

797
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,480
uniform as you would imagine them to be

798
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,520
because we all ride similar bikes

799
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,760
but they had some

800
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,880
common factors like for example they all

801
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,799
had two

802
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,440
tire two tires two wheels

803
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,880
then another thing that was pretty

804
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,840
common was there is a saddle

805
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,120
and the cell very often was here above

806
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,559
the

807
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,399
line wheel

808
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,200
and we had a handlebar that was above

809
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,799
the front wheel

810
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,559
something like that

811
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,559
and we need a connection between these

812
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,760
and

813
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,039
sometimes the paddles were here

814
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,399
or sometimes they were here

815
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,159
i'm gonna go with here

816
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,080
and then you need connections you have

817
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,159
something like this

818
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,799
and then probably something like this

819
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,880
because bikes have something triangular

820
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,760
right

821
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,480
and if you now draw up a pull up a

822
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,000
picture of a bike somewhere on the

823
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,440
internet you will see that this is

824
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,600
absolutely wrong the only thing that is

825
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,039
correct here is that

826
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,760
the parts are there but

827
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,480
oh and the wheels are on the same height

828
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,120
that's that's basically it

829
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,360
and the paddles are between the

830
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,039
wheels but sometimes the pedals and the

831
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,679
drawings actually were here

832
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,000
when you now look at bikes like if he

833
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,600
went outside now and would look at a

834
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,279
bike because i primed you like that to

835
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,360
look at it then you would see that

836
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,200
actually you have a hind wheel you have

837
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
a front wheel

838
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,840
the

839
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,760
handlebar is kind of here but also like

840
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,159
a little more here it's not above the

841
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,840
way up above the middle of the wheel but

842
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,840
a bit above the wheel and then you have

843
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,520
this swoopy

844
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,240
thing that connects it to the wheel

845
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,559
um

846
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,080
i'm sorry

847
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,520
then you have the saddle the saddle is

848
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,799
not at all above the hind wheel it's

849
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,159
maybe a little bit above here

850
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,840
and then the connection to the hind

851
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,600
wheel is like this

852
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,919
and you have a connection like this

853
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,320
uh the pedals are actually here that's

854
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,279
right

855
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,960
and then you have something like that

856
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,200
and something like that

857
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,159
and

858
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,000
some kind of connection between the

859
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,480
saddle and the handlebar either like

860
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,880
this if it's a bike for people who have

861
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,480
issues with

862
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,640
raising their legs very far or for more

863
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,519
sportive bikes it's probably here

864
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,519
and sometimes you have something to put

865
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,480
luggage on here or maybe you have a

866
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,600
kind of basket here but basically this

867
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,240
is much closer to a bike than this but

868
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,399
this is something a lot of people drew

869
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,799
because they don't really look at bikes

870
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,240
and why would they they don't need it

871
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,000
this is not flaming them for being

872
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,480
stupid they just take in information

873
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,240
that is important to them

874
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,679
and the fact that the saddle is not

875
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,840
above the hind wheel but here is not

876
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,320
really important to their everyday lives

877
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,120
and this is just one example you walk

878
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,640
through your life

879
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,600
not seeing things or rather interpreting

880
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,200
them in this way

881
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,519
when they are like this but when you

882
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,120
start to draw

883
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
you have to get rid of this you have to

884
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,799
learn how to actually look at things

885
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,880
which is what i mean when i say you have

886
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,320
to school your eyes

887
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,600
so again

888
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,159
with the boring things

889
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,919
this is a little less than just boring

890
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,320
stuff then a little less boring than

891
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,720
just drawing straight lines this is a

892
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,200
bit more exciting which is

893
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,360
you start drawing things that you see

894
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,519
and please do yourself a favor don't

895
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,720
take the most exciting things start with

896
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,679
simple

897
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:16,480
and

898
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,120
so-called boring things

899
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,559
one nice thing i felt is an apple

900
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,720
if i tell you to draw an apple you would

901
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,440
probably end up with something close to

902
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
well that's a bit that's a bit pointy

903
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,320
here

904
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,240
let's start that again

905
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,679
better

906
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,919
something like this

907
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,039
and then you would throw in a stem

908
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,559
and

909
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,760
the rest of the flower here and it's

910
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,919
always sitting around there and you look

911
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,519
at an actual apple and again you see

912
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,039
that the actual apple looks very

913
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,720
different because if you look at it from

914
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,799
the side you don't see that dip here

915
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,200
that dip definitely exists it's there

916
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,960
but if you look at it from the side you

917
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,320
just see

918
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
this continuous line here

919
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,559
you hardly see anything of the dip same

920
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,679
here

921
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,480
but if you draw it like that just in a

922
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,559
comic where you only have the outlines

923
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,120
it's harder to recognize this is why you

924
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,000
see

925
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
apples painted like this very often

926
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,600
because with the dip here it's clearly

927
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,519
recognized as an apple

928
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,279
and it's much more

929
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,799
characteristic

930
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,840
if i just draw this as a almost circle

931
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,600
it could also be a home grenade i guess

932
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,320
but this like actually looking at it

933
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,559
and then going from there to the point

934
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,760
where you

935
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,840
stylize it for example by putting the

936
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,519
dip here

937
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,399
this is an entire arch of looking at

938
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,640
things and learning how to draw them so

939
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,480
you start out by looking at the thing

940
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,159
that is sitting in front of you and

941
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,399
drawing it the way that you see it

942
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,279
so

943
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,360
an apple would really be more

944
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,399
like

945
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,719
this

946
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
and this is again this is harder to

947
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,960
recognize as an apple

948
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,279
because the other aspects help you but

949
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,039
you first want to actually make sure

950
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,279
that you see the world the way it looks

951
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,520
uh now you have that down you can go the

952
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,639
entire road again with color so far i'm

953
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,800
just doing pencil sketches

954
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,280
you can start shading this is all stuff

955
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,440
that you just have to do a lot so this

956
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,040
is again the boring part you have to

957
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,280
draw a lot of these simple images you

958
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,359
have to shade them in very simple ways

959
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,280
and do yourself a favor and don't spend

960
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,599
an enormous amount of time on them

961
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,839
they've been fantastic fantastic sketch

962
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,918
here i know the technical difficulties

963
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,320
help uh kind of bled us into the uh

964
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,399
to time there uh unfortunately i don't

965
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,239
have time to ask you any questions but i

966
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,520
did want to thank you so much for

967
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,079
joining and uh giving us a wonderful

968
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,199
talk on uh boring solutions and uh kind

969
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,440
of practicing those fundamentals and uh

970
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,760
making those a big part of uh your

971
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,440
infosec solutions as well as the

972
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,760
wonderful drawing skills here i noticed

973
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,240
wonderful drawings uh and painting on

974
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,079
your slides i think there were some

975
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,079
questions about how how in the world you

976
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,599
painted those and things like that so

977
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,040
maybe jump in the chat or give us some

978
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,359
info about that we can pop into the chat

979
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,720
because uh some folks were really

980
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,240
wanting to know how how you did that

981
