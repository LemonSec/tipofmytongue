1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,399
with that i will pass things over to max

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,919
and by the way max you asked in the

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,399
channel what's our favorite horror movie

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,400
and my favorite horror movie is the ring

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,920
so there you go

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,480
okay i will show i will actually have

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,519
the ring on my slides

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,600
as i share my slides is a swedish horror

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,640
movie

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,320
uh which is called let the right one in

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,840
okay so

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,719
let's start so hi i'm going to talk

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,239
about horror movies a lot of emojis and

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,040
making better cyber security board games

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,360
so you see uh

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,640
i'm from germany and i work for a large

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,000
company there

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
i work in a i.t security department and

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,559
i do mostly risk management stuff so

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,280
this talk will focus a little bit on the

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
cyber security management part

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,600
of cyber security

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,199
and as you know

24
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,360
in germany we love to play board games

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,520
so uh every year around 4 000 new board

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,720
games are released and there is one

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,200
place on earth where you can play them

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,080
all

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,960
and that's spiel messe essen

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,439
it's uh in the city of essen

31
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,560
so if you would like to come to us to

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,040
germany to play board games in essen

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,720
you would have to go probably by air

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,439
which is would be the easiest way

35
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,720
and you will

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,759
land at the dusseldorf airport and

37
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,159
dusseldorf is the city where i live so

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,240
now because of board games you know

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,600
where i live

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,159
so when i was still studying uh

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,880
i think it's called computer sciences in

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
the u.s so when i was still studying

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,280
computer sciences

44
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,119
my professor asked our students if we

45
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,840
wanted to play a cyber security board

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,520
game

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,199
it was this one control alt hack and at

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,840
first i was really intrigued by that

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,000
because i like playing board games i

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,879
have an own a little board game club and

51
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,360
pre pandemic i think we played every two

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,640
weeks

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,440
and

54
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,080
there were there are um interesting

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,319
international people out there who were

56
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,720
new in dusseldorf i wanted to to get new

57
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,120
friends and also play board games

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,560
so when we uh so after we played

59
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,599
the control attack board game

60
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,200
uh white hack hacking for fun and profit

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,160
is the the under title

62
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,480
i was not so intrigued anymore because

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,200
objectively

64
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,519
i think this is a horrible cyber

65
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,440
security board game

66
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,160
so what i mean by objectively you see

67
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,760
are board games they have a theme

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,599
and they have certain mechanics

69
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,840
i will make an example so

70
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,280
nemesis

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
is a board game

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,080
about you being marines and scientists

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
uh being on a spaceship

74
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,000
and aliens invade your spaceship and

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,400
want to eat you alive

76
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,159
so the

77
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,920
theme of nemesis would be horror

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
and sci-fi

79
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,159
and the mechanics could involve

80
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,200
maybe

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,840
chucking dice or

82
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,720
playing a card or

83
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,360
uh having your your card or your card

84
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,000
deck built so deck building

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,560
so one of the mechanics one of the worst

86
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,879
mechanics i'd control altec uses is

87
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,080
known

88
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,480
for the name of take that

89
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,239
so take that would involve that i see a

90
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,640
fellow player for a human

91
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,439
right now are trying to win the game so

92
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,280
he's on the winning track or hers on the

93
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,319
winning track and i will play a

94
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,360
card

95
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,680
to sabotage

96
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,239
his moves or her moves

97
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,439
or maybe making a challenge

98
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,680
harder for this person so take that is a

99
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,880
sort of you know competition

100
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
over nine thousand

101
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,080
and i didn't really like that because i

102
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,199
think my work in cyber security

103
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,400
is really different

104
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,040
in the way of competition so the

105
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
question becomes is

106
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,199
what do i do

107
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,280
well you see

108
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,320
i would

109
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,840
uh have an idea or i will get a project

110
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,919
for my stakeholders

111
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,520
and i would start in the dark

112
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,360
i would know

113
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,960
very much about the topic or the project

114
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
or what is the end product i have to

115
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,400
deliver

116
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,960
and i will make a lot of mistakes

117
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,240
i will back myself into a corner

118
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,759
i would do

119
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,680
things inefficiently

120
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,560
or bad and making a lot of mistakes but

121
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,639
on the way as i iterate the project

122
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,000
as i iterate the idea and thinking more

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,560
about it looking at google and looking

124
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,360
at twitter and asking people and talking

125
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
to to to hundreds of different

126
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,320
um

127
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,720
to different colleagues or to to my

128
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,840
friends

129
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,759
i will get a better idea what i'm doing

130
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,360
to also

131
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,400
are

132
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,280
delivering a good project

133
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,160
so i will give you an example of that

134
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,720
let's say the board of directors

135
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,360
would ask would see the colonial

136
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,560
pipeline hack right and would ask

137
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,680
well

138
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,600
there is run somewhere out there we have

139
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,440
to do something but

140
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,639
how

141
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,560
do the gangs do it

142
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,280
and what are our current defenses

143
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,479
against it

144
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,840
so i would remember what i learned in

145
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
the university

146
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,160
and as me you will probably think about

147
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,960
some kind of cyber kill chain

148
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,000
so here i show you the the meter the the

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,039
mitre one cyber attack the life cycle

150
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,800
where uh

151
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
the this is from the perspective of the

152
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,520
adversary so the adversary would start

153
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,120
recording your

154
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,440
uh your company you know all the other

155
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,400
stuff

156
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,000
we saw in the topics before mine

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,880
they will find a vulnerability print

158
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,080
nightmare whatever they would exploit it

159
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,720
and then try to control the company and

160
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
run somewhere and so on and so on right

161
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,000
so this is not uh this this kind of

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,720
model is good uh to to talk to your

163
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,680
colleagues but it's not enough to ask to

164
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,400
to to answer questions for a board of

165
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,840
directives so i would go again searching

166
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,280
for what is the new the new model or

167
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,039
what is better model we can work

168
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,960
and it would be for example the metre

169
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,240
attack matrix which you see we had the

170
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,400
previous one was this kind of um

171
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,840
straightforward uh

172
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,080
life cycle right and here um you have

173
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,319
more options and the attackers could um

174
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,680
you know

175
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,720
go

176
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,360
in another direction and maybe um

177
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,000
look more into persistence than the

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,479
execution or the initial axis

179
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,879
so that's good but

180
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,440
as you see on the screenshots it's maybe

181
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,479
i don't know one tenth of the wall model

182
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,759
so that's too big to to tell someone so

183
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,680
i would search again and talk again and

184
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,800
say hey is there a kind of tool

185
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,319
where i could

186
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,680
uh

187
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,319
still get all the good things from me

188
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,319
attract

189
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,639
matrix but also

190
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,599
um have my organization and all my

191
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,520
defenses built in

192
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,759
and there is one so

193
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,039
there is a metre attack navigator

194
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,000
where i could select different platforms

195
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,840
so for example here in the screenshot i

196
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,879
selected the one for azure

197
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,958
active directory but you could also go

198
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,240
for sas or for network or for containers

199
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,360
maybe

200
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,360
and look uh how uh what are the attacks

201
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,799
on your docker and what are your

202
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,519
defenses and then you could play with

203
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,200
with with colors

204
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,600
so this is still a little bit nerdy for

205
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,000
a board of directives but with this

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,920
information i can now go to my to the to

207
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,560
the graphic people to to the graphic

208
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,080
people and ask them and set together

209
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,519
to make a visualization and make a story

210
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,160
and i don't mean to go to the marketing

211
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,000
department we have graphic people in our

212
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,320
i.t security department

213
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,720
so we would come up with something like

214
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,240
this and the the screenshot i'm showing

215
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,560
is from pentago which you assume is the

216
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,080
security vendor

217
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,760
so with this kind of visualization i can

218
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,279
tell a compelling story so i can start

219
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,160
with external reconning saying that

220
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,000
maybe the adversary is using lock for j

221
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,160
and is just going through our um through

222
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,519
our valve which is um

223
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,080
web application firewall which might be

224
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,519
something like here right and going from

225
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,440
it like butter

226
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,320
and then make the exploitation all the

227
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,040
asset discoveries looking for a backup

228
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,000
for our backups destroying that

229
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,720
uh encrypting the data

230
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,519
copying all the data to through his

231
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,120
command and conquer

232
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,160
conquer command and secure servers

233
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,800
and then exfiltrating the data not only

234
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,200
of our employees but also for our

235
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
customer and then you know what will

236
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,399
happen double extortion right

237
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,079
so this is the kind of information we

238
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,120
seek

239
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,680
and the most interesting thing is if

240
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,839
you're maybe not studying right now

241
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,720
cyber security but you studied for

242
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,760
example or you right now still studying

243
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,399
psychology or you are into

244
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,680
uh graphic design or game design

245
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,079
we want to employ you and we want you on

246
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,880
your team right now because the better

247
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,120
story we can tell

248
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,760
the larger the budget we will get but

249
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,040
also as you've seen on my improvement

250
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,000
chart

251
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,200
we have to iterate so we need different

252
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,720
perspectives

253
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,600
to do a good job right

254
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,839
so the board of directives might now

255
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,920
see all the story and say okay we

256
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,880
understand a little bit how ransomware

257
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,600
how ransomware how ransomware gangs work

258
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
and now we know what are our current

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,120
defenses so i.t security team

260
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,880
what are you going to do with this

261
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,519
information that you presented to us

262
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,040
what are our what are going what

263
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,760
are our defenses are going to be in the

264
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,959
future

265
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,920
so i will iterate again

266
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,880
on the project go to the drawing board

267
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,720
speak to a lot of people

268
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,640
and then find out that mitre has also

269
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,760
have has you covered with metre defend

270
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,000
which is right now in beta but as you

271
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,399
can see there are topics like hartner

272
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,399
harden detect isolate and even deceive

273
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,320
and we had this eve

274
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,000
today

275
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,320
on in the pancake store which was a

276
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,839
great talk

277
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,760
so if you see all the other improving uh

278
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,279
part of the thing is really important

279
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,240
so

280
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,279
um

281
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,440
and the kind of

282
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,560
the kind of improving i told you on a

283
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,519
project level or on the on the on the

284
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,360
level of my mind

285
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,320
is also a large topic in

286
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,480
cyber security management

287
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,800
uh which is baked into iso 27.1 and

288
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,120
called a pdci cycle where you plan do

289
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,560
check and act and you do that a lot and

290
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,480
you will improve and iterate on your

291
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,600
project

292
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
now

293
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,839
as i say to you at the start i'm

294
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,040
sometimes in the dark and maybe

295
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,240
sometimes i good at visualizing and

296
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,000
presenting and doing all the the

297
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,399
management and

298
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,959
knowing the words i have to tell someone

299
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,839
to to get other things like a little bit

300
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,519
business social engineering let's call

301
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,720
it like that

302
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,680
but

303
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,920
am i really

304
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,639
getting the security of my company up

305
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,839
against ransomware and other

306
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,480
threats sometimes i don't really know

307
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,920
so that's why the check part is really

308
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,399
important so let's let's drill into the

309
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,920
check part

310
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
you see for the check part

311
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,480
there is a model called the three lines

312
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,959
of defense with the first second and

313
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,560
third line

314
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,680
uh

315
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
and you will probably start in the first

316
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,800
line but let's let's start with the with

317
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,240
with a with a

318
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,680
explanation at the governing body level

319
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,600
so the government body

320
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,720
might be

321
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,240
managers

322
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,160
they might be senior management they

323
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,079
might be ceos or the board of directors

324
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,360
on the right you would see the external

325
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,440
assurance providers

326
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
which would mean for in germany for

327
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
example this could also be uh the

328
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,880
the state agency for example the data

329
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,439
protection

330
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,040
authorities

331
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,399
who would check on us if we fulfill the

332
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,519
data protection loss which is an erop

333
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,639
gdpr as you know because of all the

334
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,560
horrible cookies you have to click away

335
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,519
so let's get back to the first second

336
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,120
and third lines so the first line would

337
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,000
be

338
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,839
the um

339
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,279
service desk

340
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,160
it could be people from soccer or if you

341
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,399
don't have a sock it could be your

342
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,240
security operation are guys and girls

343
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,720
it could be the purchasing department

344
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,360
because someone needs to get all the

345
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,760
contract stuff right

346
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,800
but also and the most important role are

347
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,000
the cyber witches who administer

348
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,199
your

349
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,000
linux servers right so this would be the

350
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,320
people in the first line

351
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,040
people normally who would have the first

352
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,000
level and sec second level support jobs

353
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,360
now the second line this is me the the

354
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,240
the it risk man the it risk management

355
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,720
department the i.t security management

356
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
it would be the lawyers from uh

357
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,040
corporate from compliance the compliance

358
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,680
department and it would be

359
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,440
the team

360
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,240
uh

361
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,480
from um the data protection officer who

362
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,720
is a really important part of any

363
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,360
organization in germany

364
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,480
and also there would be a third line

365
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,519
who would

366
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,360
try to check on us what we are doing and

367
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,800
we would check on the first line and try

368
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,759
to improve in this way

369
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,360
an organization

370
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
so i would like to give you an example

371
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,079
how many meetings i sometimes have so we

372
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,199
were trying to get a contract with uh

373
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,000
with american security company

374
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,199
and i was um so my job was involving i

375
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,079
was involved in checking the um

376
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,720
technical measures of a certain product

377
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,000
which means which involves a lot of uh

378
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,079
contract and involved of

379
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,199
um

380
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,480
reading and understanding the the law

381
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,320
part of the contract but the technical

382
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,959
part of the contract so i would so for

383
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,600
this one contract i was with the data

384
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,480
protection officers i probably met

385
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,600
around

386
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,399
10 to 12 times alone

387
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,839
which might sound inefficient right

388
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,000
but i need that

389
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,800
and that's because there is a so-called

390
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,600
swiss cheese model so you know the

391
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,240
swiss cheese the one with the holes

392
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,880
you see if you have an adversary who for

393
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,919
example wants to ransomware your company

394
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,319
he has to find

395
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,760
holes

396
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,319
in every

397
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,760
in every of controls of your

398
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,439
measures

399
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,919
so you might think of the first level as

400
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,119
firewall

401
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,679
the second level as windows defender

402
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,559
scm and so on and so on but every

403
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,880
security measure you are using has holes

404
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,520
and i think in the future we'll here

405
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,679
talk about uh defense in depth

406
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,919
from a technical perspective

407
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,720
on the swiss cheese model but i think

408
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,200
the most important part in the swiss

409
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,559
cheese model is not the technical part

410
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,320
it's the other parts

411
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,160
so if you would

412
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,760
look at these charts

413
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,080
seeing the first one as

414
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,160
technical measures

415
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,000
and the second part as organizational

416
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,120
message and the third part as human

417
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,080
as individual measures so maybe

418
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,080
you see that a lot of attacks

419
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,120
are from phishing emails

420
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,760
you will want to talk to

421
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,400
up the physiology people right and

422
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,120
figure out if you need a phishing

423
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,160
simulation solution and figure out

424
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,559
in which way a phishing simulation

425
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,440
solution will really help you instead

426
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,160
just fulfilling some kind of

427
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,039
copies right

428
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,360
so the important part of that

429
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,640
is that i need other people to work with

430
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,880
me and to talk to them and to have

431
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,440
meetings with them and that's because

432
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,240
probably i'm going to be good at only

433
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,720
one of the things maybe i'm good at

434
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,320
organization

435
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,559
on the organization part of the i.t

436
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,039
security because i'm good at

437
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,280
uh i don't know

438
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,080
bureaucracy

439
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,400
and the wall the wall talking thing and

440
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,440
moderating but i'm not so good at the

441
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,679
technical part or at the contractual

442
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,160
part of the law part or at the human

443
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,679
part

444
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,919
so as you see this kind of pdci cycle

445
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,320
from easel

446
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,039
27001

447
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,000
the

448
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,240
three lines of defense and the swiss

449
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
cheese model

450
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,000
they are working together

451
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and as a result i can strongly improve

452
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,440
myself

453
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,880
my team

454
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,320
and the project

455
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,000
following

456
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,600
these models

457
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,880
meaning so so that one of the important

458
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,640
things in cyber security

459
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,480
is not competition but cooperation

460
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,080
so my suggestion my first suggestion for

461
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,159
a better cyber security board game

462
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,679
would be cooperation as the main board

463
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,919
game mechanic

464
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,280
so

465
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,480
this was my first part of the talk

466
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,039
and we are going to the vampires part of

467
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,080
the talk to the second part of the talk

468
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,039
but we are not going to leave swiss

469
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,679
cheese behind right now we're going to

470
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,640
start with a talk on critical i.t

471
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,440
infrastructure in germany you say you

472
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,120
you see critical infrastructure in

473
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,400
germany

474
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
well where do i begin

475
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,640
let's say it's full of holes and

476
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,400
sometimes

477
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,840
the wall the wall in it infrastructure

478
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,080
is just a large hole

479
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,120
and

480
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,039
if that is the case

481
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,240
there's sometimes only the hole

482
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,200
and it's all together probably by tape

483
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,559
or duct tape

484
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,159
i will give you a personal a very

485
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,799
personal example so in september 2020

486
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,440
the largest hospital in dusseldorf was

487
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,840
successfully ransomwared by a gang

488
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,799
and we think that they made

489
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,840
a mistake with google translate or some

490
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,760
other translator so means there were um

491
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
foreign adversaries

492
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,400
because they thought they they are

493
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,799
attacking the university you see the

494
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,960
name if you translate it with some kind

495
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,840
of translation to would be university

496
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,640
hospital dusseldorf so we thought that

497
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,559
this is university

498
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,440
which which the doctors and the nurses

499
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,480
study but it was the hospital

500
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,880
near the university because it's a this

501
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,240
large building

502
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,640
or this large building complex let's

503
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,080
take like that

504
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,559
so when the gang

505
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,799
saw their mistake

506
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,440
they uh they they talked with the german

507
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,159
police and gave the german police the

508
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,720
decryption keys are for the for their

509
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,520
ransomware but it was already too late

510
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,480
so the uh the so the hospital

511
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,840
had to rebuild large parts

512
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,600
of its i.t infrastructure

513
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,120
and you see

514
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,960
if your id is ransomware if your id is

515
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,919
down

516
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,520
you don't have you

517
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,159
neither have an i.t and you neither has

518
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,039
to have a hospital which is horrible

519
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,640
because it was september 2020 we had

520
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,799
covet and i mean we still have we have

521
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,280
omicron in germany right but at that

522
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,960
time me and most of my

523
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,520
family members were not not

524
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
fully vaccinated

525
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,480
so

526
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,880
i think it was the first time in years

527
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,320
that i really felt horrified because of

528
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,280
that

529
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,520
and this could happen again

530
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,080
with most of the german critical

531
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,440
infrastructure and you know the same

532
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,799
might happen

533
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,039
with u.s infrastructure and other

534
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,360
infrastructures in the world

535
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,919
so now to something a little less

536
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:16,320
horrifying that the real threat of

537
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,559
ransomware we will come

538
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,640
to the second part of the talk

539
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,760
which is

540
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
horror movies

541
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,039
or horror movie tropes so you see we

542
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,960
will start 100 years from now in 1922

543
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,559
with a movie called nosferatu and i

544
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,600
think it's about a really thirsty person

545
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,439
so allow myself to get water

546
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,520
thank you

547
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,919
so the next one is uh

548
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,799
the mummy where

549
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,640
an actor carlos

550
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,400
comes to life in 1932

551
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,279
and

552
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,400
in 1933

553
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
king kong

554
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,600
which was for a

555
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,400
1933 movie a kind of scary and horrory

556
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,440
right

557
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,000
and horrible

558
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,880
uh

559
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,480
which established and make made some

560
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,000
made a big influence of some of the tv

561
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,039
tropes

562
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,080
which are scream queen

563
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,840
but also um

564
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,360
the the damsel in distress

565
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,880
trope which is from king kong

566
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,000
so in 1935

567
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,720
karloff being carlos

568
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,039
have invented the trope

569
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,400
of a slow-moving zombie in the bride of

570
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,279
frankenstein

571
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,760
in

572
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,440
1947 which was

573
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,559
after the war and it was hard to find a

574
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,799
horror movie i took the freedom to

575
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,720
show you dr jekyll and mr mouse which is

576
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,640
probably a funny cartoon for children

577
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,799
in 1960 a movie not for children is

578
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,080
psycho from hitchcock and i must say

579
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,760
hitchcock has aspired a lot of really

580
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,480
good horror movie posters

581
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,760
the next one is my favorite

582
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,039
you see

583
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,360
this amazing art is 90 percent

584
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,720
topography

585
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,279
it's the font right it's

586
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,200
probably just the font

587
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,240
and it's called taki which i assume is

588
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,080
polish for

589
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,760
the birds

590
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,039
i mean this is amazing

591
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,000
art right you don't need to see the

592
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,360
movie

593
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,159
to

594
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,080
have fear from this post

595
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,799
i'm i'm really amazed at that

596
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,840
so

597
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,600
the next one from 1968

598
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,880
uh was a controversy in the usa because

599
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,159
the hero was elsa black man

600
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,679
in night

601
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,679
of the living dead

602
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,679
and i have to to tell you a little um

603
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,760
a little joke

604
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,039
or a little anecdote because

605
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,200
this movie was the hardest one to get

606
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,200
a pg-14 poster i think i looked for

607
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,480
through 40 different posters from night

608
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,320
of the living dead and i think this was

609
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,720
the only pg-14-ish

610
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,320
one

611
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,600
and i think it's amazing and also have

612
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,000
the hero of the story

613
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,600
so in 1974

614
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,080
we have blood for dracula and i

615
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
especially

616
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,400
took the japanese poster

617
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,919
because

618
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,000
it has a lot of japanese culture backed

619
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,799
in

620
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,039
you see in japan

621
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,159
um when you look at the mimic of the

622
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,480
face the eyes are really and a really

623
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,679
important part so as you can see here

624
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,760
he's

625
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,919
so intensively

626
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,600
but also

627
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,840
this andy warhol

628
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,000
design has four pictures of him and four

629
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
pictures of her

630
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,720
such a lovely symmetry probably it's a

631
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,880
movie about love

632
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,760
well we have again nosteratu

633
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,039
and i'm showing the the german

634
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,399
version phantom der nacht

635
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,520
so

636
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,880
if you can

637
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,520
pause on youtube you can go back and

638
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,720
look at both of nosferatus

639
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,000
because we started it in 1922

640
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,279
right

641
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,159
and then and i already showed you

642
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,679
nemesis

643
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,600
um this is a movie from 1986

644
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,720
called aliens so nemesis the the board

645
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,120
game nemesis and aliens are like

646
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,480
the big sister and the little sister so

647
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,919
the next one

648
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,279
would be

649
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,640
for you

650
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,000
uh dear moderator it would be

651
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,279
ringu

652
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,000
which is the japanese version of the

653
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,640
ring and i'm showing you the uh japanese

654
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,520
version of that not the not the american

655
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,440
one so now let's switch to board games

656
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,679
so in 2005 we have arkham horror which

657
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,000
has an interesting motto so it's it says

658
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,880
the classic game of lovecraftian

659
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,279
adventure so you see it's only just

660
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,840
horror just a bit of horror maybe a

661
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,720
little bit of splitter but it's mostly

662
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,559
an adventure

663
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,480
you can live with

664
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,120
up to eight players ages 12 to adult

665
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,320
also uh in 2014 was a cooperative game

666
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,440
that of winter it's obviously about

667
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,880
zombies

668
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,279
so in this game there is uh there is a

669
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,399
certain interesting mechanic

670
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,120
of someone who might betray the group

671
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,279
so in this game he will search for the

672
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,960
for the police station for search for

673
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,200
the weapons search for medicine and so

674
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,399
on and so on but some players might have

675
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,320
goals which

676
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,520
do not

677
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,640
uh help the group and the fun thing when

678
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,360
you

679
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,000
playing the game you don't know if you

680
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,520
will not know

681
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,520
if you have a traitor or not and he

682
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,120
might reveal himself at the start but he

683
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,360
might not so this has this kind of

684
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,159
social deduction and specs

685
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,640
are baked into the game and also a lot

686
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,520
of

687
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,679
throwing dice

688
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,200
so the next one is elsa horror movie

689
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,399
trope

690
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,640
and its final girl from 2021

691
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,679
so the very interesting thing about

692
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,159
final girl because i'd say to you

693
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,880
remember the arkham horror play up to

694
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,799
from play up to eight players this one

695
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,399
is intended for a solo experience

696
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,120
meaning you don't need friends

697
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,919
you can play this horror movie alone

698
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,080
like final girl

699
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,279
cool but i think my favorite

700
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,360
board game i need to get in germany and

701
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,559
sadly because of the logistics crisis

702
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,480
it's not yet here

703
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,720
is horrified american monsters so when

704
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,480
uh on monday

705
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,000
the your next target is going to open

706
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,960
go there buy this game and have a lot of

707
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,279
fun with your family and your friends

708
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,760
and i'm really intrigued about that

709
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,399
about this game because

710
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,440
in our rope we don't have such monsters

711
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,320
i never heard of chewbacca or mothman

712
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,399
so i'm really intrigued to playing this

713
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,600
game and learning a lot more about

714
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,080
american monsters

715
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,679
so now

716
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,480
as you've seen so what i did i

717
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,440
gave i i wanted to to give you a certain

718
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,320
mood we will come to the conclusion to

719
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,559
the last board game i want to introduce

720
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,399
because we're interested in making

721
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,960
better cyber security board games

722
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,720
and the game is called neutrophobia and

723
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,120
nukto stands latin for the knights

724
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,480
so

725
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,279
nuketophobia is a really unique and

726
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,240
interesting game in a way that you will

727
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,440
play up to four players and one of them

728
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,279
is a game master

729
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,720
slash murderer pun intended

730
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,200
and the other one would be the other up

731
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,440
to three players would be the victims

732
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,120
and they are playing

733
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
teenagers

734
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,039
so the three teenagers up to three

735
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,799
teenagers would

736
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,000
wake up

737
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,640
in a dark forest

738
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,519
and this is how the game looks

739
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,480
they would have to find an abandoned

740
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,000
police car

741
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,360
to get to the radio and to call the

742
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,399
police for help that's their goal and

743
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,279
they have to cooperate with each other

744
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,840
finding the car somewhere on this on

745
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,600
this little board

746
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,880
and the murderer is obviously trying to

747
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,360
butcher some of the players and he if he

748
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,799
succeeds

749
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,440
he will win the game

750
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,720
now

751
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,600
on the outside this game might look a

752
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,679
little boring and colorless but on the

753
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,559
inside it's beautiful and functional

754
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,679
because as the victims

755
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,000
you will not

756
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,600
see the board you have to feel the board

757
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,960
and that's because you're playing blind

758
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,720
you know you will you will you will have

759
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,960
this kind of sunglasses

760
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,440
and you will not see anything

761
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,720
so the game master which also murderer

762
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,159
um will try to help you feel the board

763
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,000
and you will start somewhere and you

764
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,519
will kill the board and you will you

765
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,240
will

766
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,039
tell your other players that you

767
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,000
thinking that looking so feeling this

768
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,480
kind of board you think that you you are

769
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,000
in the self direction on the board

770
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,279
and you see uh this this feels like a

771
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,279
dead end so

772
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,799
you now

773
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,840
think about going to the north or going

774
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,200
to the to the east part right

775
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,679
and then other players would suggest to

776
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,679
you what to do

777
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,559
so i find that really intriguing and

778
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,000
interesting

779
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,800
and that's because this is a perfect

780
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,399
metaphor for cyber security you see in

781
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,839
cyber security you have an adversary

782
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,239
maybe it's someone from china you don't

783
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,800
know and you don't care

784
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,480
because the king of the ransom again

785
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,560
is not going to kill you personally but

786
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,399
it's going to have

787
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,918
a huge attack on the reputation of your

788
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,159
company it's going to copy and run

789
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,599
somewhere your customers data and

790
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,719
the data of your colleagues and of all

791
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,960
the other employees

792
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,040
and on the other hand you have tools

793
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,119
like zm which are

794
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,639
probably a

795
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,199
needle in a hoist situation

796
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,920
so you're kind of looming in the dark

797
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,640
trying to defend against someone you

798
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,200
don't know

799
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,280
so

800
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,119
i think

801
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,760
this can be turned

802
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,359
easily

803
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,000
i mean easily on a conceptual level into

804
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,720
a cyber security board game and bonus

805
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,560
parts of this game are 3d printed

806
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,760
meaning

807
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,560
that

808
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,000
you could modify it with a little 3d

809
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,079
print skills so i think in the next five

810
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,480
years i need to learn how to 3d print

811
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,000
my own game called probably i don't know

812
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,400
maybe something like

813
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,940
um

814
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,400
[Music]

815
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,839
ransom phobia or something like that

816
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,040
so

817
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,680
making a conclusion

818
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,839
my suggestion would be the second

819
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,480
suggestion would be for for

820
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,960
making a better cyber security board

821
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,680
game to include being in the dark

822
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,720
as

823
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,359
a board game mechanic

824
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,078
starting with neutrophobia

825
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,320
so

826
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,119
thank you for being here hearing my talk

827
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,839
and now i await pancakes

828
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,000
and questions

829
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,160
yes so the first question i see in chat

830
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,680
is they're wondering you mentioned that

831
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,480
there's a graphic designer in in your

832
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,640
cyber security team or in cyber security

833
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,320
teams in general and they're very

834
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,079
curious about what that person does and

835
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,839
what their role is

836
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,359
yes so we have

837
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,560
we have two so we are a team of around

838
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,359
10 to 11 people and we have working

839
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,920
students so one of a working student a

840
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,960
student

841
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,720
um learned uh web design and graphic

842
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,599
design for 15 years and then he wanted

843
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,800
to switch places so he switched from uh

844
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,440
more of the marketing and graphic design

845
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,839
position right now to i.t security

846
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,040
and uh to computer sciences

847
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,200
so what he does is you see uh uh we have

848
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,880
to make a lot of guidelines for certain

849
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,760
things uh the guidelines for example for

850
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,720
business continuity management which is

851
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,560
a wall of text

852
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,960
and i mean it's easy to make some kind

853
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,200
of

854
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,520
icons to tell how things would go uh if

855
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,520
if horrible things happen in your

856
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,359
company and then we'll have to do

857
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,520
business continuity management but what

858
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,760
he does is reading through all the

859
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,400
documents and trying

860
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,320
to visualize

861
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,760
the document into a one-pager

862
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,960
and that's an important task

863
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,520
because most of the people are not going

864
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,480
to read your document right

865
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,599
they are they want to to understand the

866
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,440
whole thing in under five minutes

867
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,720
so next question

868
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,480
let's see if anybody else has questions

869
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,320
does anybody else have a question for

870
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,240
max

871
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,760
i can also they're just talking about

872
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,200
their they're talking about their

873
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,800
favorite board games and their favorite

874
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,880
yeah

875
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,599
in in chat i already asked someone about

876
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,720
his favorite tabletop game which is

877
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,880
near both games right

878
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,240
and i think

879
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,520
people maybe uh remember dungeon drinks

880
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
and they come at that right and maybe

881
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,280
remember some dungeons and dragons um

882
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,960
some dungeon dragons are games used in a

883
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,160
certain really cool series

884
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,839
of an american

885
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:42,640
uh

886
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,720
horror

887
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,400
if you know the the syrians i mean

888
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,480
with the kind of espa

889
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,680
a girl

890
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,839
playing in old uh us

891
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
i see some shout outs for betrayal at

892
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,359
the house on the hill yes

893
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,240
i see

894
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,200
shout outs for a zombie side um yes on

895
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,460
this side yeah like that

896
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,240
[Music]

897
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,880
oh gosh

898
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
they're all debating about the genre of

899
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,800
aliens too they're all they're all

900
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,960
debating about the the genres of alien

901
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,040
and aliens and in my opinion they're

902
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,359
both the two movies are different genres

903
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,480
but that you might disagree there

904
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,960
yeah well you see uh this is a cultural

905
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,079
thing because in in other cultures maybe

906
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,880
horrible things are you know recycled

907
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,440
differently right

908
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,160
maybe for for a german person

909
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,720
having having no toilet paper

910
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,520
crazy things so you might make a horror

911
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,160
movie about that and also

912
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,599
movies change and i think our keynote

913
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,560
talked a lot about racism and about

914
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,680
norms

915
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,760
so something which was scary in 1920

916
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,800
it's laughable right now

917
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,920
and

918
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,920
on the other side right

919
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,040
and then of course there's the

920
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,040
obligatory shout out to back doors and

921
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,079
breaches the cyber security tabletop

922
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,839

923
