security champions today

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,079
and urban gardening so i'm super into

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,239
gardening or even farming at this point

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,480
and but let me tell you more about what

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,879
we're gonna talk about so we're gonna

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,800
talk about how to scale your security

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,280
team and your security program via

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,800
security champions and we're gonna talk

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,480
about what they are

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,800
and how you can build them up from like

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,000
a regular

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,159
employee to a person that advocates for

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,320
security all the time

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,080
and we're going to talk about how and

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,760
why you

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,680
need to grow your own food

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,080
okay so but first security champions so

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,320
we are going to follow this recipe

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,840
the recipe is

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,880
recruit

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,240
engage

40
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,680
teach

41
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,840
recognize and reward them and do not

42
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,439
stop okay so i'm done i can go home just

43
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,680
kidding there's more okay so who am i so

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,520
i'm tanya and i am a giant nerd on the

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,240
internet and we do these slides to try

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,880
to tell you that we are qualified to

47
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,880
give our own talk so hopefully you're

48
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,960
like she seems pretty good we'll watch

49
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
the rest of this she probably has good

50
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
photos of like things she grew and yes

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,479
it's true there's gonna be flowers and

52
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,200
yummy food so stick with me okay so the

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,399
problem

54
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,040
there's not enough just security

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,560
professionals in general and i

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,719
specialize in the security of software

57
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,119
so application security

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,759
and like this you all know this problem

59
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,520
i don't need to detail it we just don't

60
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
have enough people who are qualified and

61
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,840
experienced to do every job

62
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,840
and so one of the solutions for this is

63
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,360
security champion so i'm going to give

64
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
you a super formal definition then i'm

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,720
going to give you the tanya plain

66
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,319
language definition so super formal

67
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,319
the security champion is a member of a

68
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,120
team

69
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,360
that takes on the responsibility of

70
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,040
acting as the primary advocate for

71
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,080
security within the team and acting as a

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,840
first line of defense

73
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,319
for security issues within that team so

74
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,560
that sounds almost like a daunting task

75
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,239
well i like to think of security

76
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,680
champions as

77
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,519
the person who's super excited about

78
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,760
security they're curious they're the

79
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,120
most interested they're the ones that

80
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,640
ask the questions they're the ones that

81
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,519
read the book or show up at the ctf or

82
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,920
show up at the local conference or the

83
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,000
local meetup they're the ones who are

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
there every time who always want to know

85
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
more that is your person that you want

86
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,959
to turn into a champion

87
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,239
so

88
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,319
what is a champion like really like what

89
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,599
do they do

90
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,720
so first of all they're your

91
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,239
communicator

92
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,480
so this person will deliver security

93
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,920
messages

94
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,400
from so in my case they'll deliver

95
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,120
messages to the dev team teaching

96
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
sharing and helping but this could be

97
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,800
like privacy messages and security

98
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,720
messages to the sales team or to the

99
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
marketing team or to like the people

100
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,120
that drive around and deliver stuff

101
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,640
security is part of every single

102
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,280
person's job and giving them information

103
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,840
about how to do their jobs more securely

104
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,400
is always good and so this person's also

105
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
your point of contact so they will

106
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,959
deliver messages back to the security

107
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,560
team and kind of keep you up to date and

108
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
tell you what's going on they'll often

109
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,159
alert you to things that are actually

110
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,599
really serious

111
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,200
way before your tools would have picked

112
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,000
it up if you have a good relationship

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,080
this person is your advocate and by your

114
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,000
advocate i mean the advocate of the

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,319
security team and if you mix security

116
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,159
and privacy which a lot of companies do

117
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,599
when they do a security champions

118
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,519
program that means they'll be your

119
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,000
advocate for privacy as well and so they

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
perform security work

121
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,599
for their own team

122
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,120
but with your help

123
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,720
and they advocate for security and so

124
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,480
imagine if someone on your team next to

125
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,639
you says hey we're probably not supposed

126
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,639
to do that remember

127
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,478
it's a lot different than if tonya the

128
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,079
big bad security person comes to your

129
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,840
desk and they're like nah nah nah hand

130
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
slap it's just not the same as if your

131
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,240
peer does a person that's on your team

132
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,800
versus someone else from a far away land

133
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
called security team

134
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,440
so let's build up our security champions

135
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,160
so you don't just find them right

136
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,280
you

137
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,199
recruit them you engage them you teach

138
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,759
them recognize you reward and you

139
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,400
continue to do so don't stop

140
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
um that is the key part of this recipe

141
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,080
so we're going to go through this recipe

142
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
pretty quickly because i want to talk to

143
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,360
you about gardening too so first recruit

144
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
um i like the big muscle

145
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,360
so the first rule in recruiting is you

146
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,680
don't volunteer people you're not like

147
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,600
you're late to the meeting haha you're a

148
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
security champion now

149
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
instead you want to attract the right

150
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,360
people and so we're going to talk about

151
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
attracting people and the number two

152
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,680
most important rule is ensure that the

153
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,759
manager is on board because if you

154
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,440
recruit someone as a security champion

155
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,639
and then their manager is like what are

156
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,320
you doing stop wasting so much time with

157
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,360
that then the person is forced to choose

158
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,080
between doing security what you want and

159
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,680
what their boss wants and that person

160
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,160
decides if they have a job or not that's

161
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
not a cool place to put someone so you

162
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
want managers on board

163
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,759
how do we recruit

164
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,199
people

165
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,600
so we ask for volunteers instead of

166
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
appointing people because consent is

167
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,479
cool

168
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,479
we provide opportunities for them to

169
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,880
reveal themselves so all the things in

170
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,440
the engagement section which is next

171
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,759
is an opportunity to reveal themselves

172
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,440
it sounds silly but you can add to your

173
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
email signature that you're looking i

174
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,199
add things all the time to my email

175
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,360
signature and i get so many different

176
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,120
responses so like i'm looking for

177
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,800
security champions

178
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,319
is this you

179
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,240
my friend lucas did it and he had four

180
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,840
people respond and two of them became

181
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,680
champions all just from like two seconds

182
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,160
changing his email signature

183
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,479
so to attract them or recruit them you

184
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,080
could use lunch and learns you could

185
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,319
have security trainings you could anyone

186
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,080
that asks a lot of questions or always

187
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,479
shows up that person's probably ripe to

188
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,520
be

189
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,680
a security champion

190
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,120
and

191
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,680
if you adopt this mantra of it's my job

192
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,880
as a security team to enable you

193
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,360
to do your job securely

194
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,919
i serve you when we have an attitude

195
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,080
like that we're more likely

196
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,840
you know you get more honey you get more

197
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,080
bees with honey than you do with vinegar

198
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,960
when we start the conversation from that

199
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,240
place it is way easier to recruit so at

200
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,599
this point you should have like a

201
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,680
handful of people that are interested

202
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,840
then we go on to engagement

203
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,759
and then they'll tell other people

204
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,919
and then you will recruit more people

205
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,479
talk and if you do this right everything

206
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,639
they say is going to be good so we want

207
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,720
to engage our champions what does engage

208
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
me

209
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,800
occupy attract or involve

210
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,160
so i want to

211
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,120
occupy and attract and involve them

212
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,120
in the security of our organization and

213
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,880
the security activities that their team

214
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,479
needs to do

215
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,639
and i also want to participate or become

216
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,560
involved with them

217
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,960
they are my champs i am their fearless

218
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,199
leader the security team is feeding them

219
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,599
enabling them and propping them up to be

220
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,960
awesome and so we're in it together

221
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,720
so for engaging

222
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,120
bring them on a security incident

223
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,680
share appropriate secrets with them

224
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,199
i went somewhere once and my boss

225
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,199
deputized everyone and made them promise

226
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,639
not to tell and then he spilled all

227
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,800
these secrets and it got a lot of people

228
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,319
really riled up and on our side

229
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,080
let them see everything first like new

230
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,199
tools

231
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,039
new policies new information like

232
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,560
anything always they always get the

233
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,840
sneak peek

234
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,680
create a mailing list and send them cool

235
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,039
new stuff

236
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,280
meet with them once every single month

237
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,199
each one of them and have a list of

238
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,039
questions like what are you working on

239
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,400
can i help you what do you need

240
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,319
brace yourself for bad news because once

241
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,240
they start to trust you they're going to

242
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,800
tell you things and this is mostly a

243
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,120
message for past tanya who wears her

244
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,360
feelings on her face i

245
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,479
i can i'm really bad lying and i'll just

246
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,000
be like

247
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,400
um so brace yourself because eventually

248
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,000
they'll trust you and they will tell you

249
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,120
secrets

250
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,399
and you need to

251
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,320
hold their trust and go do the thing

252
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,080
that they need from you

253
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,919
team building events let them meet each

254
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,320
other and even invite them to join local

255
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,000
security communities so for instance

256
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
anywhere you work invite everyone to

257
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,720
come pancakes con this is a free event

258
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,920
where they could learn lots of cool

259
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,399
stuff or just pick out one talk that you

260
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,480
think really would benefit people from

261
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,680
your team and be like come at you know

262
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,600
noon because kanye's going to talk about

263
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,959
security champions and we're starting

264
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,399
security champion program and i think

265
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,959
it'd be really good for you to see

266
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,839
so then you want to teach them and i

267
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,839
could go on and on forever and ever so

268
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,440
i've tried to cut this so it's a lot

269
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,880
shorter i used to be like

270
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,240
okay so what are you gonna teach your

271
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,040
champs the most important thing about

272
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,560
this is only what they need oh nothing

273
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,800
more i have seen so many security

274
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
champion programs where they have these

275
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,600
software developers and they're teaching

276
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,399
them

277
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,200
tons of like network hacking and like

278
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,440
all this cool ocean stuff and they're

279
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,279
like let's show them meta fleet i'm like

280
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,959
we don't want them to do any of that at

281
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,120
work why are you showing them that why

282
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,959
don't you instead give them secure

283
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,600
coding training and secure design and

284
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,959
all the things that they do at work so

285
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,680
that they can be rock stars at securing

286
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,200
the applications they build like they're

287
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,720
the person with all the answers and they

288
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,800
look really awesome teaching them tons

289
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,959
of things are off topic and they have an

290
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,279
entire job to do that they have to be an

291
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,279
expert at already

292
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,120
waste their time

293
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
the other thing that's really important

294
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,880
to teach them is what you need

295
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,600
expect and want from them it needs to be

296
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,399
super clear from day one what you expect

297
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,000
because sometimes people are like well i

298
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,600
made them champions and then they should

299
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,560
know

300
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,920
that they should tell me if they see

301
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
something they should know no can't

302
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,079
assume that they read your minds

303
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,160
turns out most of us actually can't read

304
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,880
minds i can't i try i fail and so

305
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,560
we have to tell them exactly what we

306
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,800
want so let's say

307
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,880
i want you to take the results from the

308
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,120
scanner when they come in on monday and

309
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
i want you to go over them with your

310
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,160
team by you know thursday and then you

311
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,079
know send which ones you're going to fix

312
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,519
in this release and which ones are going

313
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,720
in the backlog

314
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
or i want you to come to me if there's

315
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
ever a security question you can't

316
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,480
answer and you still need help i'm here

317
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,720
for you i'm your person

318
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,000
okay topics so if you have devs secure

319
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,640
coding if you have software architects

320
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,760
secure design and secure architecture

321
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,279
no matter what you teach them their

322
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,480
policies

323
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,720
do not send them a link to a policy

324
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,560
that's 25 pages long and be like yeah

325
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,640
read this teach yourself no that's a

326
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,480
recipe for disaster you want to have

327
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,240
like a workshop about it or you talk

328
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,000
about and discuss the things and how

329
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,839
they would apply it because then they're

330
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,120
going to have to go

331
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
and teach it

332
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,560
and reinforce it on their teams so they

333
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,640
need to know it inside and out

334
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,279
and tooling any tool that's security

335
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,200
related that you expect them to use give

336
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,519
them training any training you made i

337
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,120
usually just make the training myself

338
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,880
and i know you're like oh she gives

339
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,399
training for a living so she's really

340
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,360
good at that but i i sucked at the

341
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,079
beginnings be clear i was very fearful

342
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,160
of speaking in front of other humans and

343
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,640
it is worn off over time and also they

344
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,440
were really nice to me

345
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,200
okay so the next thing we want to do is

346
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,639
we want to reward

347
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,360
and recognize them and so

348
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,120
this might seem a bit confusing and you

349
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,639
might be thinking like reward and

350
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,320
recognize aren't those the same thing

351
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,040
okay

352
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
i am the type of person

353
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,560
don't tell don't tell the people it pay

354
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,079
me but being recognized makes me feel

355
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,959
so good if my boss says banyan you did a

356
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,959
great job it's like i melt inside i'm so

357
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,160
happy

358
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,480
i could probably paid less but if i have

359
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,800
lots of praise i'd be so happy and it's

360
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,760
okay

361
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,839
versus some people they're like that

362
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,519
praise is nice but those are just words

363
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,360
if i really meant something to you you

364
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
would reward me you would give me

365
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,639
something of monetary value it shows

366
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,600
like legitimately that you actually that

367
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,360
this praise means something

368
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,760
and so a lot of people fit into one vote

369
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,000
or the other like love languages so if

370
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
you know about the love languages

371
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,560
there's five love languages but the

372
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,399
other three are wicked inappropriate at

373
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,079
work touching

374
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,360
nope

375
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,120
so those are the two that were totally

376
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,519
okay to do at work is recognizing

377
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,200
awesome things that the people doing

378
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,440
giving them work appropriate compliments

379
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
and rewarding them with work appropriate

380
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,040
gifts so

381
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,160
and

382
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,560
it's really important to do both

383
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,320
because if you just do one you're kind

384
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,440
of letting a whole bunch of people go

385
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,760
so let's do this so it's important to

386
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,079
recognize your champions

387
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,000
we really want them to know that they're

388
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,760
doing a good job

389
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,680
we don't want them to think

390
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,240
oh i'm trying really hard to do two jobs

391
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,000
no one appreciates me and all i get is

392
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,360
one paycheck

393
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,560
we don't want them to feel like this

394
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,079
kitty

395
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,320
right like look at the

396
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,399
working for so how can we recognize them

397
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,880
you can create a certificate and put it

398
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,959
on their wall i have seen this at many

399
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,519
places if you look behind me i actually

400
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,519
have like a bunch of certificates on my

401
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,440
wall are they super official like

402
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,680
legally binding things no but did it

403
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,440
make me feel super good when i got them

404
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,040
yes it did

405
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,800
you can recognize them in front of their

406
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
peers so this could be like a special

407
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,120
virtual background this could be a star

408
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,360
next to their name on your team chat

409
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,959
there's lots of different ways but to

410
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,680
make it clear this person is a champion

411
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,720
and they're special to the 30 team

412
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,240
always put a note in their performance

413
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,199
review

414
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,920
and put as much detail positive detail

415
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,079
as you can like they reported this bug

416
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,839
and they stopped this incident from

417
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,360
growing into whatever and without them

418
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
we wouldn't have found it for days and

419
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,160
like their contribution saved thousands

420
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,480
of dollars or hundreds of hours or from

421
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,120
us filling data the more detail you do

422
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,079
the more it means to them

423
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,320
tell their boss every single big thing

424
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,680
that they do

425
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,760
and send them an email so they know that

426
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,040
you noticed

427
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,760
i had a boss once and uh

428
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,279
i was telling him i was quitting and

429
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,279
going to another team and he's like why

430
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,040
you're my best employee and i was like

431
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,880
what he's like yeah like literally every

432
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,399
day there's an email from some team

433
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,920
saying you did something amazing for

434
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,279
them

435
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,880
for six months he'd never told me that

436
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,639
any team he'd never said i did a good

437
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,880
job ever and i'd switched to another

438
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,720
team because the manager kept saying i

439
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,000
was doing a good job even though i

440
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,600
wasn't even on his team

441
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,680
that boss was nicer

442
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,880
okay reward

443
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,360
reward your champions

444
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,680
reinforce good behavior instead of

445
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,839
punishing bad behavior this is the thing

446
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,560
that works with a lot of people like i

447
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,240
mean if someone does something really

448
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,160
grave and awful you may have to dismiss

449
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,800
them but generally we want to reinforce

450
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,240
good behavior with positive

451
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,680
reinforcement

452
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,360
so

453
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,920
anything that's even remotely reasonable

454
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,320
reward them like anything like you

455
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,759
showed up to three lunch and learns in a

456
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,079
row whoop you get us you get an i'm a

457
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,720
security champion coffee mug

458
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,680
so

459
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,160
you can give them a security gift

460
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,560
this is like double whammy of awesome

461
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,720
because they feel good and you're

462
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,000
tricking them into learning more

463
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,240
security stuff yes

464
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,120
so like books videos training a ticket

465
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,680
to a ctf like pancake on ctf

466
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,440
um giving them your time and attention

467
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,639
is a reward um when i started like being

468
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,000
the senior tech for dev teams uh i read

469
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,519
a lot of books about management

470
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,880
leadership because i was like i don't

471
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,920
know what i'm doing just because i'm

472
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,279
good at coding doesn't mean i'm good at

473
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,639
managing

474
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,720
um and also i could be like a bit

475
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,959
intense and direct at times and so i

476
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,519
wanted to like be softer and be a type

477
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,839
of boss i would like to have so i

478
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,360
learned a lot and one of the things that

479
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,440
said to do is if someone comes to your

480
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,600
desk don't just keep typing or whatever

481
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,560
like

482
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,680
you know when you finish the thing

483
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,720
you're doing

484
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,120
burn your body physically and look at

485
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,560
their face do not look at your damn

486
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,680
phone don't fold your phone put your

487
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,040
phone down whatever you're doing and you

488
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
look at them

489
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,120
it makes them know that they matter and

490
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,720
that might sound really ridiculous but

491
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,399
like with a security person like they

492
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,560
know our time is short and when you make

493
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,240
time for one-on-one with them because

494
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,759
they've asked for it

495
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,720
it makes them know they matter to you

496
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,399
help them with more than just security

497
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,199
my friend ray from hella secure

498
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,959
he used to be a software architect so

499
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,240
he's like yeah i'll just come architect

500
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,079
it with you whatever i'll help like i'm

501
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,199
your guy

502
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,520
and like that got him into lots of

503
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,359
meetings meeting more devs and finding

504
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,599
more champions and then they knew that

505
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,839
they could rely on him if they needed

506
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,559
him and so he built an amazing champions

507
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,400
program and he has a blog about it on

508
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,280
hellasecure.com

509
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,359
anyway it's awesome you should check it

510
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,880
out

511
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,039
let them see cool new stuff first let

512
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,520
them help you make decisions because not

513
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,960
only does it make them feel like they

514
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,679
matter but they know tons of stuff

515
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,039
want their opinion

516
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,640
anything else that you can think of to

517
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
make them feel rewarded

518
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,440
do it it's worth it

519
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,679
lastly the hardest step this is the

520
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,880
hardest step

521
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
don't stop

522
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,200
i get um so i do like a lot of a little

523
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,360
one-off call consulting things through

524
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,679
um this company called ian's

525
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,320
research and tons of calls i get there

526
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,160
like yeah we did like

527
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,320
six events in three months and then we

528
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,840
ran out of steam and that was like two

529
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,520
years ago and like we want to like

530
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,360
restart our program meanwhile the

531
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,880
champions are like where'd they go what

532
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,720
did i do wrong

533
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
and then we make a plan to like be more

534
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,640
consistent

535
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,080
spread their stuff out over longer

536
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,600
periods of time so they don't run out of

537
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,559
steam

538
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,280
so when in doubt over communicate

539
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,080
if you do not communicate regularly it

540
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,919
will disappear quickly

541
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,600
um so you want to whenever possible

542
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,039
even if you just send an email to say

543
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,799
like hey it's december

544
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,320
and you know how december is because

545
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,000
every major religion has an amazing

546
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,720
holiday during this month and then like

547
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,480
kids have time off school and there's

548
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,679
all these other things happening so

549
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,960
we're not going to meet this month but i

550
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,480
just want you to know

551
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,320
that we are meeting in january we're

552
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,400
going to meeting about blah and like

553
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
here's um like a podcast i listen to

554
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,600
that's really cool that i thought you

555
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,679
might like and that's it it's just the

556
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,200
touch base that you're still there

557
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,640
you're still listening so other tips

558
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,679
don't let it slip be consistent

559
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,600
even if you just meet with them once a

560
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,440
month to check in and see if they need

561
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,480
you even if you just phone like hey we

562
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,080
haven't talked in a while

563
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,600
i wanted to see if you need anything i'm

564
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,039
really sorry i got caught up in this

565
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,240
project

566
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,400
what's going on

567
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,840
some champions will need more of your

568
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
time than others and some of them i

569
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,960
don't want to say they're going to be a

570
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,559
dud but they're going to do

571
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,200
exactly the minimum amount still way

572
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,440
better than no champion

573
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,960
if you have dropped your schedule pick

574
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,640
it back up even if you just send them an

575
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,559
email to tell them that you are going to

576
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,080
pick it back up

577
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,919
totally good enough

578
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,559
a culture is a practice like yoga

579
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,520
so

580
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,600
basically every you have to you can't

581
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,760
just do yoga once in january

582
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,440
and then in april you're like oh why am

583
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,360
i so stiff i did yoga like four months

584
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,440
ago i should feel fine

585
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,120
you have to do it over and over again to

586
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,160
make it a practice and culture is a

587
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,640
practice so it must be

588
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,559
forced all the time

589
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,720
and it can really fall apart fast on you

590
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,480
like you don't realize it and six months

591
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,840
have gone by

592
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,520
you're just busy

593
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,559
and then your program doesn't exist

594
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,200
so what is the recipe that we followed

595
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,360
we're awesome we're giving high fives

596
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,000
because we did it and now

597
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,039
we are on to urban gardening

598
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,840
so

599
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,600
um so i thought

600
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,280
that i had

601
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,960
actually let me go back so i thought

602
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,039
that i had a black thumb

603
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,520
so i i do lots of gardening now and if

604
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,360
you follow me on twitter i share

605
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,640
pictures from my garden often but when i

606
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,200
started it i sucked sucked really bad

607
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,960
everything i grew died

608
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,720
i tried with my mom

609
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,760
everything we died we both really sucked

610
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,480
because we're both from urban places

611
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,240
where like we lived in apartment

612
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,320
buildings and we'd never had ground

613
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,400
before like earth before we'd always

614
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,440
lived in these concrete jungles and so

615
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,360
i became good at it and so did she but

616
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,640
i'm going to tell you my story not my

617
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
mom's story because it's not

618
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,080
not here but basically i was really not

619
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,600
good at it i tried a bunch of times i

620
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,240
was convinced i was no good and then

621
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,440
so i grew these i grew these beautiful

622
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,320
um

623
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,080
i grew these beautiful tomatoes and this

624
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,919
beautiful watermelon i actually grew

625
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,000
five watermelons and i live in canada

626
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,520
it's really hard to grow

627
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,880
melons so i'm very proud of myself so

628
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,600
how i started um so i actually

629
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,080
left work for several weeks at one point

630
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,919
because i had burnout um so basically a

631
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,000
fellow employee had a break

632
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,080
with reality she had some mental illness

633
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,400
and she attacked me and then i got very

634
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,000
anxious and then

635
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,480
went for several weeks off work because

636
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,919
it's kind of hard not to be afraid that

637
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,520
someone might attack you when literally

638
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,600
a person attacked you and they're still

639
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,720
in the office because they got a

640
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,480
doctor's note that they're okay and also

641
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,159
all the men hid

642
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,520
while it was happening and no one helped

643
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,000
you i had to call security myself yeah

644
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,480
so i quit that place but first i took

645
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,039
11 weeks off or was eleven or eight

646
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,200
weeks off work and i was like

647
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,559
well i'm gonna read books on how to

648
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,159
recover from burnout because i'm like i

649
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,600
don't know what i'm doing

650
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,280
i've never done this before

651
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,159
and so the main thing it said to get

652
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,960
better like go see a counselor of course

653
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,679
but they're like get exercise

654
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,679
get lots of sun

655
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,679
and get grounded and by that they meant

656
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,559
literally touch dirt so i was like

657
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,400
i'm an overachiever how can i combine

658
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
these i'm like i'm gonna landscape my

659
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,840
entire property even though i don't know

660
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,840
what i'm doing i'm gonna get tons of

661
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,840
great workouts every day i'm gonna get

662
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,159
tons of sun and i'm gonna be really

663
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,840
dirty and touch all the dirt like i have

664
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,960
nothing to do

665
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,280
i'm really bad at being bored so i was

666
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,840
like i know what i'll do and so my first

667
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,960
year

668
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,799
i managed to grow

669
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,880
around 10 ish

670
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,159
tomatoes and they never turned red

671
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,320
they just were green and i was like i

672
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
suck i'm awful and then i looked at

673
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,240
recipes on the internet

674
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,360
and i

675
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,240
i sliced the tomatoes i barbecued them

676
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,799
and then i i also had grown i managed to

677
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,880
grow like only two or three hot peppers

678
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,640
that was it from all the things i

679
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,760
planted

680
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,840
and so i put those in and i put some

681
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,000
lime and some garlic and then i had

682
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,240
homemade salsa and then i gave it to all

683
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,360
my friends and they're like this is

684
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,520
amazing what are you growing next year

685
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,720
and i was like

686
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,039
oh yeah i'm gonna grow stuff next year

687
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,679
i'm gonna try this again and so

688
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,320
before i knew it i was growing all sorts

689
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,159
of things and just like learning a bit

690
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,159
at a time and so people are like oh

691
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,360
you're in good shape what are you doing

692
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,840
like oh i go to the gym as and i just

693
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,400
garden i like lift dirt and watermelons

694
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,000
and make raised beds and cut wood and

695
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,840
it might sound like a ridiculous thing

696
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,120
but um yeah so this summer i grew five

697
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,320
watermelons and here is one of them um

698
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,840
i actually have gotten to the point a

699
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,039
few years ago where i couldn't eat

700
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,559
everything so i started sharing it with

701
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,320
all my neighbors share with all my

702
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,720
friends and family and i actually even

703
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,000
have started to

704
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,600
try to donate them

705
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,000
um so that i can give like even more

706
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,840
food and so

707
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,600
i have great relationships with my

708
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,679
neighbors if you ask to borrow a tool

709
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,960
they're like sure

710
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,400
because they know that i'm gonna show up

711
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,240
with a grocery bag full of like 5000

712
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,840
vegetables at some point be like i can't

713
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,320
eat this please take this

714
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,400
um and so unlike what homer simpson said

715
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,080
you do

716
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,320
you make friends with salad do i've done

717
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,960
it

718
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,720
um so this is one single day of me

719
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
picking flowers so

720
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,960
i like i decided to grow flowers this

721
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,720
year i honestly thought it was like a

722
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,360
waste of dirt because

723
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,840
quite frankly um like you can't eat them

724
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,919
so i'm like what good are they but

725
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,279
people encouraged me and they're like

726
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,559
you should really grow flowers you'll

727
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,960
like it um and so then

728
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,200
i gave a bouquet of flowers to this

729
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,440
woman named diane across the street

730
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,960
her

731
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,520
face when i gave them to her she was so

732
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,120
so touched i'm like i'm growing flowers

733
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,360
forever throwing flowers till i die that

734
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,080
was amazing it's like every person i go

735
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,840
and visit i bring them flowers and

736
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,360
they're like oh it's so sweet i'm like

737
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,480
yes score i am distributing joy

738
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,320
you get free food exercise and lots of

739
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,679
vitamin d

740
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,360
and your property value can go up and so

741
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,640
you can even grow things in your balcony

742
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
you can grow things inside a window so

743
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,720
i'm in canada and like thoughts are

744
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,240
pretty against us so i've moved to

745
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,559
vancouver island where it's easier but

746
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,559
like i am so stubborn i was growing

747
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,640
things in auto eyes like i don't care

748
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,480
and so you can grow

749
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,520
something

750
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,679
in all places except for maybe the

751
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,080
arctic so you can have an herb garden in

752
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,000
your window and if you're worried the

753
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,360
wind is going to have coldness there's

754
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,760
like this plastic saran wrap type stuff

755
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
you can get at like the dollar store for

756
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,039
like five bucks and you put it around

757
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,799
the window and it keeps the cold in that

758
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,520
space and then it's way warmer

759
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,679
you can put small plants in a planter

760
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,799
that rests on your balcony railing and i

761
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,799
have grown like tons of herbs

762
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,640
you can't grow something with deep roots

763
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,080
so you're not going to get squash out of

764
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,840
there but there's tons of little things

765
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,600
like you could grow hot peppers that way

766
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,679
my little brother does it

767
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,440
you can dig up so

768
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,120
my first property

769
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,440
only the front weren't like where i was

770
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,840
growing it um

771
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,279
the front got sunlight and the back

772
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,200
really didn't so i ended up with a lot

773
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,640
of green tomatoes and a lot of things

774
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,159
that didn't get all the way right with

775
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,080
the short growing season and lots of

776
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,159
shade so i actually just dug up my

777
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,720
entire front yard which because i lived

778
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,919
right downtown i was like post camp

779
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,840
food and people complimented me i was

780
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,039
worried people would be like who's that

781
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,200
weirdo people loved it

782
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,520
um if you live in a cold environment you

783
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,159
can do raised beds for longer growing

784
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,440
seasons my beds were one meter above the

785
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,919
ground of dirt and that meant i had like

786
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,000
four to six weeks extra growing time

787
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,400
which in canada really counts

788
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,840
um if you live in a place where there's

789
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,240
lots of deer you could put chicken wire

790
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,080
around it so that the deer don't come

791
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,679
and say oh thanks for the veggies tanya

792
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,200
and then eat everything

793
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
if you don't have a lot of water you can

794
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,279
collect rain water and then reuse it or

795
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,039
you can even if you use a natural

796
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,960
laundry soap you can take the water

797
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,039
after your washing machine is done and

798
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,720
it'll go out and then you can water your

799
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,640
garden with it and if you use natural

800
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
soap it'll actually act as like a bug

801
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,480
repellent and then you're reusing your

802
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,760
water

803
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,520
basically you need earth

804
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,000
water and sun plus some seeds

805
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,559
have food health and joy

806
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,559
um and so

807
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,679
money

808
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,880
so

809
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,360
last summer or the summer before last my

810
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,279
neighbors said so you're growing so much

811
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,559
food and you keep giving it to us for

812
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,880
free you should make a farm stand and i

813
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,799
was like i don't i'm not gonna make it

814
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,240
like that's ridiculous i'll just give it

815
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,520
two for free they're like no we want to

816
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,279
buy it we want to support you

817
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,159
because i've made 17 raised beds and

818
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,520
three homemade

819
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
um three homemade

820
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,840
greenhouses my sweetheart and i have

821
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,440
built them together so i built the first

822
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
bunch by myself then we met and then

823
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,960
we've been building things together and

824
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,159
so

825
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,480
my sweetheart made this for me as a gift

826
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,960
for my birthday and this is all

827
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,600
reclaimed wood so all of it is from

828
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,360
skids that we found at the side of the

829
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,039
road and then we finished it and as our

830
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,559
farm stand

831
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,520
um so this year i just put stuff on the

832
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,279
edge of the farm stand put a box that

833
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,559
said like

834
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,200
this is how much things cost please pay

835
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,559
we made over five hundred dollars

836
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,679
um homemade food homegrown food

837
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,399
it tastes better it really does anyone

838
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,960
that has like grabbed a strawberry or a

839
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
raspberry like this that's right from

840
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,880
the garden and eaten it it's like eating

841
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,720
a hundred strawberries worth of flavor

842
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,159
from the grocery store they taste like

843
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,520
styrofoam

844
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,440
um our tomatoes they're just they're

845
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,000
glorious they're so incredible

846
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,080
um and it's also actually more healthy

847
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,640
for you so i live in canada and like

848
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,960
our growing season is very short

849
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,120
so we have to import a lot of our food

850
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
so a lot of you might not be aware of it

851
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,960
our food gets picked way before it's

852
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,279
ripe it goes on a truck and then right

853
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,000
when it gets to canada they gas it

854
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,720
try to force it to become ripe super

855
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,600
gross and so all of the produce kind of

856
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,399
sucks in canada for like half the year

857
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,440
and so

858
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,679
um that's why i started the greenhouses

859
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,679
so that i could have food all year and

860
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,919
so this is like two-thirds of my

861
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,679
backyard so on the left you can see my

862
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,240
first greenhouse and you can't see

863
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,679
there's a little gazebo and on the right

864
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:26,799
there's actually another great big

865
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,039
greenhouse and so this is some of these

866
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,559
are like the biggest

867
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,799
um raised beds we have and like we have

868
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,520
strawberries we have garlic garlic is so

869
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,960
easy to grow

870
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,000
it's so easy you just take the little um

871
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,279
clothes that are left that you didn't

872
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,440
eat and then you know october november

873
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
just plop them in the ground and then

874
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,480
you wait until you know july august

875
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
and then you pick them out that's it and

876
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,399
then you have garlic

877
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,120
it's awesome um so

878
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,240
yeah this is a hobby that i really enjoy

879
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,000
and for me it's not work people are like

880
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,440
wow that looks like a lot of work and

881
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,520
i'm like well you go to the gym and you

882
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,720
lift weights

883
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,640
and like you run and you do all of this

884
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,320
i move a bunch of dirt i dig and turn

885
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,520
the dirt i

886
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,960
you know put stuff in the compost

887
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,360
compost it gets a lot less gross if

888
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,720
you're doing it right anyway i want you

889
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,640
to consider growing food

890
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,440
so here is a thought

891
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,919
find a place to plant something it can

892
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,919
be small it can be literally just like a

893
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,600
small cup with some dirt in it by the

894
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,640
window

895
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,600
get some seeds and plant them

896
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,080
if you can add good stuff to the soil

897
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,000
not just water if you can put some

898
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,080
compost or some fertilizer

899
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,080
if you can't that's okay but if you can

900
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,919
it's even better more stuff will grow

901
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,320
and will grow bigger and faster

902
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,399
check on it once in a while

903
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,880
and when it looks good yank it out and

904
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,559
eat it i know that sounds really simple

905
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,559
but it's literally what i do

906
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,159
um if you want to take it to the next

907
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,480
level you can pick out the weeds you

908
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,360
don't have to though it's great um

909
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,159
like

910
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,640
it will let your your plants that you're

911
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,480
trying to grow have as much space as

912
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,240
possible to get as big and awesome as

913
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,679
possible but if you don't pick them out

914
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,120
stuff will still grow and you can still

915
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,600
eat it that's the joke your garden

916
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,279
doesn't have to look perfect to be

917
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,440
awesome and delicious

918
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,960
and with that i'm going to give you some

919
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,200
resources and then i think we have time

920
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,440
for questions which is really impressive

921
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,720
because

922
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,120
usually i go over time so

923
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,679
resources

924
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,080
so i have an online community that is

925
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,159
free it is called the we hack purple

926
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,919
community and um we have online streams

927
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,559
and we have articles and videos and

928
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,159
basically lots of awesome humans that

929
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,720
you can talk to and meet about security

930
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,519
um i have a podcast which is just about

931
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,760
to read like so we just started filming

932
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,679
the next season our first episodes with

933
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,480
adam showstack um we've already recorded

934
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,679
i just gotta get my butt around to

935
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,679
editing it and releasing it and he talks

936
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,760
about you know what is threat modeling

937
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,200
and how to do it cheap easy and fast

938
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,159
um

939
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,640
awesome books so i'm biased but i think

940
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,799
my book's awesome but also all of these

941
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,960
books are about devops and i love

942
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,159
yes um and resources

943
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,080
me

944
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,720
so i have my own blog now on she hacks

945

949
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,519
very much but anyway

950
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,320
um

951
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
and i hope all of you

952
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,519
spend your life doing strange things

953
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,399
with weird people because to me that is

954
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,720
the best type of life you can have

955
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,360
thank you very very much

956
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,039
and are there any questions

957
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,000
so uh some of the questions that came up

958
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,760
are um

959
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,000
around seeds because most folks are used

960
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,760
to working with like the seedlings where

961
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,200
something is already at a certain level

962
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,880
i put it in some dirt kind of half the

963
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,960
work's done uh what kind of advice do

964
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,600
you have with working with seeds

965
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,399
okay so if you want to pick seeds find a

966
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,399
place that sells seeds that are specific

967
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,799
for where you live so i live on the west

968
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,120
coast and so there is a company called

969
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,720
west coast seeds

970
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,159
everything they grow grow like

971
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,760
everything they sign grows really well

972
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,159
because it's only for our area does that

973
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,120
make sense and so if you so i have done

974
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,200
this where i've got seats from africa

975
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,799
and then they don't grow wanna know why

976
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,799
because i'm not in africa they kind of

977
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,399
have better weather

978
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,399
and so even though like

979
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,080
i try because i have a greenhouse and

980
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,919
stuff but at first just get seeds there

981
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,840
for your area if you want to buy

982
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,320
seedlings that's totally okay it's not

983
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,279
cheating i do that so i'll grow i'll put

984
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,720
like seeds everywhere and then some of

985
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,120
them don't come up that's fine i go get

986
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,600
seedlings and fill that part in

987
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,760
also you should be aware this is the

988
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,200
thing that has happened to me sometimes

989
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,799
seeds don't come up i plant something

990
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,000
else

991
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,960
and then the things come up later

992
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,039
or like i turn the soil for the next

993
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,000
thing and i'm like why are there

994
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,839
nasturtiums and peas growing everywhere

995
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,520
so right now one of my

996
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,280
greenhouses has like nasturtiums and

997
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,960
peas like taking over because i had

998
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,199
planted them they didn't grow and then i

999
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,199
had moved and rotated some of the dirt

1000
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,800
and turned it and then i have like just

1001
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,679
flowers and peas everywhere right now so

1002
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,520
just be aware that they might come up

1003
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
later

1004
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,480
how are bertha and enterprise doing

1005
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,520
okay so bertha is the first

1006
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,760
greenhouse that we built and she's doing

1007
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,679
really well there's like a big tree over

1008
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,599
here so my partner and i spent a day

1009
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,679
like cutting trimming the tree that's

1010
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,960
going really well that's actually where

1011
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,839
all the pieces are all over the place

1012
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,040
the enterprise is doing well however

1013
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,359
a certain someone slept in the mud while

1014
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,040
she was moving dirt

1015
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,199
and i put a hole in the plastic with my

1016
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,320
um

1017
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,240
wheelbarrow so we have to get a patch

1018
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,320
kit but it's fine we're tough and we can

1019
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,400
do it but so we're about to plant a

1020
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,760
thing there and then

1021
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,440
our third one

1022
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,000
is called um the nursery and so we just

1023
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,599
do seedlings in there so we're actually

1024
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,359
just about to plant new seedlings

1025
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,640
because we just like

1026
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,880
took out and ate all the plants that we

1027
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,760
had so yeah um all my greenhouses are

1028
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,680
doing very well and we're getting a

1029
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,520
patch kit soon

1030
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,040
and it's just a hole in one layer of

1031
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,720
plastic the other layer is still good

1032
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,079
but you can't have the holes in your

1033
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,839
greenhouse

1034
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,359
uh where do you get your uh dahlia bulbs

1035
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,320
oh okay so i got delia bulbs all over

1036
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,040
the place it was weird so i had a friend

1037
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,880
that was obsessed with dahlias and she

1038
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,160
ordered some

1039
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,160
and then she thought some of them got a

1040
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,640
disease so she gave them to me in pots

1041
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,640
but then the disease went away when they

1042
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,160
were at my house and it turned out she

1043
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,760
just has too much moisture where she

1044
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
lives and she was wiring them too much

1045
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
but anyway she's like just keep them so

1046
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,560
i had those then i went to costco i kid

1047
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,480
you not and i had a sale on dahlia bulbs

1048
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,160
so i bought a bag of those and then

1049
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,560
there's a farm down the street from me

1050
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,240
but this year what i did is i dug all

1051
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,800
the dahlia bulbs up and i'm gonna split

1052
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,560
them in the spring so that i have like a

1053
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,800
ridiculous number of dahlias they

1054
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,560
multiply so

1055
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,480
they have tubers not seed

1056
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,440
for anyone that doesn't know so it looks

1057
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
it looks like a big fat root

1058
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,680
but with a bunch of different pieces and

1059
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,000
so when the spring comes if you've

1060
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,520
picked them out

1061
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,200
if they get a little sprout on the end

1062
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,640
you can cut them and they'll be their

1063
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,440
own

1064
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,240
legit plant and so i'm pretty excited to

1065
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,320
do that because i had a ton of flour

1066
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,480
like so many flowers is ridiculous trust

1067
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,640
me

1068
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,520
so uh going back to the yoga metaphor uh

1069
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,960
switching gears right so back in the

1070
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,520
security champions half um there's the

1071
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,119
other challenge with yoga metaphor right

1072
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,359
if i'm not doing yoga then i'm gonna get

1073
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,200
stiff later on but what if i've been

1074
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,000
doing yoga the wrong way so how do i

1075
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,240
implement a security champions program

1076
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,400
where say the culture was already

1077
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,720
volunteering people to be a part of it

1078
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,839
oh

1079
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:02,880
yeah

1080
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,480
so

1081
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,920
i would

1082
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,000
so if i was a new employee going in

1083
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,960
there i would probably say

1084
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,880
i'd probably make a new plan for the

1085
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,320
champions

1086
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,000
try to make it sound super exciting and

1087
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,119
good

1088
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,440
meet with them and then say

1089
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,160
so this is your chance to rotate out if

1090
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,920
you don't want to be a champion anymore

1091
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,160
like you've done your time want to go do

1092
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,599
something else or like here's the

1093
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,359
exciting stuff we have coming and i hope

1094
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,280
that a bunch of them would stay and then

1095
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,440
i would re-recruit new ones

1096
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,119
because

1097
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,320
i don't know about you if you've ever

1098
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,839
been like told you have to do something

1099
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,760
like i had to go on the workplace safety

1100
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,680
commission thing once because like i was

1101
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,960
the newest employee and they're just

1102
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,880
like you have to be in the workplace

1103
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,480
safety thing and they would

1104
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,240
take me on these dumb tours and it's

1105
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,760
like oh you have a plant on that shelf

1106
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,200
that's unsafe you have to take it down

1107
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,599
i'm like leave her plant alone

1108
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,760
um so i went i really wasn't very good

1109
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,440
at it and it really wasn't very like

1110
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,119
enthused by and eventually like you

1111
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,480
won't even like being on i'm like my

1112
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,160
boss said i had to

1113
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,359
and they're like

1114
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,920
you're dismissed and i was like yes

1115
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,599
so you don't want a champion like that

1116
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,040
you want a champion that's like really

1117
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,400
curious and interested because they're

1118
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,480
just they're gonna do way way more for

1119
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,280
you so i would let them leave but first

1120
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,880
try to make it sound awesome so that

1121
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,200
some of them stay

1122
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,280
all right last question and then uh

1123
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,800
afraid we're gonna have to leave you

1124
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,880
alone

1125
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,960
i i did the dad jokes thing i can't help

1126
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,720
it it's it's natural

1127
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,720
um do you use cold frames in canada

1128
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,560
what's a cold frame

1129
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,920
i don't know i figured you might know

1130
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,000
what a cold frame is you're i'm gonna

1131
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,680
quit google it while you're uh we're

1132
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,000
here with a cold frame i do sometimes

1133
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,800
put like a lid on things so if you know

1134
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,200
that it's gonna frost that night if you

1135
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,079
can cover your garden

1136
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,760
um so a lot of people here what they do

1137
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,599
is they'll have a raised bed and then

1138
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,280
they have like a garden

1139
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,599
lid that's plastic and metal and they

1140
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,560
lift it up all day and then when the sun

1141
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,280
goes down they close all of them so that

1142
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,960
the coal doesn't hurt the plants because

1143
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,280
they can go they can dip below zero and

1144
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
then all the plants are except kale

1145
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,240
kale's like i'm kale i don't care

1146
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,119
[Laughter]

1147
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,599
seriously kale like it snowed here and

1148
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,680
kale's just like whatever i'm kale i'm

1149
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,520
never leaving you

1150
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,320
yeah

1151
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,680
i feel like it does the same thing to

1152
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,880
the your digestive system

1153
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,720
i don't know i like kale but it's not

1154
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,839
for everyone

1155
