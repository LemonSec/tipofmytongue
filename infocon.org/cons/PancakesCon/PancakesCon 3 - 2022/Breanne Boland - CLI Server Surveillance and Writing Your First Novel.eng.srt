1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,000
we have brienne boland and she's going

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,480
to tell us about cli server surveillance

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,639
and also writing your first novel i'm

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,400
excited for this talk thank you for

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,400
being here bien yeah thank you so much

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,320
for having me

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,759
all right one second let's get some

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,560
slides shared

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,199
all right um what an amazing talk to get

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,640
to follow uh

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,080
that's spectacular i couldn't have hoped

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,519
for a better lead-in

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,160
hello yeah welcome to uh cli survivor

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,840
surveillance and then abrupt subject

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,520
change writing your first novel a talk

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,840
in two parts

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,840
to start um give you

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,480
two parts of who i am uh i'm a security

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,320
partner on the gusto product security

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,320
team i'm someone who likes poking around

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,920
in linux and i'm still delighted by what

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,199
you can do on the command line hence

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,559
this talk

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,879
and more word-wise i've been a fiction

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,199
writer since i was about 12.

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,719
i have a writing degree it is the only

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,079
degree i have

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,520
and i'm someone who got through the

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,959
pandemic so far anyway by writing a lot

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,560
like a huge amount

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,159
um as a result as you might guess i'm

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,520
also that person who likes writing

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,760
documentation i'm not talking about that

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,520
today but i am at b-side san francisco

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,280
in may uh so i hope you can join us

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,200
uh for you because i am a person who

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,960
surprised learns better by reading

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,880
rather than watching video i made a blog

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,400
post version of this talk so you can

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,960
follow along it's at briennebolin.com

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,720
um if you really like the second half of

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,240
my talk i have a writing newsletter that

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,520
comes out monthly is probably going to

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,200
come out in the next week

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,680
and i've linked everything at twitter so

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,880
easy

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,040
and if you have questions uh i will be

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,320
in slack after this if there's any

49
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,439
questions we don't get to at the end of

50
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,360
the video feel free to at me i'll

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
probably be hovering around all day once

52
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,200
i do my post talk crashing

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,680
all right talk the first

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,640
cli server surveillance

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,240
which means that we have to talk about

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,079
ossent

57
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,520
osint if you haven't bumped into it is

58
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,479
open source intelligence um and it is

59
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,000
super fun it's one of the reasons that i

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,399
was so excited this talk got accepted

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,318
so what we'll be doing with the command

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,760
line uh stuff we're going to talk about

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,520
in a minute is ocean which is when you

64
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,680
use publicly excuse me publicly

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,599
available information to learn more

66
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,920
about a site a company a network or some

67
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,520
other entity with the goal of creating a

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,120
more complete picture than the

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,879
information they released was probably

70
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,720
meant to give you

71
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,400
the commands and how i will suggest

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,239
doing them are all legal to use but i've

73
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,720
noted certain uses here and there that

74
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
might cross the line and please don't do

75
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,800
that if in doubt remember that typically

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
one person using one command is fine

77
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,800
but scripting something that hammers a

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,560
target especially without permission is

79
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,400
a bad idea for a whole bunch of reasons

80
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,840
and then before we get any further a

81
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,480
little note on systems and context i am

82
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,160
mac-based so the things i say

83
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,400
unavoidably are slanted by that

84
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
the linux commands and flags are often

85
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,560
the same but not always

86
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,640
and i also note how to do these things

87
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
on windows in a light way you know

88
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
different command names stuff like that

89
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
um you're gonna have to experiment but i

90
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,319
promise you that's actually the fun part

91
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,560
too

92
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,400
so why do we need to know this stuff

93
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
like why can it help you in your job

94
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,560
i've most often used the tools and the

95
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,480
methods i'm about to describe when i was

96
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,080
researching a target for work with the

97
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,640
permission of the owners and servers uh

98
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,120
legally vetted written permission

99
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,959
glorious um

100
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,959
in my last job i sometimes did timebox

101
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,799
pen testing for potential vendors and i

102
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,159
would start out in the big picture way

103
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,840
we're about to walk through

104
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,360
um what can i figure out about how this

105
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,040
site runs based on just what is in the

106
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,080
public

107
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,519
and so that's the approach that i take

108
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,879
to these tools in the first half of the

109
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,920
talk

110
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,360
without setting off alarms on the side

111
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,640
of the folks who use the servers and

112
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,560
without being destructive what can i

113
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,799
learn

114
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,760
as a friend likes to say

115
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,920
you have to be specific to be terrific

116
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,439
so let's figure out what success looks

117
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,640
like here are the questions we want to

118
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,439
answer

119
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,280
what is the server doing what do we

120
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,439
think it's running what ports are open

121
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,120
who owns the server who's the domain

122
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,959
registered with and then what name

123
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,959
servers hold the record for this domain

124
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,959
all the tools i'm about to describe are

125
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,120
either available on a fresh os doll or

126
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,720
so standard that installing them is

127
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,399
super well documented

128
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,199
um

129
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
i say with a fair amount of certainty

130
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,959
which ones are which i did have to send

131
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,560
some quick text to my boyfriend to run

132
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,400
some commands on his mac which is a nice

133
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,000
normal person computer because there are

134
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
certain things i honestly don't remember

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
if i had to install or not

136
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,400
um all the links uh to all this stuff

137
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,080
are in the blog post to the talk so if

138
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,600
you want to do that you can dive in over

139
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,440
there

140
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,600
let's get to the tools

141
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,880
first we're going to talk about

142
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,880
something basic and pretty wonderful

143
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
we're going to talk about ping

144
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,320
ping can answer

145
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,400
is this server up and also what's the

146
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
server's ip

147
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,400
and how it does this ping uses icmp

148
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,800
that's internet control message protocol

149
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,479
it's a protocol in the same way as like

150
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,720
http or ftp plus a bunch of others

151
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,800
although it's part of the internet layer

152
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,280
and those others are application layer

153
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
tracer trace route which we'll talk

154
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,759
about in a few minutes also uses icmp

155
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,120
and it's a common protocol for

156
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,720
diagnostic stuff

157
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
it is an ipv4 tool although there's an

158
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
ipv6 version out there too called

159
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,759
appropriately ping six

160
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,600
so ping at its heart is used for

161
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,120
diagnostics because you get an echo

162
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,039
reply from the host uh if you're the one

163
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,199
you're pointing it to is out there

164
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,360
implementations do vary a little bit um

165
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,520
payload size time to live time to wait

166
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,120
for a response

167
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,880
and probably the best thing i found out

168
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,240
about this when i was researching is

169
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,400
that sometimes the yucca reply is called

170
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,400
pong

171
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,639
so when do we use it for good things um

172
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,479
my most common use of it honestly has

173
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,240
been outside of work stuff when i

174
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,759
realized my internet connection is being

175
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,960
a little bit funky and i want a quick

176
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,039
sense of how broken stuff might be

177
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,880
it's a really good nice quick diagnostic

178
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,080
tool when you're trying to figure out

179
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,759
where to start with troubleshooting

180
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,759
is it zero percent packet loss is a

181
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,440
hundred percent or

182
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,000
kinda worse is it something in between

183
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
it's also one quick way to get an ip

184
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,440
from a url

185
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,880
it's great for quietly checking if a

186
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,039
server is live or if it exists

187
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,400
and it's also possible to change the

188
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
origin of a ping although of course that

189
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,679
rules out getting a response

190
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,960
but what about the more nefarious stuff

191
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,919
i'm i'm gonna go a little more into

192
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,199
depth with this one than the others just

193
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,600
because they're so good and weird like i

194
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,280
love them so much even though none of us

195
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,720
should do this

196
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
uh one version is a ping flood an

197
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,240
avalanche of ping requests that don't

198
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,160
wait for a response with the goal of

199
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,319
overwhelming the target you know classic

200
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,160
denial of service stuff

201
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,840
but then there's another version which

202
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,919
instead of many many many normal-sized

203
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,919
pings there's one giant ping and it's

204
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,000
called the ping of death this is one of

205
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
my favorite phrases i ever learned at

206
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,199
def con and i'm really happy i get to

207
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,759
say it to you today ping of death

208
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,000
uh yeah older systems would crash or

209
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,759
experience buffer overflow if you sent a

210
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,880
packet bigger than 65 535 bytes the size

211
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,759
of a correctly formed ipv4 packet

212
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,840
and this sounds very you know it sounds

213
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,520
older and it is it has largely been

214
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,039
mitigated via firewalls and other

215
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,120
methods but a version of it was

216
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,280
exploited as recently as 2013 against a

217
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,919
version of windows it's patched now but

218
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,080
2013 that is really recent history

219
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,000
so a few examples

220
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,599
just do ping and you can you can use the

221
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,919
url or the ip to get that going

222
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,800
uh

223
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,840
if you like noise dash a means that it

224
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,720
will go every time it returns one um

225
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,400
maybe you're into that

226
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,759
uh dash c

227
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,280
give lets you add a parameter so it

228
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,000
stops after in this example five pings

229
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
uh dash i lets you set the number of

230
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,080
seconds between pings

231
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,360
and for windows uh just type in cmd on

232
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,680
the command shell type ping and you're

233
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,160
in business

234
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,879
next up we have curl

235
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,240
uh curl

236
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,039
is a wonderful

237
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,319
it's straightforward but you can use it

238
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,160
for so many things in our case we will

239
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,080
use it to answer questions like what is

240
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,720
the server serving um what server

241
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,039
software is it running and what version

242
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,280
and what http response code does it

243
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,599
return to various requests

244
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,680
so curl is short for client url it

245
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,479
debuted in 1996 which makes it a nice

246
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,440
recent

247
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,039
newcomer as compared to ping which came

248
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,199
from late 1983.

249
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,879
and i like curl either because i want to

250
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,479
see something from a server but not in a

251
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,479
browser or i want to see information

252
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,840
from the server that typically doesn't

253
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,400
appear in the browser

254
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
so a few examples

255
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,240
i like plain old curl if i'm curious

256
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,760
about what's behind the phishing urls

257
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
and texts but for obvious reasons don't

258
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,880
want to open that in my browser

259
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,479
it makes it a little less bleak to have

260
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,120
people trying to pray at me on my phone

261
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,560
if i can do a little digging to see what

262
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,320
they're trying to do

263
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,839
uh my favorite one the one that i've

264
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,440
used the most often for work purposes is

265
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,839
curl dash capital i url it is case

266
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:52,880
sensitive

267
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,640
which gets you headers and that's where

268
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,000
you get to see things like what server

269
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,920
software is running and if they haven't

270
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,240
removed it from their headers maybe what

271
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,160
version it is if you're super lucky you

272
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,920
get a finding because it might be an

273
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
older version with a confirmed

274
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,000
vulnerability attached that's an amazing

275
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,920
day

276
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,600
and that is the same as curl dash dash

277
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,920
head url if you prefer it and find it

278
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,560
easier easier to remember

279
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,000
and as with

280
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,440
most command line things you can add a

281
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,959
little dash v for some more details

282
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,240
about certs tls handshakes ip addresses

283
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,120
ports

284
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,560
just the general nuts and bolts what's

285
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,760
going on

286
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,600
it is available in windows the same way

287
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,440
as ping open the command shell and just

288
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,399
type curl

289
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,440
all right next we have nmap and i was

290
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
excited to already get to hear about

291
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,080
this in the talk

292
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,480
nmap is short for network mapper and you

293
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,839
might have to install this one but the

294
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,519
instructions are super clear because

295
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,440
everyone wants to do it or if you're on

296
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,399
a mac

297
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,480
re-install nmap

298
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,000
the questions that nmap can answer

299
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,519
include what ports are open that i could

300
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,839
possibly connect to and from that a lot

301
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,440
of times you can deduce what software

302
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,200
might be running

303
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,279
so what does nmap do um

304
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,720
there are lots and lots of different

305
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,240
kinds of scans you can go really deep

306
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,760
with this tool

307
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,440
which means it can also be really noisy

308
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,519
if you're trying to scan things quietly

309
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,440
so keep that in mind

310
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,000
it uses ping but it can also use tcp udp

311
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,959
and other options to do your

312
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,560
reconnaissance

313
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,399
nmap is one of those tools where

314
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,160
you can use five percent of it and do

315
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,680
really cool stuff

316
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,279
but there are other amazing depths to be

317
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,720
found if you put the time into it and

318
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,160
luckily um

319
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,200
there are

320
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
an astonishing amount of tutorials about

321
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
it online i've linked a couple in the

322
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,720
blog post

323
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,760
but mostly here we're going to talk

324
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,880
about port scanning because we're

325
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,240
looking at other people's servers not

326
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,760
investigating other networks we're

327
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,200
already in but it's really good for that

328
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,959
too

329
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,880
so some examples

330
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,600
if you do nmap dash pe and a number of

331
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,279
the port that you want to scan plus the

332
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,680
url or ip it will look at just one port

333
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,760
until it gets open you can add a range

334
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,200
with dash p

335
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,360
0 to 10 23 for instance if you want to

336
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,240
do

337
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,760
reserved ports

338
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,360
and you can do dash capital f if you

339
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,600
want to do a faster

340
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,279
a faster more targeted scan with fewer

341
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,959
ports than the default

342
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,959
and yes this is absolutely installable

343
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,599
on windows

344
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,120
all right next up we're going to talk

345
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,200
about netcat also known as ncat also

346
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,720
known as nc

347
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,560
and the questions it can answer is also

348
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,320
is this port open but there's an

349
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,160
interesting extra level of like getting

350
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,839
in the weeds here which is how do i

351
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,720
write a get or other request

352
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,399
because what it does uh it's generally

353
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,160
good for networking things it can be a

354
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,920
quick way to see if a port is open but

355
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,360
beyond that it's a neat tool that puts

356
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,519
you right in the middle of requests you

357
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,519
can start a connection with the server

358
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,120
it keeps a prompt open and then you can

359
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,040
just send your request and figure out

360
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,399
how to craft it and see what you get in

361
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,760
response it can be really interesting

362
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,200
for exploring

363
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,320
you can get some visibility into

364
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,079
networks with it and also it's just fun

365
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,680
to mess with what can you get

366
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,680
so a few examples

367
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,880
uh netcat

368
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,120
vz with the url in the port sees the

369
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,240
port is open just can be a little

370
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,160
quicker than nmap sometimes

371
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,040
add dash z for zero input output so just

372
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,079
scanning

373
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,399
um vrv if you want to see verbosity and

374
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,240
it gets really verbose sometimes so you

375
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,160
can really dive in

376
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,560
capital t for telnet which is amazing

377
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,040
dash lowercase t for tcp mode and then

378
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
if you want to just dive in right now

379
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,839
try netcat vt google.com80 so that gives

380
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,399
us verbose and tcp mode and then write

381
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,880
get slash index.html and it will spill

382
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,560
that out to you

383
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,279
uh yeah try ncat for windows and map.org

384
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,240
has the download you need

385
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,320
so next up is a really fun one this is

386
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,519
traceroute

387
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,480
um

388
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,160
also known as i believe it's tracert on

389
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,360
windows

390
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,120
questions traceroute can answer and

391
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
sometimes it just starts it opens more

392
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,839
questions than it answers and you

393
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,360
one you know end up in a beautiful

394
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,760
blossoming of networking knowledge

395
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,519
but it can tell you uh what equipment

396
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,880
sits between you and the server you're

397
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,519
trying to connect to who hosts the site

398
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,120
and also what does a request journey

399
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,279
across the internet look like

400
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,839
uh traceroute is super cool

401
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,680
just to tip my cards i think it's great

402
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,440
it's another diagnostic program in the

403
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,800
tradition of ping

404
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,880
it shows possible routes between your

405
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,240
computer and the server you're trying to

406
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,000
reach plus possibly transit delays

407
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,279
across the network

408
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,320
uh

409
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,839
ping only does round trip times with

410
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,680
success or failure traceroute shows you

411
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,360
everything in between

412
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,560
it's a really fun way to get to know

413
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
some networking stuff like the private

414
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,079
ips on your home devices and what it

415
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,600
looks like when your request is making

416
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,519
its way out of your isp's domain into

417
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,120
the open internet and what it looks like

418
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
when the request resolves

419
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,320
and the really cool thing is the route

420
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,680
most likely is going to be a little

421
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,200
different every time if you run it

422
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,560
multiple times you get to see a little

423
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,360
bit more of the world every time you do

424
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,279
and when you do it you will probably get

425
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,639
some lines of output that just have

426
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,959
asterisks this could mean timeouts it

427
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,360
can mean firewalls that keep data from

428
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
being sent back to you or it can mean

429
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,199
equipment configured to reject icmp

430
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,199
packets which are not always prioritized

431
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,720
generally i've used this just as is

432
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,199
you know traceroute with the url or ip

433
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,399
uh it was a favorite tool in the

434
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,160
networking class i took at the bradfield

435
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,240
school of computer science few years ago

436
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,399
you've never seen so many nerds in a

437
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,760
small classroom leaning forward and

438
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,720
watching terminal output so intently

439
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,160
the various flags though do let you

440
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,800
control tcp versus icmp for requests the

441
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
number of probe packets per hop it

442
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,160
defaults to three

443
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,240
uh wait times ports times to live stuff

444
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,360
like that

445
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,760
and it defaults to ipv4 but you can

446
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,320
specify either that or ipv6 with dash

447
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,720
four or six flags

448
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,880
um but yeah traceroute with the url the

449
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,120
ip gets you a lot of what you want here

450
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,480
uh run it more than once tinker with

451
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,399
flags you learn something cool even if

452
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,120
it's

453
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,959
oh i don't need to do that again because

454
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,760
that's knowledge too

455
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,360
next up

456
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,720
who is

457
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,199
so questions as answers uh and note my

458
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,639
qualifiers which i'll explain in a

459
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,760
minute

460
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,519
what are the possible name servers of

461
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,720
this domain

462
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,519
who maybe owns this block of ips who's

463
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,480
the

464
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,360
likely register for this domain

465
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
so who is what does it do it works on

466
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,480
both urls and ips and if you poke at ips

467
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,760
with it it's extra fun because you might

468
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,240
get details about a cedar or cider range

469
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,920
pronounced the way you like

470
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,839
which is a notation for designating

471
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,839
blocks of ip addresses which often is

472
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,320
often how people buy or control them

473
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,959
if you look up cidr.xyz

474
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,880
it's a the best tool that i found for

475
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,279
understanding what this means

476
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,800
so for urls you can get name server

477
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,720
details other stuff the internet

478
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,040
assigned numbers authority stores

479
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,880
and it can also begin to tell you who

480
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,120
might own a domain or ip and where their

481
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,880
information is stored where the site's

482
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,399
hosted where the domains registered and

483
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,240
some other technical details

484
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,600
there may be contact information in

485
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,720
there but most often it's business

486
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,079
details these days so it might not

487
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,759
actually tell you much

488
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,920
but here's where the qualifiers come in

489
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,839
it gets its information from a whois

490
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,560
server i think a database of we expect

491
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,120
things to look like this which is

492
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,880
as probably everyone watching this knows

493
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,040
very well not the same as things are

494
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,279
definitely like this in practice it's

495
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,720
still useful though

496
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,560
and sometimes it's handy to see what

497
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,399
things once were like or were expected

498
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,160
to be because an ocean additional

499
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,680
information even if it's no longer

500
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
correct today that suggested the state

501
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,519
of things before you can still tell the

502
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,240
stuff that we need to know

503
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,279
so if you want to get a little sense of

504
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,480
what's going on

505
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,320
you can just put who is in your url or

506
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,800
if you want to put an ip um the quad 8

507
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,240
has some fun output so you can get a

508
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,680
sense of the possibilities if you dive

509
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,079
into that

510
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,000
all right next up let's talk about a

511
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,440
compliment to who is and the thing you

512
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,720
might actually want to reach for more

513
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,040
but it's useful to have both

514
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,320
digg the domain information groper this

515
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,759
one can answer things like what's

516
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,199
lurking in the dns records for this

517
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,160
domain which the domain's actual active

518
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
today name servers have to say about

519
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,759
this

520
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,600
digg provides dns records for provided

521
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
domain which can include some fun weird

522
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,519
stuff especially in the text records and

523
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,759
i was delighted that um two sessions ago

524
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,199
on this track andrew lemon talked about

525
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,800
this uh

526
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,000
he got he

527
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,759
i suggest some things he digs deeper

528
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,800
into them so if you're interested in

529
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,959
this which it's worth digging into go

530
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,240
and check out what he had to say about

531
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,679
it

532
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,039
so information comes from the domain's

533
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,959
name servers it uses dns information

534
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,880
which same information used to resolve

535
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,760
the domain that you put in your

536
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,599
browser's address bar

537
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,839
and dns is the authoritative source here

538
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,720
if in doubt go with dig and also a note

539
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,240
if there are many ips that resolve for a

540
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,760
domain it'll show you four

541
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,359
so the classic is just dig with your url

542
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,520
url or ip but if you want to see more

543
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,799
what's going on

544
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,200
add plus trace uh and it will show you

545
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,679
exactly how it does the search

546
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,280
and if you uh

547
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,400
add

548
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,120
your the desired dns record type at the

549
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,520
end so it can be txt it can be mx it can

550
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
be cname any of them

551
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,440
it lets you poke around some more

552
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,919
for reconnaissance text records are my

553
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,760
favorite because they're used for so

554
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,200
many weird things um i have a real love

555
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,160
for

556
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,360
grab bags of the old internet in

557
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,840
dns text records are one of my favorite

558
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,919
the most commonly the thing i've seen

559
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,760
most often include spf records which is

560
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,520
sender policy framework

561
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,200
um those are records that reduce spam

562
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,039
and fraud via email

563
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,640
but where it gets especially interesting

564
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,600
too

565
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,840
is that text records are

566
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,000
oddly often used to verify that you

567
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
control a domain for companies that need

568
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,240
to work with you in that respect so you

569
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,840
can look at text records and get a sense

570
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,080
of what marketing software a company

571
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,000
uses or if they have certain like

572
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,400
facebook integrations like really weird

573
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,720
stuff lurks in there so it's always

574
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,840
worth checking out if you're trying to

575
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,160
get a really thorough picture of stuff

576
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,039
um there's also i think there's some

577
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,120
it's a pretty high limit on how much

578
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
stuff you can stuff in there uh

579
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,799
there's a reason that corey quinn calls

580
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,760
route 53 the only database with 100

581
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,360
reliable sla

582
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,559
because you can put all kinds of things

583
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,480
in there it's just a key value store and

584
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,039
people do

585
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,840
a thing to note um depending on how

586
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,679
you're using this stuff host might be

587
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,280
better for your purposes

588
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,640
it does something similar but it only

589
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,320
returns a little information in a more

590
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,840
predictable form

591
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,240
so ip if you provide the domain domain

592
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,400
name pointer if you give it an ip if

593
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,679
you're using it in a script and you just

594
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,039
want to use a little bit of the output

595
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,120
maybe by processing with awk this can be

596
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,520
simpler for you

597
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,559
i wonder if anyone can hear the

598
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,440
screaming kid across the street

599
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,120
okay i also wanted to leave you with a

600
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,360
handful of useful non-cli tools that

601
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,760
complement this stuff really well

602
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,520
so yeah let's find out your free osint

603
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,640
tool set

604
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,600
um i really like a tool called wapalizer

605
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
which uh no matter how many times i

606
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,640
practice this talk that does not get

607
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,720
less weird to say but what apple hazard

608
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,480
is really great um it has chrome and

609
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,320
firefox extensions among other aspects

610
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,160
of its product product that tell you the

611
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,280
tech stack

612
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,240
uh of any site you visit in the browser

613
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,679
and it gets really detailed you might

614
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,799
open it and there'll be like 12

615
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,320
different entries of just different

616
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,400
javascript libraries and oh this is ruby

617
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
on rails

618
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,919
it gives you more information than you

619
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,280
might think so it's worth keeping around

620
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,320
if you're going to do this kind of thing

621
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,320
if you're looking to be thorough

622
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
also look at company press releases

623
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,559
articles and interviews um both with

624
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,559
engineering and with executives because

625
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,480
uh surprise people in different parts of

626
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,760
the company tell different parts of the

627
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,799
story

628
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,840
if you want to get a sense of what

629
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,520
they're doing what they're planning and

630
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,960
sometimes more importantly how they talk

631
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,400
about themselves check that out

632
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,440
you can also look at the company on

633
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,280
github and see what repos they have made

634
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,320
public

635
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,400
and if you complement that against

636
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,840
what you know that they're doing that

637
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,039
isn't public that can tell you some

638
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,480
stuff

639
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,360
linkedin the classic

640
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,559
just to get an idea of staffing

641
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,640
especially security teams

642
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,240
and of course

643
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,679
never underestimate viewing the page

644
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,840
source although

645
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,120
use this at your own risk if you live in

646
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,440
missouri

647
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,039
and also there are other great libraries

648
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,799
like i stumbled on one that's in python

649
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,720
called ocean and it bundles a lot of the

650
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,480
stuff we just talked about together in a

651
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,840
way that's really easy to dig into

652
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,039
so yeah coming to the end of part one uh

653
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,960
you can do it these are fun and useful

654
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,559
ways to learn about tools and computers

655
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,480
get a sense of how networks work and

656
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
learn things about a target

657
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,760
individually they're powerful and useful

658
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,679
if simple but if you combine them into

659
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,120
scripts that give pretty output that

660
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,880
matches how your brain works you can do

661
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,840
some amazing stuff

662
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,840
and part one

663
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,880
and now for something completely

664
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,960
different

665
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,480
let's talk about writing your first

666
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,880
novel

667
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,200
going back to specificness and

668
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,720
terrificness here's what we're going to

669
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,520
do

670
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,640
we're going to talk about how to

671
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,320
complete a first draft without feeling

672
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,840
terrible a whole lot because you don't

673
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,120
need to

674
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,240
you're going to know exactly what a

675
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,080
first draft means we're going to talk

676
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,679
about what exactly a novel is because

677
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,679
it's a word that gets thrown around

678
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,360
and you're gonna know what a first draft

679
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,280
doesn't include which

680
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,039
maybe is more important than possibly

681
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,159
anything we're talking about here just

682
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,320
to know exactly what you're doing

683
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,400
so first draft you start in one place

684
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,159
and you end up in another things happen

685
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,200
in between

686
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,799
that is enough you have achieved first

687
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,039
draftness wonderful

688
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,320
most likely though you're going to end

689
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,600
up managing more than that as you go

690
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,679
along you will create people you will

691
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,960
get a view into a world you've been

692
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,400
making

693
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,919
when the first draft is done the

694
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,440
arrangement of all the islands and your

695
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,679
little imagination archipelago it's

696
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,120
probably not final

697
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
but the land is there once you've

698
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,480
written the whole thing

699
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,000
just for your definition of the whole

700
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,440
thing

701
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,559
and you have to be clear when i say a

702
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,240
novel for our purposes i'm referring to

703
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,919
a work of fiction that's usually between

704
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,280
about seventy thousand a hundred

705
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,880
thousand words although epic fantasy can

706
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,159
go longer

707
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,640
um it can and likely will at some point

708
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,159
incorporate something from your life if

709
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,000
only feelings but

710
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,080
generally it's made of stuff you made up

711
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,360
we'll talk about revisions just a little

712
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,799
bit because the great thing about a

713
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,440
first draft is it's by definition not a

714
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,400
second draft and not a final draft

715
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,559
um but why write a novel you have enough

716
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,960
going on why would you want to

717
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,799
to start for some of us it's really fun

718
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,120
maybe that's you it could be you even if

719
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,720
you've never considered it

720
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,880
maybe you have a character a scene or a

721
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,080
place in your head that you really want

722
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,919
to put into words maybe in support of a

723
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,120
goal

724
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,559
maybe you have an experience you want to

725
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,159
write about but you want to fictionalize

726
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,200
it or you just really don't want to

727
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,799
write a memoir

728
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,240
and the one that's probably most

729
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,480
relevant for me in this period harmless

730
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,440
escapism is great i recommend it

731
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,720
especially if it's pretty harmless

732
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,280
here are the only things you need to get

733
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,720
started

734
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,799
you need to want to do this like this is

735
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,720
the very most important thing i can tell

736
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,039
you and it might sound obvious but a lot

737
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,640
of writing advice can get kind of

738
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,000
abstract especially if you're just

739
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,960
starting

740
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,559
but seriously the single most important

741
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,559
thing and what's funny is this is the

742
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,080
same thing i tell people if they tell me

743
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,520
they're thinking about about moving into

744
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,240
tech is you have to like this because

745
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,440
it's going to be really annoying

746
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,039
sometimes and you need a love for what

747
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,720
you're doing to carry you along past the

748
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,400
irritating stuff

749
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
you can figure out the rest later but if

750
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,159
you like the idea of having written a

751
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,600
novel better than the reality of the

752
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,360
work that goes into it you're going to

753
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,919
have a much harder time doing this

754
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,120
and then

755
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,679
you also need the seed of an idea

756
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,200
a scene is enough

757
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,880
a character you want to follow around is

758
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,720
enough you just need a single little

759
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,799
place to start to nourish and wait for

760
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,240
that little sprout to come out and

761
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,200
that's enough to follow

762
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,120
and because i'm talking to kind of a

763
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,039
tech audience let's talk tools it is

764
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,120
important um

765
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,720
how should you write this there are a

766
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,840
lot of different things you can type

767
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,960
into

768
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,480
the best answer is the thing that you

769
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,080
like which maybe is the thing you use

770
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,600
for work that's kind of how i've ended

771
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,440
up with the choices i've made

772
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,200
here are some things you might like

773
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,360
some people like longhand because it

774
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,880
makes it very separate from the rest of

775
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
the things they do

776
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,000
i've done this before

777
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,080
often on public transportation in an era

778
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,760
where i was on that a lot more than i am

779
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,120
now

780
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,480
the advantages of this it's totally

781
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,720
portable it's not dependent on batteries

782
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,120
so it can work uh there's google drive

783
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,559
which i prefer

784
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,279
uh but your phone's notes app also legit

785
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,200
i've known people who use git to really

786
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,720
good effect with this

787
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,440
um microsoft word which uh feels

788
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,120
controversial to recommend anything like

789
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,440
that but it is made for this and it's

790
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,760
still pretty standard in publishing and

791
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,120
writing circles like when i've taken

792
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,480
classes i've gotten

793
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,799
a frankly shocking amount of docx files

794
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,559
to review and you need to be able to

795
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,000
roll with that

796
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,440
if you want to go fancier there's a tool

797
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
called scrivener which

798
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,279
has mind mapping and organizational

799
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,400
stuff so you can do things like move

800
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,600
chapters around really easily

801
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,080
let's talk about first drafts versus

802
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,520
final drafts

803
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,880
a first draft

804
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,400
like i said a way of getting from point

805
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,520
a to point b

806
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,840
also a chance to delight yourself

807
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,279
um it's a place to push boundaries of

808
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,640
the story because logic and

809
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,400
characterization haven't been completely

810
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,520
set yet

811
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,120
it's probably going to have repetition

812
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,720
in it that's totally cool that is a

813
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,400
thing to deal with later not in this

814
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,240
part of the process

815
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,480
and it's an elegant first route that can

816
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,240
still be super fun to write in all of

817
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,760
its mess

818
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,360
a first draft is not a chance at

819
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,640
perfection

820
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,159
that might come later but honestly

821
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,600
probably never and it's best to make

822
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,279
your piece with that

823
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,880
a first draft is not your only chance to

824
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
get this right it is far from it it's

825
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,480
not required to contain everything that

826
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
needs to be there i have stuff i've been

827
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,080
working on for a couple of years and

828
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,600
foundational things still shift around

829
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,880
sometimes

830
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,480
you know it's your world you're the god

831
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,880
of it you can do whatever you need to do

832
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,240
and it's not required to be written

833
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
linearly

834
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,720
some people do

835
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
start with once upon a time go straight

836
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,120
through till the end lots of us don't

837
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,559
it's totally okay to bounce around to

838
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,720
leave placeholders write yourself notes

839
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
i sometimes write my name in all caps in

840
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,799
places so that i can command f and find

841
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,559
where my past self wanted my future self

842
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,360
to pay a little more attention to

843
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,400
in short

844
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,880
a first draft is woven cloth it's not a

845
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,760
dress

846
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,600
it is a pile of clay

847
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,520
it is not a sculpture this is your

848
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,640
permission to go wild

849
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,799
with that let's talk about planning

850
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,200
uh in the writing world i have found

851
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,080
that often um people divide the way the

852
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,360
different ways people plan into plotters

853
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,520
versus pantsers um

854
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,440
the author kat rambo has a great post

855
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,880
about this which i linked in the blog

856
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,480
version of the talk

857
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,760
plotters like to know everywhere the

858
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,120
story is going before they get they

859
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,880
start this still usually leaves some

860
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,159
room for change along the way but they

861
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,840
like to really nail it down often in an

862
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,080
outline before they start writing actual

863
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,960
prose

864
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,159
perfectly valid excellent way to proceed

865
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,240
pantsers however right by the seat of

866
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,279
their pants

867
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,039
they know some things when they start

868
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,960
they know more of them when they're done

869
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,480
and then they proceed

870
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,840
and then some people and this includes

871
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,320
me are kind of a combination of the two

872
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,919
i tend to write out the parts i know

873
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,240
this character the scene the setting get

874
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,000
to like the third or halfway point and

875
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,679
then i go back and make an outline so i

876
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,399
can start using it to navigate because

877
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,159
a lot of words even with command f gets

878
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,120
to be a lot to move around

879
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,640
mostly though just see where you feel

880
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,760
comfortable

881
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
play with both ends of the spectrum

882
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,440
and expect your process to evolve if you

883
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,039
choose to keep up with this because your

884
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,399
skills will change and you're going to

885
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,600
learn more things about yourself

886
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,600
next

887
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,520
this might be the single most important

888
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,279
thing which feels like we're starting to

889
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,120
get into themes for today

890
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,039
you have to have mindfulness to be able

891
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,799
to complete a first draft of a novel

892
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,080
because you need to be able to keep

893
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,520
putting words down

894
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,039
with the knowledge that you are not

895
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,559
perfectly nailing it today and for some

896
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,200
of us this is so hard and it's okay

897
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,679
but nailing it is not today's goal

898
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,240
nailing it is your future self's problem

899
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,080
and unlike a lot of oh good luck future

900
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,679
self kind of things this is a

901
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,880
responsible and self-loving thing to do

902
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,159
there is drafting you and there is

903
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,600
revising you these are two different

904
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,159
jobs and it's cool to separate them

905
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,880
today drafting you is in charge revising

906
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,159
you is going to have different skills

907
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,760
and priorities

908
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,399
because our goal and i quote anne lamott

909
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,440
we want to write a shitty first draft

910
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,279
that's the goal because the great news

911
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,559
is your first draft doesn't have to be

912
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,360
good and odds are by the way we evaluate

913
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
a finished novel it's not going to be

914
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,120
but it's a different thing the goals are

915
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,880
different we're not setting records for

916
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,399
the marathon we're not trying to be

917
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,679
incredibly

918
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,120
beautiful and graceful

919
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
we're just crossing the finish line at

920
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,880
our own pace

921
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,399
because the thing is to do this and do

922
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,240
this effectively and do this without

923
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,840
being sad all the time

924
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,200
you have to make yourself believe your

925
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,120
story you also have to make yourself

926
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,480
believe that this will get better and

927
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,520
the thing is

928
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,600
it totally will you can remind yourself

929
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
that i promised you the work will get

930
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,279
better in time and i mean it if you

931
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,799
choose to keep doing this and you put

932
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,919
the time in

933
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,240
it just will

934
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,840
and the killer is you also start to

935
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,960
learn things about your writing as you

936
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,000
go along

937
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,480
because everyone like every famous

938
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,919
accomplished author whose work you've

939
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,039
ever read

940
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,399
has things that come up in their writing

941
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,760
that if they're left unchecked would be

942
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,399
undesirable in a final draft lucky for

943
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,000
us we are only writing a first draft and

944
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,399
we don't have to fix these things today

945
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,480
you can't ignore them entirely

946
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,559
you can passively note them and be the

947
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,000
stone in the stream letting the water

948
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,320
flow around you

949
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,679
my characters

950
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,760
love to gaze at things pensively before

951
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
finally saying something

952
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,520
i love that for them they can do this as

953
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,399
much as they want in the first draft

954
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,559
and the same is true of themes

955
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,399
that's the higher level like about of a

956
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,559
story a story might be about two people

957
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,559
who go from san francisco to montana on

958
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,200
a road trip that's the plot but the

959
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,120
theme might be discovery of the true

960
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
self or the compromises we make in love

961
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,520
or something about the american dream

962
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,600
themes are a concern of the revising you

963
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,520
in the future you have the option of

964
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,679
totally ignoring it in the first draft

965
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,960
if you want you can watch and get a

966
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,640
sense of what some likely themes are

967
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,840
it's kind of fun because you start to

968
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,360
learn about things that are important to

969
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,200
you that you might not have realized

970
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,480
and then you can put them away until the

971
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,520
time is right just remind yourself

972
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,840
perfection is not required this day only

973
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,199
word count and progress

974
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,039
next let's talk about motivation because

975
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,039
we are talking about what is for a lot

976
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,720
of the process a super solo venture

977
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,880
it's motivation um one of the best ways

978
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,240
i know is to have a place in a time

979
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,080
you're going to do this which goes back

980
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,919
to the the question of routine but the

981
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,360
thing is it helps to not have to do the

982
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,039
work every time of figuring out when and

983
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,600
where you're going to sit and do this

984
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,760
i also recommend bribing yourself

985
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,440
you know it doesn't have to be elaborate

986
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,519
um but if you know that when you get to

987
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,200
the end of the allotted time you wanted

988
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,960
to do this you're going to take a walk

989
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,640
you're going to text a friend you're

990
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,679
going to do something you've been

991
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,200
looking forward to

992
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,399
it's a really good way to start to

993
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,120
establish routine um we're all kind of

994
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,880
toddlers on the inside

995
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,600
it's the same way that you can earn a

996
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,760
really huge salary and free pizza never

997
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,360
stops being an incentive

998
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,600
you can use that to manipulate yourself

999
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,240
and i really recommend doing it

1000
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,519
um there's also the matter of

1001
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,679
accountability which i'll go to in depth

1002
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,519
in a couple of minutes

1003
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,440
i also recommend practicing being really

1004
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,039
nice to yourself

1005
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,200
like when i write a note about a to-do

1006
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,559
and i'm only writing to myself no one

1007
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,080
else will ever see this

1008
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,960
a lot of times i write please

1009
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,279
writing can be punishing be soft where

1010
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,159
you can it really really helps

1011
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,320
and related to bribes also celebrate

1012
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,159
victories and victories can take lots of

1013
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,519
forms you wrote a thousand words you

1014
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,279
wrote seven days in a row

1015
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,080
you

1016
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,840
did so many incremental goals before you

1017
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,200
get to the point of like i did a first

1018
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
draft and all of these goals are worth

1019
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,039
celebrating this is amazing work look

1020
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,360
what you did

1021
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,240
so this gets the question of measuring

1022
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,640
actual work done which you don't need to

1023
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,360
do

1024
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,039
um i like doing it because i need to get

1025
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,559
a feeling of velocity

1026
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,840
you don't have to do this you can sit

1027
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,440
and type when you want to and just be

1028
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,360
very content and that's a marvelous use

1029
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,880
of time

1030
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,640
if you choose to do it though

1031
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,559
this can be very official like i have a

1032
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,799
spreadsheet that i record things in or

1033
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,640
it can be done informally just by taking

1034
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,720
a look at stuff now and then uh command

1035
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,480
shift c in google docs brings up word

1036
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,880
count if you ever want to check it out

1037
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,399
this however can be emotionally

1038
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,080
unhelpful for some people so don't feel

1039
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
like this is how you need to do this if

1040
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,000
you suspect this kind of really specific

1041
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,600
measurement is going to psych you out

1042
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,519
skip it you don't need it

1043
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,880
instead if you still want to track

1044
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,399
something i recommend

1045
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,399
keeping an eye on

1046
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,720
butt and seat hands on keyboard time

1047
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,679
and this doesn't have to mean like

1048
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,519
writing down your minutes instead it can

1049
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,039
just mean that you always sit down for

1050
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,960
your half hour to write after work you

1051
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,200
may write you may not but you created

1052
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,320
the conditions where writing can take

1053
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,559
place and that's victory too

1054
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,559
related uh consider finding routine and

1055
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,559
then feel happy when you stick to it

1056
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,799
i do something called a london writer's

1057
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,120
hour they do four hours most days i do

1058
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,480
the australia one which happens around

1059
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,679
lunch for me

1060
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,440
on those days i get to write without

1061
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
wondering the how or the when

1062
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,480
it's awesome there's no thinking

1063
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,919
involved

1064
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,679
you can set goals for yourself but keep

1065
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,120
them gentle at first

1066
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,799
ambition can come later you know people

1067
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,480
don't start out right on the mountain

1068
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,240
first they maybe do a little indoor

1069
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,480
climbing do the simple wall before

1070
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,240
shelling them challenging themselves

1071
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,279
more and more

1072
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,320
to the long form goal

1073
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,080
right let's talk about accountability

1074
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,519
if you want to do this figure out if you

1075
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,120
do best with accountability to yourself

1076
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,240
or someone else

1077
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,760
for me i do a mix of bullet journaling

1078
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,039
and spreadsheets to keep on top of my

1079
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,440
life and progress on all sorts of things

1080
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,640
it means a lot to me to check certain

1081
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,480
boxes every day so this method works

1082
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,919
well for me but

1083
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,200
you may do better with external

1084
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
accountability in which case you can try

1085
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,719
posting on social media when you've done

1086
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,719
your work for the day you can text a

1087
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,560
friend who has solemnly sworn that they

1088
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,800
will send you back only the biggest

1089
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,960
nicest burst of emojis

1090
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,239
we're reaching out to writing community

1091
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,599
of

1092
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,520
writing is a lonely journey and it's

1093
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,960
nice to have parts of it be less so

1094
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,239
i found a community in this era largely

1095
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,599
through slacks

1096
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,239
clarion west it's a speculative fiction

1097
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,159
writing group and organization outside

1098
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,560
of seattle they did a summer event where

1099
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,000
for six weeks everyone commits to a

1100
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,520
writing goal and their slack was super

1101
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,280
active and really fun

1102
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,960
um but day to day i tend to find the

1103
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,239
dedicated writing channel in the

1104
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,199
different

1105
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,520
text slacks that i'm in

1106
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,359
but there's also twitter which i've used

1107
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,960
and then there are subreddits that are

1108
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,480
super active there's writing there's

1109
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,719
keep writing there's writers there are a

1110
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,640
ton dedicated to all of the different

1111
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,079
genres and subgenres you could think

1112
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,520
about

1113
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,040
when in-person things are a good idea

1114
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,920
again

1115
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,560
i'm going to go to local readings and

1116
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,359
talk to people um i'm going to do my

1117
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,200
first in-person writing class in several

1118
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,400
years

1119
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,839
there's also conferences that are really

1120
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,359
useful for this

1121
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,040
but with classes and conferences there's

1122
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,119
still tons of them being held over zoom

1123
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,400
so it's totally possible to find

1124
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,000
community that way especially if you do

1125
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,920
a class that meets more than once and

1126
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,280
you start to get to know people and get

1127
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,520
a sense of maybe their style complements

1128
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,800
yours and maybe you have something to

1129
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,200
offer each other

1130
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
and this will be important later because

1131
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,800
there will be a point once you've

1132
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,040
written a first draft done a revision of

1133
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,560
a second and a third

1134
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,400
where you realize that you're going to

1135
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,800
need external feedback to be able to

1136
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,320
progress with what you're doing you need

1137
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,160
an actual other person who doesn't live

1138
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,200
in your head

1139
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,800
to look at your story and tell you where

1140
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,880
things are working and maybe not working

1141
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,640
quite in the way you want them to be

1142
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,400
for a lot of people this is the second

1143
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,680
third or fourth draft when you pull in a

1144
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,240
beta reader to take a look at things

1145
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,240
it's a really good idea

1146
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,400
both because writers are lovely people

1147
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,000
and because you can be helpful to each

1148
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,119
other

1149
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,480
to make friends with people who are at a

1150
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,000
similar place in their writing journey

1151
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,920
to you

1152
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,760
it helps you learn together and if maybe

1153
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
you all share some ambitions it lets you

1154
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,640
help each other succeed

1155
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,680
yeah and then after that

1156
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,040
there's just sitting down and doing it

1157
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,599
and figuring out what feels awesome

1158
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,040
it's useful to have an idea of where to

1159
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,640
start and where you're going or i feel

1160
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,320
reassured by it anyway

1161
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,160
but you don't have to

1162
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,440
i recommend

1163
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,720
writing the thing you're most excited

1164
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,839
about first

1165
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:34,880
then figure out the next thing you're

1166
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,880
excited by and keep going

1167
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
there are people who do prefer to write

1168
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,200
just like straight through linearly

1169
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,560
but i find there's some good information

1170
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,079
to be found if you realize that you were

1171
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,839
super psyched to write one part but

1172
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,040
there's another that whenever you think

1173
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,880
about it you're just kind of like oh god

1174
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,160
that

1175
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,079
if you feel that way there's a decent

1176
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,200
chance that your reader might too

1177
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,000
so

1178
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,920
you don't have to obey it immediately

1179
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,119
but it's a really good thing to listen

1180
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,400
to because

1181
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,280
you know what's up too

1182
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,119
so

1183
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,720
all writers share some experiences but

1184
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,800
we're all you know different and weird

1185
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,240
still there are some common problems

1186
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,200
that we bump into as we dig into this

1187
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,040
for instance

1188
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,800
instead of progressing i keep re-reading

1189
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,320
what i've written and trying to optimize

1190
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,240
it and focusing on the same 10 000 words

1191
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,160
instead of moving forward

1192
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,680
i did this for years

1193
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,040
it's really easy to do this especially

1194
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
if you have a job and responsibilities

1195
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,640
and stuff

1196
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,560
what i recommend to get around this is

1197
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,640
to write yourself a note about what you

1198
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,320
want to accomplish the next time you sit

1199
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,760
down so you don't have to rediscover

1200
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,440
this the next time

1201
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,040
then if you need to

1202
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,400
just reread the last couple of

1203
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,079
paragraphs you wrote and then start

1204
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,200
typing

1205
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,720
minimize the reorientation you have to

1206
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,320
do and you'll be less likely to get lost

1207
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,359
in the work

1208
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,200
just leave yourself a little trail

1209
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,240
something to resubmerge yourself and

1210
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,920
it is much easier than to not get lost

1211
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,480
in the weeds

1212
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,000
alright next the common problem um

1213
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,320
you've written some stuff and maybe you

1214
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
kind of hate it and it feels bad to look

1215
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,680
at

1216
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,359
this is totally okay

1217
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,359
this happens to everyone sometimes every

1218
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,520
author you've ever adored every person

1219
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,359
who's written a story that made your

1220
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,440
soul feel recognized

1221
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,200
they write stuff that they look at and

1222
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,480
go

1223
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,640
am i even literate there are just days

1224
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,760
like that there's sometimes strings of

1225
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,680
days like that totally okay

1226
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,000
the more you do this uh

1227
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,440
the more you're going to cringe reading

1228
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,200
your old stuff

1229
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,560
it means you're growing it's actually a

1230
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,320
great sign even if it kind of makes it

1231
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,680
makes your soul want to leave your body

1232
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,119
a little bit

1233
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,680
it's great to have more than one project

1234
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,160
going at a time once you have ideas that

1235
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,839
make sense to be able to invest this

1236
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,119
time in

1237
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,400
and the great thing about this is like

1238
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,079
any kind of investment you want to

1239
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,800
diversify so that no single project

1240
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,119
represents your entire writing success

1241
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,599
at any given moment

1242
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,240
alternatively uh walk away for a while

1243
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,920
it's totally normal and i know this

1244
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,520
comes up in tech too

1245
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,119
just to put things down and not pick

1246
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,640
them up for a little bit um i find

1247
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,480
that's when ideas like to creep in

1248
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,400
my brain likes to answer questions when

1249
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,920
i am walking around my neighborhood

1250
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,680
doing dishes or

1251
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,560
very conveniently falling asleep thanks

1252
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,880
brian

1253
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,800
what about if you've started writing

1254
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,160
something you're investing time in it

1255
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,000
you see the word count growing

1256
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,280
but you still don't know how the thing

1257
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,640
ends this is also super normal

1258
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,800
the good news is you have time to wander

1259
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,680
around

1260
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,839
try meandering with your characters more

1261
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,839
try diving into the middle

1262
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,520
try exploring your world figuring out

1263
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,599
colors and textures and smells how does

1264
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,440
money work how does social status work

1265
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,599
if you need to figure that out

1266
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,200
the end like all the rest is a work in

1267
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,280
progress and it can change hugely

1268
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
between drafts

1269
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,880
that's totally valid it's very normal

1270
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,320
working style

1271
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,200
um

1272
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,880
i also like writing monologues from

1273
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,160
characters if i feel like i'm not

1274
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,359
getting their motivation or i don't know

1275
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,480
what's going on

1276
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,760
just giving them a chance to speak

1277
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,839
without going this is good pros can be

1278
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,160
super useful for unblocking yourself

1279
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,440
usually they'll reveal something to me

1280
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,560
if i just give them space to talk

1281
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,640
and then another problem um maybe you've

1282
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,720
realized actually you just don't like

1283
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,160
this whole thing

1284
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
in that case i say congratulations you

1285
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
tried something you dove into it you

1286
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,000
worked on something new and you were

1287
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,599
honest enough to look at the work put in

1288
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,440
and go this is not how i need to spend

1289
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,480
my time

1290
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,400
you get to choose another hobby you like

1291
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,760
and cheers for trying something new

1292
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,560
so takeaways

1293
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,960
going what now feels like way way back

1294
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,560
uh the command line can do a ton of

1295
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,400
awesome cool stuff and you can do

1296
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,520
awesome things with the information it

1297
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,040
can give you

1298
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,560
if you want to write a first draft novel

1299
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,720
you absolutely can

1300
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,960
and as with so many things

1301
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,839
button seat hands on keyboard

1302
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,000
you can do it

1303
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,200
furthermore

1304
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,640
cheetah believes you can do it she is

1305
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,160
sitting right by my foot right now i

1306
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,839
think i just touched her belly

1307
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:58,960
um

1308
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,359
susie believes you can do it

1309
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,920
and so do i

1310
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,480
thank you very much

1311
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,000
thank you and um there's a couple

1312
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,560
questions in the slack actually um

1313
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,640
one of them is how do you define the

1314
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,640
line between creative writing and

1315
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,400
writing for a more technical audience so

1316
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,079
the difference between technical and

1317
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,319
creative writing

1318
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,240
yeah um

1319
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,520
i would say

1320
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,599
when it's creative writing i'm trying to

1321
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,839
tell a story often kind of with the goal

1322
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,560
of making someone feel you know it can

1323
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,000
be i love this character but i just i

1324
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,520
want them to feel something and have an

1325
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,040
experience related

1326
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,640
whereas technical writing i want them to

1327
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,000
come out knowing how to do something

1328
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,880
really specific um if i get bullets in

1329
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,359
