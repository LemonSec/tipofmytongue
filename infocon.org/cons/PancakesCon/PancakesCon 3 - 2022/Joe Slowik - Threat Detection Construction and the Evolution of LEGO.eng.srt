1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,839
and joe is going to tell us about threat

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,559
detection construction and also the

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,960
evolution of lego i know a lot of people

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,200
are really excited for this talk so

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,960
thank you for being here joe we're

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,239
really really grateful that you're here

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,400
to share your knowledge and your hobby

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,480
of legos with us today

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,850
um

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,279
[Music]

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,439
uh oh joe you're you're not coming

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,039
through on sound

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,039
hold on here we go

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,439
that sounds better yes there we go all

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,520
right awesome right and let's get slides

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,480
up as well shall we

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,879
okay looks like we're good to go

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,640
looks good all right well hey thank you

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,160
so much for the introduction leslie it's

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,559
a pleasure to be a part of this event i

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,719
mean it's a star-studded cast between

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,879
yourself having l kick things off this

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,280
morning and then a number of

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
uh really awesome talks throughout the

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,600
day so really privileged to be here but

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,960
enough of that because everyone knows

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,879
how awesome this is and how privileged

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,640
it is to be here let's talk about threat

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,479
detection and the evolution of lego so

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,479
first

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,760
first

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,560
ah so hello who am i so my name is joe

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,080
sloick uh currently my day job is

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,520
leading threat intelligence and

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,240
detections engineering at gigamon so

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,240
focused on the network side of things i

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,080
also do cyber threat intelligence and

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,600
threat modeling training through a

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
company i founded called paralysis so

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,439
that's kind of the banner under which

41
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,840
i'm doing this since it is a weekend uh

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,759
previously leslie and i actually had the

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,680
opportunity to work together uh when i

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,920
was at dragos she still or they still

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,439
are i am

46
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,880
obviously have moved on but i've also

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,320
done cyber threat intelligence in a

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,360
variety of other uh ecosystems ranging

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,759
to domain tools as well as doing work in

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,759
the incident response realm at los

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,159
alamos national laboratory and

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,439
various things in the u.s military once

53
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,640
upon a time

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,399
but enough about me the main reason

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,680
we're here today is to talk about

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,240
detections as well as to talk about lego

57
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
so what does that mean well first our

58
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,159
agenda for today we'll talk about what

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,639
detections actually are what they mean

60
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,560
and then get into a bit of detection

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,800
construction and contextuality that'll

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,680
build up into a theory of threat

63
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,319
detection and then we're going to take a

64
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,800
sharp left turn and go into something

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,120
that i adore and in fact you may pick

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,440
out a couple of items behind me uh in

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,840
terms of lego uh

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,160
we'll talk about the evolution of lego

69
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,959
as a system as a construct as a toy if

70
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,519
you wanted to be dismissive i suppose

71
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,519
of what that looks like going from

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,360
really not just the 80s but you know

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,000
back to the early 20th century almost

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
but use that as a pivot point to talk

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,120
about how we can start achieving

76
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,440
complexity through better engineering

77
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,519
and better understanding of just what it

78
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,040
is that we're dealing with and the

79
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
component pieces of what it is that we

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,560
are working with at any given point in

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,599
time

82
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,680
so first detection

83
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,519
i often like including definitions when

84
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,680
i start talking about things because it

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,319
helps level set a common understanding

86
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,239
of what it is we're discussing so saying

87
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,319
something like oh detections i know what

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,239
that is like well do you really so we

89
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,879
can look at detections as being some way

90
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,480
of developing and implementing

91
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,319
appropriate activities to identify the

92
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,720
occurrence of a cyber security event

93
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,280
that boring definition is brought to you

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,879
courtesy of nist

95
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,400
it works

96
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,920
well enough uh but at least

97
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
conceptualizes this idea that we're

98
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,879
looking for

99
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,920
some

100
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,400
identifiable item

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
that leads to a

102
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,519
warning or a

103
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,440
other alert that draws our attention to

104
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,680
a given matter typically with a security

105
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,959
focus to it

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,959
now the problem is is that you know

107
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,200
there's detection or there's

108
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,280
training around information security

109
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,080
around red teaming around forensics

110
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,200
around

111
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,439
uh cyber threat intelligence around

112
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,680
industrial control systems you start

113
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,439
looking for something that's

114
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,200
focused on threat detection and

115
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,560
detection development there's really not

116
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,239
a whole lot out there they're certainly

117
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,840
training towards different tools that

118
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,000
could be used for threat detection like

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,319
if you want to write zeek modules or you

120
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,319
want to write cerakata rules or you want

121
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,840
to develop yara

122
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,478
or other items but very little into

123
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,320
discussion of just how does this work

124
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
out in practice and what is an

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,560
all-encompassing theory of threatened

126
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,880
of threat detection that we can apply to

127
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,880
our organizations of course i say this

128
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,520
and sans 525 or whatever will come out

129
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,759
or next week or something on detection

130
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,840
development or something but for now we

131
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,320
have a market gap so to speak and it's a

132
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,680
pretty important one because when we

133
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,120
think about what drives a lot of our

134
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,000
security programs it's the sock or

135
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,720
incident responders responding to a

136
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,040
detection that fires in the environment

137
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,720
and so in practice what we typically

138
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,919
have and i think this is one of the

139
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,680
problems that we have in terms of

140
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,440
detection training

141
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,080
is things are typically very vendor or

142
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,160
very product focused so you have a

143
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,160
splunk you have a qradar you have an

144
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,759
arcsight i'm sorry

145
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,800
um you have an edr product or an ndr

146
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,639
product or whatever and you're operating

147
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,560
with all the confines of that given

148
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
solution and then trying to identify

149
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,199
different ways of setting up

150
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,520
uh queries for

151
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,479
uh

152
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,320
identifying things of interest or things

153
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,639
that are suspicious and that's all well

154
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,479
and good but the thing is we have to ask

155
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,520
ourselves just how

156
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,000
useful how accurate and how sustainable

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,320
that methodology might be because we

158
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,600
start looking at detections and

159
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,120
operations from a very typical

160
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,360
perspective we

161
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,680
usually operate from the perspective of

162
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,880
flagging something bad like if view this

163
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,080
ip address then we wait for it to appear

164
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,639
like oh i have network traffic to this

165
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,360
atomic indicator or some other item and

166
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,280
then we do something about it

167
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,960
the problem is is that a lot of these

168
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
steps are

169
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,440
if not ill-defined well ill-defined

170
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,600
would be kind of kind of beneficial

171
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,440
typically they're not defined at all

172
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,639
that we

173
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,440
develop or practitioners develop some

174
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,759
saved search criteria or saved alerting

175
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,280
criteria around a situation of interest

176
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
but then there's no real background

177
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,600
information for why that situation is

178
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,319
interesting let alone harmful and in

179
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,960
passively waiting for it to appear we

180
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,240
see a lot of initiative uh to our

181
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,919
adversaries to

182
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,759
take part in other operations before

183
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,160
that single item of interest pops up and

184
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,720
then as far as doing something we're

185
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
typically from a detection development

186
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,080
perspective just throwing things over

187
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,800
the defense from over the fence from

188
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,560
detections development to security

189
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,639
operations saying hey

190
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,280
something bad happened go figure it out

191
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,479
and that all seems a little sub-optimal

192
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,319
because if we start looking at how this

193
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,759
functions in practice the typical

194
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,759
detection workflow leaves an awful lot

195
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,199
to be desired

196
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,880
so if we look at this from again that

197
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,039
perspective of identifying activity of

198
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,000
interest

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,400
creating some saved or persistent query

200
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,479
that's looking for that activity

201
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,319
typically in the form of an atomic

202
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,560
indicator like an ip address a hash

203
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,360
value a domain name maybe a registry key

204
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
or something else and then providing a

205
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,199
notification when that activity is

206
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,120
observed typically with some time lag

207
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,280
involved as well we start seeing a

208
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,039
number of problems emerge in that sort

209
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,960
of uh

210
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,919
problem or construct for one when we're

211
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,680
identifying activity of interest we're

212
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,360
really looking at something that is

213
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,680
fundamentally backward focused so if i'm

214
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,240
focusing on a given ip or for example

215
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,759
something that i'm sure the cti twitter

216
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,919
mafia has been squealing about the last

217
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,560
24 hours or so is oh my goodness there

218
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
was a wiper attack in ukraine or

219
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,120
whatever what do we do about this well

220
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,680
one of the calls is like oh we need

221
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,599
hash values or other items or whatever

222
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,919
to look for this that's cool

223
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,000
but obviously start looking at atomic

224
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,599
indicators and other items is that we're

225
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,919
typically chasing the last breach as

226
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,680
opposed to focusing on the fundamentals

227
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,840
of how adversaries operated to try to

228
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,000
capture future activity we could talk

229
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,720
about indicators for an hour beyond this

230
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,080
and i don't want to make this a

231
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,759
discussion focused on that but as a

232
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,280
starting point it really sets us up for

233
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,759
a

234
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,000
non-ideal way of responding to threats

235
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
but then as we start getting you know

236
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
further along this process in creating a

237
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,160
saved query looking for these sorts of

238
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,400
observables we get into the problem that

239
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
behaviors can be modified changed or

240
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,640
specifically developed in order to evade

241
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,519
detections so for the log4j scenario

242
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,039
that everyone had to deal with as we got

243
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,000
changed from 2021 to 2022

244
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,480
there was a new proof of concept or a

245
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,720
new implementation of the log4j

246
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,480
exploitation string popping up on

247
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,640
twitter at least every couple of hours

248
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,320
from some red teamer or offset

249
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,399
researcher if you were trying to chase

250
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,640
down every single implementation of

251
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,360
fuzzing the log4j exploitation string

252
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,040
leaving aside that you can just encrypt

253
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,560
it in tls or whatever and you're not

254
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
going to see it to begin with

255
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,399
you're fighting a losing battle as there

256
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,839
are simply too many ways for the

257
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,519
adversary to try to circumvent uh

258
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,200
those sorts of detections in order to

259
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,320
try to gain uh desirable levels of

260
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
execution or ways of implementing that

261
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,080
particular activity

262
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,600
and then finally

263
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,000
when we even if we succeed in all these

264
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,920
items that we've identified a piece of

265
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,160
infrastructure or a static behavioral

266
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,240
pattern uh and alerting on it for the

267
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,399
given adversary as we get into the

268
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,640
notification part of things like oh i

269
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,920
have a splunk alert that fired like

270
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,360
here's an email

271
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,120
that contains the query string and the

272
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,040
results from it like okay if i'm a stock

273
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,959
analyst what do i do i'm a tier one

274
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,040
responder what are my next steps if i'm

275
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,720
a tier two or tier three responder

276
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
getting up into the incident response

277
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,440
process

278
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,800
what are the artifacts that i need to

279
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,120
prioritize what is the context around a

280
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,320
given

281
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,880
element that i need to use in order to

282
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,959
really respond to things and so we take

283
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,720
this assumption that oh detections

284
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,200
that's just kind of where

285
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,800
security just kind of falls together

286
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
between disciplines of stock

287
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,480
investigations incident response

288
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,800
forensics cyber threat intelligence we

289
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,160
don't spend enough time thinking about

290
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,440
well how do we actually make this

291
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,680
workflow into something that is both

292
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,839
valuable as well as sustainable from a

293
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,240
defense and defense of operations

294
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,519
perspective

295
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,360
so as we start taking a step back from

296
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
the state of what currently is at least

297
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,200
for most organizations to where we would

298
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,320
like to be

299
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
what we want from a detection

300
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,680
perspective are

301
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,519
items that are flexible enough in order

302
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,519
to keep pace with our adversaries so we

303
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,959
don't want something that is looking at

304
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,720
last week's breach but rather looking at

305
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,160
a fundamental way of adversary

306
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,640
operations that we can continue tracking

307
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,959
and responding to moving forward we want

308
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,240
to make sure that whatever it is we're

309
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,120
developing is firm enough to avoid noise

310
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,560
we'll get into the nuance on this in

311
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,920
just a minute here

312
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,000
uh so that we don't overburden our

313
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,720
responders with lots of ephemeral or

314
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,320
plain useless sort of items that they

315
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,480
have to chase down but as part of that

316
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,920
process we also want things to be

317
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,320
contextual enough in some fashion that

318
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,560
it can inform how we disposition these

319
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,959
items when they come across so that

320
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,920
timmy sitting in his

321
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,959
sock position or whatever is not left in

322
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,640
the position where he or she or they are

323
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,880
completely blind as far as what their

324
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,959
next steps are but rather they have

325
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,360
some idea of like oh this falls in this

326
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,440
part of the kill chain or this relates

327
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,120
to this sort of adversary or this sort

328
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,360
of set of adversary behaviors therefore

329
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
i should prioritize these data sources

330
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,600
or i should expedite research and

331
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,079
evidence retrieval from these ephemeral

332
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,600
sources in order to successfully

333
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,920
prosecute a given investigation so

334
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,760
diving into these in specific what is it

335
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
exactly that we're talking about here

336
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
well first off and this is a bias in my

337
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,360
end because i am a

338
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,720
sort of a cyber threat intelligence

339
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,399
practitioner i guess i make fun of it

340
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,240
all the time on twitter so i'm sorry if

341
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,920
you've been offended by that but you

342
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,399
know we have to be a little

343
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,720
humble i think in our discipline but

344
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,200
having said that having an understanding

345
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
of adversary behaviors and adversary

346
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,600
operations is pretty vital in developing

347
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,240
a sustainable detections uh process

348
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,360
because

349
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,440
in tracking adversary operations it's

350
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,120
not just about performing some like

351
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,760
pokemon collection gather all the ioc's

352
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,000
endeavor but rather trying to understand

353
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,320
fundamental adversary behaviors so if

354
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,800
i'm looking at something like log4j

355
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,560
what is it that adversaries are actually

356
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,120
using or leveraging this exploit for

357
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,040
dropping cryptominers installing web

358
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,600
shells going after vcenter instances

359
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,920
understanding the context around how the

360
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,240
given technique is used and then trying

361
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,519
to then build detections to reflect how

362
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,040
adversaries are evolving and what

363
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,680
adversaries are trying to achieve as

364
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,600
part of that operation

365
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,320
so

366
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,600
looking at this from an intelligence

367
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,680
perspective like yes you can yield out

368
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,760
ips and domains and hash values all day

369
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,000
long that's fine but if we're trying to

370
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,680
add actual value when building a

371
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,200
sustainable detection development

372
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,360
practice what we want to do is try to

373
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,760
identify what are those persistent items

374
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,240
related to adversary operations that we

375
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
could look for observables uh

376
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,680
on and then incorporate that into our

377
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,200
security tooling and our existing

378
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,079
visibility in order to catch those items

379
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,920
that's all well and good but we have a

380
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,000
problem that we have to address as part

381
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,279
of this process

382
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,600
namely the issue of false positives but

383
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,279
also false negatives which rarely gets

384
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,959
talked about because that's a really

385
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,079
troubling subject when you start

386
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,079
thinking about it in detail so false

387
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,120
positives we always talk about in

388
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,279
uh context of security operations that

389
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,760
oh false positives suck they burn out

390
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,839
the sock we don't want to do these sorts

391
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,240
of things uh because we're alerting on

392
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,519
benign or non-malicious activity and

393
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,279
spending resources and running these

394
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,000
sorts of things down and that results in

395
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,920
frustration the sock doesn't like you

396
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160
they spit in your coffee they get burned

397
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,920
out you know we don't want to live in

398
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,760
that area and so there's always this

399
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,199
conception that we want to minimize

400
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,880
false positives as part of the detection

401
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,120
development process but it's important

402
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,720
to note that this is a double-edged

403
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,480
sword but certainly false positives are

404
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,399
one thing that we want to avoid but in

405
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,000
doing so we have to be mindful of what

406
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,920
it is that we're missing because a false

407
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,959
negative

408
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,560
type one type two errors if you want to

409
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,480
be very statistical about this is that

410
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,720
we get into false negatives as

411
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,040
uh the dog that didn't bark missing

412
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,199
activity that actually took place and

413
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,720
that results in an intrusion that we

414
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,399
didn't catch and that's really bad

415
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,839
that's where well maybe we don't lose

416
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,160
our jobs maybe the cisso does as a

417
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,320
result of something that takes place so

418
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,480
trying to figure out a way of balancing

419
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,160
these two perspectives and trying to

420
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,760
make sure that we're avoiding false

421
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,600
negatives because we don't want bad

422
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,199
stuff to take place that we completely

423
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,199
miss but at the same time we also don't

424
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,360
want to overburden limited security of

425
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,560
resources

426
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,600
to such an extent by having things

427
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,320
so broad or so all-encompassing that

428
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,000
it's simply impossible to keep up with

429
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,760
it so from a detection development

430
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,360
perspective we need to try to figure out

431
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,560
what the sweet spot is for our

432
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,480
organization we'll get to that in just a

433
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
second because before we get to that i'd

434
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,440
also like to talk about this

435
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,560
contextuality problem that we talk about

436
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,800
threat detections threat engineering

437
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,880
that oh we just don't want to throw over

438
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,959
a detection over the fence and then say

439
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,040
be done with it instead we want to try

440
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,680
to provide some degree of context some

441
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,920
background as to why something took

442
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,000
place why it might be important and what

443
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,720
is involved around a given item that

444
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,959
means if we have a security alert we

445
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,639
don't just provide

446
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,320
here's the alert string and here is the

447
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,440
event data

448
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,320
fetch

449
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,519
but rather we give the analyst something

450
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,120
to cling on to something to

451
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720
initiate their

452
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,079
process of

453
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,920
dispositioning and clearing the given

454
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,360
event in question whether that's your

455
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,519
tier one stock operator or your really

456
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,440
expensive

457
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,040
ir retainer that comes in after

458
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,440
something really bad happens now one way

459
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,079
of approaching this is through playbooks

460
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,560
that is a very popular item in industry

461
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
right now in that we can start

462
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,079
prescribing specific steps and

463
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,639
procedures around a detection so say

464
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,880
detection fires within a management

465
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,240
console or within the uh product

466
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,759
space or whatever it's like oh and

467
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,399
here's a ticket that links or a link

468
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,040
that uh translates over into the wiki uh

469
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,480
here are the concrete steps that you

470
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
need to take in order to

471
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,759
correctly clear this alert that's cool

472
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,079
but we have to be mindful of the

473
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,920
very real possibility that in

474
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,680
establishing playbooks we can be too

475
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,800
rigid that a playbook if it is followed

476
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,040
from true beginning to end and end is

477
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,399
viewed as being

478
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,720
uh successful or complete on its own

479
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,639
that we may have missed something so

480
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,079
certainly providing some degree of

481
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,519
guidance is quite valuable but making

482
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,279
sure that we're not setting things up as

483
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,480
being too rigid or without the

484
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,880
flexibility for analysts to explore

485
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,000
things that are beyond what we

486
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
anticipated

487
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,480
is pretty desirable so i always look at

488
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,000
having something not so much as a

489
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,079
playbook but rather as guidance that if

490
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,600
something comes up as part of a

491
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,760
detection firing within our environment

492
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,039
that a

493
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,559
detection engineer

494
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,039
should put themselves in the position of

495
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,839
the responding analyst and try to uh

496
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,439
think about well what are the steps that

497
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,919
i need to take in order to appropriately

498
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,880
enrich and begin investigating this item

499
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
and for one to try to include those

500
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,480
within the development of the detection

501
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,640
as much as possible which could lead to

502
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,480
some expensive queries and pipes and

503
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
whatnot depending upon what sort of

504
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,840
system that you're working with or if

505
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,440
you're working in a more robust data

506
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,679
solution trying to nest queries in such

507
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,919
a way in order to build a more composite

508
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,919
or compound alerting

509
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,320
but uh really just trying to identify

510
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,640
what are the minimum necessary steps in

511
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,799
order to start addressing the issue but

512
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,799
not the steps that are simply required

513
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,760
in order to close it out it's a really

514
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,919
tough sort of position to be in because

515
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,480
we want to lead our personnel towards

516
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,320
success while at the same time not

517
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
stifling potential creativity or

518
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,559
response to events that would allow us

519
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,640
to try to identify instances where

520
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,760
things go a bit off of the uh

521
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,840
identified road map or

522
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,400
expected adversary activity so that

523
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,280
leads us into a continuum

524
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,440
of operations that a lot of the things

525
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,799
that i've talked about so far and this

526
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,200
is a very high level discussion

527
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,280
of threat detection development uh

528
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,720
really meant to try and give everyone a

529
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,320
background into just what sort of things

530
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,640
we need to be keeping in mind as part of

531
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,520
this process in securing an organization

532
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,840
that we get into this

533
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,919
balance you know try to bring balance to

534
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,320
the force between eliminating false

535
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,480
positives by only alerting unknown bad

536
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,640
items and keeping matters very rigid and

537
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,559
very predictable in terms of our

538
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,799
response and subsequent procedures

539
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,280
or eliminating false negatives by

540
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,080
alerting on all suspicious behavior and

541
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,600
pretty much giving our analysts

542
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,240
completely free reign to take them their

543
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,440
investigations wherever they may lead

544
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,120
there is something we said for either of

545
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,400
these two polls of this continuum but

546
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,160
for most organizations well really for

547
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,480
all organizations we're going to fall

548
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,799
somewhere in between because resources

549
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,520
are finite visibility is limited we

550
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,160
can't simply go down the rabbit hole for

551
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,960
every

552
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,280
suspicious network traffic activity item

553
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,200
that comes across the wire so from a

554
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
detection development perspective we

555
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,880
need to have an understanding of both

556
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,080
what our resources are what capabilities

557
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,200
we have available to us from both a

558
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,880
visibility as well as an investigative

559
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,039
standpoint as well as the risk profile

560
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,880
of the organization in question in order

561
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,039
to figure out what is the tolerance

562
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,120
level for a false negative or something

563
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,559
that we don't catch

564
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,160
given the potential cost and false

565
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,760
positives and what that means for the

566
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,960
use of resources in our environment

567
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,240
so if we start

568
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
applying this to a theory of threat

569
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,559
detection we start getting some idea of

570
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,400
what it is that we want to try to strive

571
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,760
for from a defensive standpoint we want

572
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,600
something that's threat informed that we

573
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,520
understand what adversaries are doing

574
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,480
and we're

575
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,480
shaping how it is we respond to events

576
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,799
in such a fashion that it is aligned

577
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,039
with what is going on out in the wild

578
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,679
and in doing so focusing on what are the

579
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,840
actual behaviors adversaries are using

580
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,320
as opposed to playing whack-a-mole on

581
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,799
various hashes related to a compiled

582
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,480
version of mimikatz or something

583
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,799
similarly useless that means that we're

584
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,799
being not too specific in what it is

585
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,080
that we're looking for

586
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,400
building some degree of flexibility into

587
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,720
matters as well as making sure that

588
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,039
notifications as they're provided

589
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,280
contain some degree of context and then

590
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,520
getting into the balancing act between

591
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,880
our false positive toleration and false

592
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,840
negative

593
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,720
desire or what it is we can take as an

594
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,640
organization before something truly bad

595
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,280
happens and begin putting the defended

596
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,520
organization at risk so really it's by

597
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,760
taking all of these concepts ranging

598
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,520
from cyber threat intelligence to

599
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,480
understand adversary activity to a very

600
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,600
operationally centric view of security

601
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,760
at a given organization to understand

602
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,640
visibility resources capabilities and

603
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,480
how to then define

604
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,799
what it is around a given item that we

605
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,799
observe in our environment that allows

606
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,600
us to then pursue or flag something for

607
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,840
further review by a human in the loop as

608
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,400
part of this entire process

609
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,320
so if we're looking for ideals we want

610
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,559
an understanding of tradecraft to yield

611
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,799
observables the initial

612
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,880
feedstock into the entire security

613
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,120
alerting process but that understanding

614
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,559
of observables is going to yield

615
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,080
detection logic that i'm not just

616
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,240
chasing the sighting of a specific ip

617
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,400
maybe not even the sighting of an asn or

618
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,919
something more general but rather

619
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,760
looking at a series of technical

620
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,679
observations that align with an

621
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,360
adversary behavior we'll look at an

622
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,039
example towards the end today so if

623
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,000
you're wondering like what does this

624
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,960
look like trust me we will get there

625
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,799
but as part of all of this an

626
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,360
understanding of why something is

627
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,440
important what it means how it aligns

628
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,080
with adversary activity should enable

629
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
some guidance some direction to the

630
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,880
response process so that whoever is

631
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,280
responding after hours or sitting third

632
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,360
shift in the sock or whatever isn't

633
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,960
completely left to their own devices

634
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,120
when something bad happens but has

635
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,440
something they can lean on can take

636
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,200
advantage of the knowledge already

637
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,960
gained through the process of developing

638
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,039
and deploying a detection in order to

639
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,520
then prosecute and evaluate that item to

640
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,960
make sure that the organization can

641
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,760
retain some or restore

642
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,720
its secure security posture so that's

643
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,200
all really cool and stuff right

644
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,960
now we will talk about something

645
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,640
completely different and i think this

646
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,000
has come up a couple of times in this

647
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,760
present in this conference so i'm not

648
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,440
being very unique or funny here but at

649
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,960
least i have the gif right

650
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,039
anyway lego

651
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,200
so i'm a loser uh i don't have very many

652
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,039
hobbies i read lots of books uh

653
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,320
otherwise i do security stuff a lot but

654
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
one thing i do carve out time for are

655
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,520
building lego i've been doing this for

656
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,039
i'm not going to say how long because i

657
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,360
don't want to tell you how old i am but

658
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,679
uh lego is something that i've been

659
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,679
doing for quite a long time and it

660
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,280
brings a lot of enjoyment whether that's

661
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,520
following the kit instructions or just

662
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,919
sort of freelancing and

663
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,000
having fun with what is possible with

664
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
the pieces in front of me and so you can

665
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,840
see this through a variety of examples

666
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,000
whether it's my

667
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,880
significant collection of star wars lego

668
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,559
items like the bonsai tree which was a

669
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,880
lot of fun to build but also you'll see

670
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,039
a picture that leslie may be familiar

671
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,840
with from the drago's office of the lego

672
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,600
test range that we had there which was

673
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,200
something that was very near and dear to

674
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,640
my heart while i was working there uh

675
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,279
not pictured here like i bought the lego

676
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,840
8080 the ultimate collector series

677
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,679
set just a few weeks ago

678
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,559
i've

679
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,000
spent an inordinate amount of money on

680
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,360
these sorts of things but it brings

681
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,520
enjoyment and it's cool but as part of

682
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,919
this entire obsession it's helpful to

683
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,600
have an understanding of where lego came

684
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,760
from and what it really means and so if

685
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,600
we look at lego in its origins you know

686
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,400
it all started with well a duck

687
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,320
which is kind of

688
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,679
hilarious on a number of ways it's

689
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,200
neither fuzzy nor snuggly but it is a

690
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,000
duck

691
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,679
and in looking at the history of lego

692
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,799
lego was a idea

693
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,720
formed by craftsman in denmark to really

694
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,840
go play like leglot uh if you were

695
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,440
speaking in

696
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,960
danish

697
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,720
and whatnot so

698
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,120
there's a number of cool things around

699
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,039
how the company is developed over time

700
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,880
in terms of trying to

701
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,000
articulate

702
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,400
a what we would now call stem focused

703
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,120
way of education and learning as well as

704
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,559
play and beginning with wooden toys and

705
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,240
then getting into

706
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,679
the bricks that we all know and love

707
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,919
today so in looking at the bricks though

708
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,520
we can start seeing something stand out

709
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,320
about these items so if we look at lego

710
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,960
back in the original sort of sense

711
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,640
around when the toy developed we had

712
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,360
very blocky sort of designs things that

713
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,480
were built in a very additive fashion um

714
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,159
without very much use of space or uh the

715
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,480
ability to really get very complex

716
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,559
around how designs were put together

717
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,080
because things were built by stacking

718
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,919
bricks on top of one another if you go

719
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,240
to the lego museum in billand which i

720
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,320
had the opportunity to go to uh just

721
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,159
late last year which was really cool

722
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,080
you'll see that it was a big deal when

723
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,000
lego introduced the wheel as part of

724
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,120
their sets so it's very much a

725
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,760
block oriented construction design

726
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,960
until you get to the last 20 years or so

727
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,279
where lego as we view it today

728
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,679
now becomes less of a exercise than just

729
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,919
stacking one brick on top of another but

730
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,159
instead one of building out skeletons of

731
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,080
designs and then hanging

732
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,120
external

733
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,039
pieces off of them to make really

734
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,679
complex structures for example the lego

735
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,840
ultimate collector series star destroyer

736
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,760
which i bought and built and it took a

737
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,039
couple of weeks in order to put that

738
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,279
together you can see it

739
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,640
on the floor and

740
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,279
where i live or whatever in one phase of

741
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,440
construction but the result that you get

742
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,320
is a really complex object at the end

743
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
that would be damn near impossible to

744
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,480
try and construct if you were doing this

745
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,640
through a very typical additive block on

746
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,799
block structure instead what we're doing

747
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,960
is building a skeletal framework

748
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,400
understanding how that framework can

749
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,919
support different elements and then

750
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:28,960
hanging

751
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,559
different elements on it in order to

752
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,559
build a more complex design

753
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,559
so what the hell does that mean

754
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,559
well this gets us into a concept and

755
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,240
maybe this is getting a little off track

756
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,000
here but i think it's important of

757
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,679
transitions in engineering where we

758
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,720
could look at something like the

759
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,640
pyramids which certainly are very

760
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,360
complex and are a marvel of human

761
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,720
ingenuity

762
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,200
and creativity but still we're talking

763
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,039
about lumping really big blocks one on

764
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,039
top of one another and that's pretty

765
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,720
much how structures were built for a

766
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,080
long time we could throw columns of

767
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,400
different sorts and whatnot in there but

768
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,520
it wasn't really until we got to the

769
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,760
19th century where we started seeing the

770
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,960
emergence of the skyscraper uh

771
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,559
so looking at you know the development

772
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,400
of the chicago skyline for example of

773
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,039
seeing the use of materials like steel

774
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,799
and other items in order to develop

775
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,399
lighter structures that were capable of

776
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,080
going higher and

777
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,559
allowing for the increased availability

778
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,520
of space in terms of design and we see

779
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,840
that as we stretch from something like a

780
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,320
19th century building on

781
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,799
state street in chicago and getting into

782
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,399
some of the fantastic buildings that we

783
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,640
can see today where we have central

784
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,200
cores or pillars around which we hang

785
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
things like glass

786
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,120
walls or uh

787
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,200
glass curtains serving as the structure

788
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,880
of a skyscraper

789
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,360
okay that's really cool joe you know a

790
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,640
little bit of architecture or just

791
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,799
enough to be dangerous and bss for a

792
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,240
little bit what's this have to do with

793
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,640
lego or anything else well what it means

794
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,159
is that from a results perspective you

795
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,240
can start getting very complex very

796
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,200
interesting designs such as these items

797
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,799
actually this is from the lego house

798
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,240
also in balloon which i was able to

799
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,840
visit in november this past year and

800
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,120
things like the lego dinosaurs or the

801
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,200
tree of knowledge uh or tree of

802
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,279
creativity rather that's sitting at the

803
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,559
center of the staircase at the lego

804
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,120
house structure you can't build those

805
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,039
just by doing brick on brick on brick

806
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,640
but rather need to start articulating

807
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,320
what is the fundamental structure and

808
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,399
the baseline around which

809
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,000
i am trying to reach my end goal of some

810
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,120
form some design whether that be a

811
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,120
very interesting looking dinosaur a

812
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
massive tree with different villages and

813
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,960
whatnot on each branch

814
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,559
or even getting into things like a star

815
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,240
destroyer or the death star if you're

816
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,480
into star wars lego like i am

817
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,399
and it's understanding how these things

818
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,640
come together through both pre-planning

819
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,159
and understanding the underpinnings

820
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,159
behind these things that we can start

821
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,120
getting to a point where

822
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,640
not just complex but also more

823
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,240
interesting and more complete designs

824
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,919
become possible

825
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,520
that's why when you see things like you

826
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,159
know the really interesting lego

827
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,720
constructions from tv shows or in

828
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,360
youtube videos or or whatnot is that you

829
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,120
really do have this idea of a skeletal

830
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,039
like just structure behind how these

831
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,039
things are put together in order to make

832
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,480
sure that you're not

833
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,240
for one not building something that is

834
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,600
completely untenable because of the

835
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,840
number of pieces required but also that

836
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,840
allows for the efficient use of space

837
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,520
material and

838
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,200
reflection and design to come up with

839
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,279
something at the end that is very

840
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,120
visually pleasing like the three

841
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,679
dinosaurs at the lego house

842
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,440
so what did we learn here

843
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,919
well we learned that firm foundations

844
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,600
and a sound base are pretty much

845
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
necessary if you want to start building

846
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,799
a structure

847
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,880
so if we look back at the lego star

848
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,799
destroyer model that i flashed up a

849
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,200
little bit ago we're talking about a

850
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,279
central spine with a couple of spokes

851
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,679
off of it around which other pieces will

852
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,360
hang and that gets us to those

853
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,200
intermediate structures that enable us

854
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,320
to then start trying to create a more

855
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,480
complex design around that centralized

856
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,600
core that then yield things like the two

857
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,840
shield generator towels little bubbles

858
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,840
or balls or whatever on top of the

859
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,640
bridge section of the star destroyer or

860
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,360
looking at things like a

861
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,520
daily beacon building if you're into the

862
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,760
marvel series of legos where it's not a

863
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,399
solid structure but rather it has rooms

864
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,440
and such and so it can be very uh both

865
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,520
light in structure as well as useful

866
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,600
transportable playable

867
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,919
in form and allowing us to express more

868
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,720
complex ideas than what we would get

869
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,240
just by doing a fairly blocky uh brick

870
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,279
on brick no sort of space in between

871
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,799
structure so

872
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,240
okay that's cool uh i did my two parts

873
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,559
already but the thing is is that wait

874
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,840
there's more

875
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,080
because this relates to infosec and it

876
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,880
relates to detection development because

877
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,880
if we can start constructing a base

878
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,240
understanding of how it is that

879
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,399
adversaries operate

880
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,559
what adversaries need to do in order to

881
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,678
get credential

882
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,440
reuse and gather credentials to achieve

883
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,679
lateral movement to gain

884
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,720
privsec

885
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,399
privilege escalation within an

886
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,240
environment while understanding those

887
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,480
fundamental adversary needs and desires

888
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,240
and then translating those behaviors

889
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,159
into the visible observables related to

890
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,440
them

891
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,240
tracking uh trying to dump lsas memory

892
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,880
or trying to uh brute force credentials

893
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,399
within an environment and how that's

894
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,159
manifest within logs or different

895
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,320
security products that gives us the

896
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
capability and the opportunity to start

897
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,799
building lot detection logic around

898
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,200
those observables with the contextuality

899
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,679
of why that sort of activity matters so

900
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,000
it's not just hey bad ip go look at this

901
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,320
but rather hey we identified credential

902
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,720
stuffing activity from this address

903
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,960
which is located in a vps server farm

904
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,559
somewhere or whatever you might want to

905
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,000
look at this as a possible initial

906
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,480
access vector into our environment very

907
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,640
simplistic example but at least starting

908
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,279
to get into the multi-faceted approach

909
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,640
that we need to take from detection

910
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,240
development in order to come up with

911
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,159
items that are high confidence

912
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,320
reduce the

913
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,200
incidence of false positives and allows

914
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,039
the responding

915
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,519
analyst to have some context around why

916
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,120
it matters what it is they need to do

917
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,039
about these sorts of activities

918
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,960
so in looking at that we can take this

919
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,720
mindset that we see in the development

920
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,279
of lego over the last 20 30 years

921
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,120
looking at things like the star wars

922
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,880
ultimate collector series

923
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,640
the various technic

924
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,480
sets which are very complex and very

925
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,679
interesting if you've never put one

926
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,799
together they are uh pretty cool in

927
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,039
order to mess around with among other

928
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,960
structures and taking this way of

929
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,799
understanding how pieces fundamentally

930
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,880
fit together in order to then translate

931
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,559
that into a way of building threat

932
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,399
detections within the products and the

933
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,320
visibility that we have at our disposal

934
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,480
from a security perspective

935
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,919
so if we're looking at this and building

936
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,760
out a detection what does this look like

937
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,600
in practice well

938
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,960
you know instead of doing something like

939
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,600
i want to alert on here's evil hash

940
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,880
whatever

941
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,120
for

942
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,440
some kill disc variant or pick a malware

943
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,880
family that you like

944
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,480
well i don't want to alert on a hash

945
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,240
because as we know from dave bianco and

946
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,480
others hashes are trivially easy to

947
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,640
modify so instead

948
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,559
i want to try and identify some way of

949
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,720
identifying the malicious or suspicious

950
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,120
use of software within my environment so

951
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,799
maybe i start with a hypothesis like you

952
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,720
know what files that execute from app

953
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,960
data user local temp or

954
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,360
user app data local temp

955
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,200
that's usually not good i mean yes

956
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,559
chrome installs from there and some

957
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,320
other things which goes into what you're

958
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,080
allowing or denying in your environment

959
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,880
but file execution from temp directory

960
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,440
like okay that seems like something that

961
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,880
could relate to

962
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,360
it minimum unauthorized if not outright

963
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,519
malicious activity but if we built this

964
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,279
out as a detection on its own provided

965
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,720
we haven't had the visibility in the

966
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,000
first place

967
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,679
that sucks um it's something it gives us

968
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,000
insight into certain activities that

969
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,639
could be used for malicious purposes

970
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,119
but yeah and comment and chat about like

971
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,719
webex and meeting apps that drop a

972
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,918
little installer or whatever that you

973
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,359
have to run every time

974
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,040
you're going to be drowning in noise

975
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,800
around these sorts of items so we need

976
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,320
to start building out a framework from

977
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,359
this central point of execution in

978
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,359
permissible environments on the

979
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,239
operating system to figure out like okay

980
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,320
well let's say i can contextualize where

981
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,399
that binary came from and it's coming

982
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,119
from an unknown or untrusted location so

983
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,639
instead of coming from webex or

984
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,879
microsoft or google

985
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,040
or whatnot it's coming from and this is

986
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,639
no offense to any of these providers

987
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,399
because in fact a lot of these providers

988
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,320
work very diligently to try to clean up

989
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,399
their environment but it's a download

990
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,960
from digitalocean or linode or

991
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,040
uh some other

992
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,200
ovh take your pick or whatever it's like

993
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,359
oh i have a binary file that's coming

994
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,720
from a

995
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,160
less than trustworthy area of the

996
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,680
internet that's not necessarily

997
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,640
associated with enterprise permissible

998
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,200
products and then it's dropping to temp

999
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,599
location and executing well now i'm

1000
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,640
starting to construct a

1001
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,280
building or a framework around that

1002
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,800
initial observation like hey things that

1003
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,560
executed out of temp are kind of weird

1004
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,160
well they're really weird if they start

1005
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,200
coming from

1006
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,440
locations that we don't trust or that we

1007
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,400
can't assess some degree of um

1008
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,960
reliability around where they originate

1009
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,560
but even that could be fuzzy because you

1010
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,960
see plenty of security plenty of

1011
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
software companies that rent out vps

1012
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,440
instances or use some aws instance in

1013
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,119
order to host updates and whatnot so

1014
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,720
like oh this still might be a little

1015
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,119
noisy but i can start expanding on this

1016
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,520
even further to look at sort of right of

1017
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,599
execution activity to say like you know

1018
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,440
what when i start seeing these three

1019
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,440
items correlated with one another

1020
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,839
binary downloaded from some untrusted

1021
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,480
location uh execution within the user's

1022
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,960
temp directory and then followed

1023
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,240
temporarily

1024
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,400
by you know either directly related to

1025
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,240
the process executing if i could have

1026
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,480
visibility for that or temporarily i

1027
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,560
identify network traffic shortly after

1028
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,119
that execution to a similarly unknown or

1029
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,440
untrusted network resource well now i'm

1030
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,960
cooking with something that has some

1031
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,280
legs to it and that can identify a

1032
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,440
sequence of individual observables that

1033
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,839
tie together into an overall structure

1034
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,240
of a security alert that provides some

1035
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,240
context for my responding analyst if

1036
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,839
they see that like oh it looks like i'm

1037
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,000
identifying a downloader here i should

1038
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
see like did it execute what came down

1039
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,920
from that follow-on communication and

1040
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,839
similar sorts of steps but also

1041
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,400
establishing enough sort of visibility

1042
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,800
around items so that i can

1043
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
significantly reduce my false positive

1044
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,880
incidence incident

1045
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,599
my number of false positive incidents

1046
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,160
while also ensuring that i'm capturing

1047
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,320
activity of interest that are part of an

1048
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,240
adversary's infection chain and again

1049
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,640
this is a really simplistic example uh

1050
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,560
there are carveouts and exceptions to

1051
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,320
this entire process depending upon your

1052
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,680
environment who your vendors are and

1053
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,960
what sort of other systems that you're

1054
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
using but this is what we need to start

1055
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,800
doing if we're thinking about

1056
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,400
threat detection

1057
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,640
or security detection development and

1058
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,320
detection engineering

1059
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,480
not looking at them is like oh if i p

1060
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,119
observe then alert but rather assembling

1061
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,720
these items from different observables

1062
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,720
just as we would build with lego bricks

1063
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,400
in order to come up with more complex

1064
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,960
and more interesting structures that fit

1065
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,720
into a more robust security posture

1066
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,960
so

1067
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,880
that is it for the prepared content i

1068
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,040
was tracking a couple of questions that

1069
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,359
popped up in the slack so i will review

1070
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,520
those momentarily

1071
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,760
you could look at the republic gunship

1072
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,119
which i put together over the christmas

1073
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,960
holidays while you're staring at that

1074
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,240
but also

1075
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
you can follow me on twitter if you do

1076
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,400
that i make no apology

1077
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,800
buy or beware there but also feel free

1078
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,160
to contact me

1079
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,440
a lot of the stuff that i talked about

1080
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,839
are things that i teach as part of my

1081
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,200
threat intelligence offering with

1082
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,960
perales so that's interesting reach out

1083
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,599
to me i also blog very frequently on my

1084
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,920
own at

1085
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,480
pilos.co

1086
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,160
but in looking at the chat let me try to

1087
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,119
find hey joe i got them all together oh

1088
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,720
sweet okay

1089
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,560
great presentation by the way this is a

1090
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,839
lot of fun um all right so

1091
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,079
let's see first um

1092
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,839
in regards to the first part of the

1093
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,720
presentation would miter attack help

1094
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,560
miter attack definitely helps because it

1095
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,040
starts identifying

1096
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,280
gaps and holes in the overall detection

1097
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,720
framework so the point of this

1098
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,119
presentation was more upon

1099
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,359
focused on developing

1100
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,960
specific detections around specific

1101
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,680
activities if we start expanding that

1102
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,359
approach to a more macro level of

1103
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,720
thinking like well what detections do i

1104
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,480
need in my environment well that's where

1105
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,160
attack steps into play where i can do an

1106
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,480
assessment based upon visibility and

1107
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,880
existing detection coverage of like well

1108
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,640
what attack techniques am i covering

1109
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,400
right now what attack techniques am i

1110
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,160
missing or do i have less than ideal

1111
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,240
coverage in order to prioritize the

1112
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,560
development of subsequent items so

1113
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,240
you've got to start somewhere and i

1114
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
would advocate for this very building

1115
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,560
block approach to detection development

1116
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,480
but once that starts kicking off in a

1117
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,160
meaningful fashion and you start

1118
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,560
developing an overall security program

1119
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,720
having a framework like mitre attack or

1120
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,160
at a more abstracted level even

1121
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,240
something like just kill chain analysis

1122
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,839
can be very valuable in trying to

1123
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,640
identify what are areas of priority for

1124
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,079
resource investment and for analyst

1125
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,000
research and development in order to

1126
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,520
sort of fill those gaps and plug those

1127
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,839
holes

1128
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,119
great thank you

1129
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,040
next question is there an open source

1130
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,640
threat detection playbook or some

1131
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,400
guidance out there i know some folks

1132
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,160
already shared some but i guess if you

1133
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,960
have any off the top of your head

1134
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,359
you can post them in track one chat

1135
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,599
whenever you get a chance or if you want

1136
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,440
to tell them what it is

1137
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,119
yeah i mean there's some things i that i

1138
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,720
noticed coming across in slack which

1139
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,680
would be the same things i would

1140
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,640
recognize like uh things like caldera

1141
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,319
attack emulation frameworks there's some

1142
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,560
vendors that do that as well but again

1143
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,880
mitre has some frameworks that'll align

1144
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,760
with this

1145
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,200
pretty nicely that could be used in

1146
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,800
order to make this happen

1147
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,119
this is an area of ongoing research for

1148
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,280
myself so maybe i'll have something

1149
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,920
later this year we'll see at least at a

1150
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,000
sort of philosophical level for how to

1151
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,040
approach this subject but um

1152
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,400
yeah i mean there are a number of

1153
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,839
resources it's really about trying to

1154
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,520
figure out both what appetite the

1155
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,280
organization has as well as the

1156
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,680
resources to follow up for whatever good

1157
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,079
ideas uh come across in order to then

1158
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,720
execute on

1159
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,200
excellent um

1160
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,359
next was could you talk more about what

1161
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,599
context means for you

1162
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,119
this person was on a detection

1163
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,800
development side and now is in ir

1164
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,319
they can't analyze the incident if they

1165
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,160
don't know what they're catching and

1166
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,520
what you're missing with the established

1167
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,119
detection so sometimes that needs to be

1168
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,720
very detailed

1169
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,800
yeah i mean a bit of all of that um you

1170
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,240
know one of the points that i started

1171
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,839
off with is that detection development

1172
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,359
seems like it's just an assumed

1173
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,520
competency when it comes to security

1174
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,760
that outside of building tool specific

1175
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,440
items there's very little in terms of

1176
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,240
education or

1177
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,800
theory behind how it is these items get

1178
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,079
constructed and why they should be

1179
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,920
constructed in certain ways

1180
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,119
so first identifying that gap and then

1181
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,560
trying to figure out well based upon the

1182
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,040
disciplines that we do have insight into

1183
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,200
whether that's incident response sock

1184
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,520
operations cyber threat intelligence

1185
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,839
network and host forensics uh how do we

1186
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,599
combine viewpoints from those in order

1187
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,960
to start building

1188
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,319
a detection

1189
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,200
life cycle or concrete detection items

1190
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,040
that we know that we'll need or that

1191
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,720
will address some of the questions that

1192
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,200
we'll have when these items come across

1193
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,240
so

1194
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,920
i guess the

1195
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,920
the thesis that was unstated

1196
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,440
as part of this and which if i were to

1197
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,720
revise this and give it again i would

1198
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,880
include at the forefront is looking at

1199
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,680
detection as being the

1200
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,839
center point or the nexus around which

1201
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,079
other security operations disciplines

1202
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,400
revolve around both for building out

1203
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,000
what those detections should be as well

1204
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,119
as responding to them after the fact and

1205
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,240
ignoring that discipline is really to

1206
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,720
our detriment because

1207
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,440
this is really the driving factor beyond

1208
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,040
third party external notification that

1209
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,800
hey you have a breach of how we figure

1210
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,560
out that something bad is going on and

1211
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
that we've under-invested in my opinion

1212
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,280
in this discipline is is pretty tragic

1213
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,560
and we need to start fixing that

1214
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,880
okay

1215
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,640
now over to the lego questions

1216
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,800
so i know you showed quite a few uh

1217
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,720
images and

1218
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,640
i don't know which specific one this is

1219
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,880
for but uh how long does the lego

1220
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,160
structure

1221
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,839
like that take the build i'm assuming it

1222
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,160
was like the massive dinosaur ones the

1223
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,200
trees um i'm sure every everyone is

1224
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
different how do you as a lego

1225
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,800
aficionado

1226
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,560
do you kind of have a good idea of like

1227
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,240
how long something's gonna take before

1228
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,160
you even start

1229
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,960
i can guesstimate by the number of bags

1230
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,680
that are in a given set uh so one thing

1231
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,440
for those who have been doing lego for a

1232
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,520
while uh may

1233
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,280
appreciate

1234
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,359
back in the day back when i was a kid

1235
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,119
and we were walking uphill both ways in

1236
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,839
the snow and whatnot backwards uh lego

1237
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,119
sets were

1238
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,119
pretty hard to build the instructions

1239
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,560
are like okay here's a list of all the

1240
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,240
steps there's no words whatsoever and

1241
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,560
everything comes in the same box now

1242
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,160
things are broken up in such a fashion

1243
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,280
where

1244
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,560
you have instructions broken down by bag

1245
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,720
numbers so you can follow things through

1246
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,160
fairly well and not have to do things

1247
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,599
like hunt for pieces and whatnot which

1248
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,839
makes things exceptionally easy i would

1249
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,920
argue not as fun for the kids these days

1250
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,040
but you know still uh probably makes the

1251
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,880
process significantly more efficient

1252
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,640
well as a result of that if i can get an

1253
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,319
idea for how many bags a set has like oh

1254
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,560
that gives me a ballpark idea like

1255
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,119
30 to 45 minutes a bag as a very

1256
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,720
conservative sort of estimate sounds

1257
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,720
about right depending upon what it is

1258
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,160
that you're building that may either go

1259
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,800
up or could go way down so for example

1260
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,520
the

1261
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,680
star destroyer the ultimate collector

1262
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,440
series one which was about three feet

1263
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,560
long

1264
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,000
that took me

1265
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,680
mean i did it over the course of a month

1266
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,560
and probably around 16 to 20 hours worth

1267
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,160
of dedicated time

1268
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,520
um

1269
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,040
yeah so

1270
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,000
you know

1271
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,920
they certainly can get pretty complex

1272
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,920
pretty quickly but then on the other end

1273
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,640
uh

1274
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,319
you know there are other items like let

1275
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,480
me see if i can find one

1276
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,000
like this guy

1277
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,960
you know

1278
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,839
this tie fighter this took me maybe 45

1279
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,599
minutes to build um

1280
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,920
yeah so it's highly variable depending

1281
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,599
upon what it is you're you're dealing

1282
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,680
with and how complex the build is the

1283
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,839
star destroyer being very

1284
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,040
interesting just because of the fact

1285
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,960
that it's also designed that you have

1286
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,240
that central

1287
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,839
spine that i talked about earlier and

1288
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,440
then having individual plates hanging

1289
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,680
off of it and suspended from it as the

1290
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,560
actual uh outline of the

1291
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,960
set itself

1292
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,040
so for some of those massive structures

1293
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,800
that you saw in person

1294
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,640
did they give any information on like

1295
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,119
this took x amount of days to build or

1296
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,319
whatever

1297
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,720
you know i don't recall seeing that i

1298
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,520
did get some insight on the tree of

1299
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,520
creativity that that took something like

1300
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,200
a couple of weeks in order to build that

1301
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,760
out and it took several months prior to

1302
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,200
that in order to actually design the

1303
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,839
structure uh one of the cool things if

1304
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,319
anyone is a complete lego nerd like i am

1305
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,640
you need to get to berlund uh it's a fun

1306
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,079
little town it's not a whole lot going

1307
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,079
on there there's two bars so you know

1308
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,000
don't go there for the night life but

1309
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,599
you can go see things like the lego

1310
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,440
design studio where people actually come

1311
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,680
up with these kits and get an insight in

1312
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,920
just what it means to develop a lego set

1313
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,640
from just selection of pieces into a

1314
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,319
concrete object and just how long that

1315
00:45:58,319 --> 00:45:59,920
takes so as we start looking at

1316
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,440
something like the dinosaurs or the tree

1317
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,000
of creativity yeah construction

1318
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,800
a couple of weeks of dedicated man

1319
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,200
or person time or whatever in order to

1320
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,599
pull that off but then behind the scenes

1321
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,520
we're talking months upon months of

1322
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,319
design activity in order to figure out

1323
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,599
just how to construct these sorts of

1324
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,800
items to

1325
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,000
come up with the finished product

1326
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,040
great and then lastly what is your take

1327
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,640
on lego's axle gate uh the fact that

1328
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,880
someone might not be able to dismantle a

1329
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,079
piece such as at that

1330
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,200
could you repeat that i didn't quite

1331
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,040
understand the first time yeah yeah like

1332
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,880
um what's your take on the fact that

1333
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,839
some pieces can't be dis uh

1334
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,440
dismantled um due to like that the way

1335
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,680
the axle is built uh there's a lot of

1336
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,400
chat in the chat about that so oh well

1337
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,079
i'll probably jump into the chat then

1338
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,160
answer that more robustly it is very

1339
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,640
interesting with lego that they are a

1340
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,680
very

1341
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,359
product and quality

1342
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,359
oriented organization just for my own

1343
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,960
professional dealings with them it's one

1344
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,040
of the things that drives their business

1345
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,480
and so from their perspective while

1346
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,640
there's certainly intellectual property

1347
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,839
facets to that discussion i i know

1348
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,839
from the standpoint of the people who

1349
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,359
were there that it's also a question of

1350
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,400
trying to ensure a consistent and high

1351
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,880
quality experience for people uh as they

1352
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,880
interact with the items which is why you

1353
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,559
know it's been a big deal trying to

1354
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,800
transition lego from the existing sort

1355
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,040
of abs style plastic that they use to

1356
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,880
guarantee the long life of the bricks

1357
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,640
towards something more eco-friendly but

1358
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,480
that retains the same

1359
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,240
tactile and dirt

1360
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,280
experience and durability as the legacy

1361
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,640
items so

1362
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,319
yeah from a maker perspective it kind of

1363
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,520
stinks not being able to reverse

1364
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,119
engineer everything but i think that

1365
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,240
there's

1366
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,920
good intentions behind that at least to

1367
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,599
a certain extent

1368
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,960
absolutely

1369
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,760
well thank you joe this was great if

1370

00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,640
