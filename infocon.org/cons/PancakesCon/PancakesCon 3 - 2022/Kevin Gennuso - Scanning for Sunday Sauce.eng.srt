1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,560
hey thanks everybody uh i appreciate you

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,279
joining today on a sunday it seemed

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,879
appropriate that we make some sunday

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:07,839
sauce

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,840
and uh we'll talk about end map a little

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,040
bit first

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,599
and um you know go through the whole

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,320
thing

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,560
all right

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,160
hopefully that looks good for everybody

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,000
so i'll give you a background on who i

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,199
am um a little bit about nmap

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,760
and i was actually just came off of a

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,240
talk from brienne where she uh touched

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,079
on it a little bit uh we'll dig a little

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,559
bit deeper into uh some of the tips and

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,559
tricks you might be able to do

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,360
uh some additional things that you might

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,600
not think about from a quarter scanner

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,360
and then we'll get lost in the sauce and

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
uh talk about a

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,600
really delicious um and a hearty meal or

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,160
or set of meals that you can have

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,640
uh if you just take a sunday and do a

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
little cooking and i know if we have

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,680
time we'll do q a hit up uh questions in

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,160
the slack i'm watching that too

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,679
and thank you so much for being here

29

you know really talented team you

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,080
wouldn't think that if you're selling

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,680
footballs that you'd have to worry about

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,080
bad guys but uh we do

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,400
and we we have a lot of a lot of work to

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,280
do there over in the retail space and uh

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,720
we're hiring

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,320
sam

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,040
uh i love passwords and get requests

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,759
uh secrets and repos long walks on your

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,960
cloud um i kind of came up from uh

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,600
you know more pen testing background uh

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,680
i really got my start in network

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,439
engineering so i've been doing this for

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,840
a long time you can see the gray beard

50
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,040
is real

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,799
this is what happens when you work in

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,880
this industry for for this amount of

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,759
time

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,479
and a little bit noisy at times uh i've

55
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,600
done some work for sands b sides

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
derby con uh

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,120
miss that one uh and uh infra guard

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,520
this is actually i'm based out of

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
columbus ohio

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,480
uh but i grew up and just moved out here

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,720
to ohio about three years ago so i'm

62
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,560
originally a pittsburgher through and

63
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,239
through and you can kind of see that by

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,720
this right here there's a very special

65
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,879
terrible target right here this uh

66
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,519
that's a department of justice logo

67
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,280
stamped on this guy

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,560
and they gave that to me out of

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,640
pittsburgh for helping them out with uh

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,040
infragard so

71
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,879
yeah been around for a little bit uh

72
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,000
happy to be here for sure uh

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,200
really great set of speakers uh just

74
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
honored to be in this company

75
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,640
um but all this

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,160
crap that you're seeing up on the screen

77
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,680
right here is really just to say i've

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,760
seen some things i've seen a lot of

79
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,239
things uh some of those things i wish i

80
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,440
had eye bleach for um but you know how

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
it goes right we've we've all seen

82
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,040
things if you've worked in an infosec

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,519
for any amount of time so

84
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,440
uh this is what information security

85
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,200
looks like it takes pretty good you know

86
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,920
you're just trying to stay healthy live

87
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,120
the brand you know exercise do all the

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,560
right stuff right but you're fighting

89
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,319
invisible bad guys

90
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,920
and uh you know sometimes that's a

91
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,840
little tough uh

92
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,040
we run into issues everybody has has uh

93
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
you know

94
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,119
that they're dealing with

95
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,200
what it looks like

96
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,920
so let's start with the sauce and and uh

97
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,760
we'll talk about nmf

98
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,920
it's a foundational pool it really got

99
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,879
me started in this whole thing um but

100
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,879
you know one of the first jobs that i

101
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,280
got in information security was because

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,159
of

103
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,720
uh being able to use nmap being able to

104
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,480
discover things that uh you know are

105
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,920
misconfigurations or vulnerabilities or

106
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,959
what have you

107
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,159
um so

108
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,159
it's it's

109
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,159
for me it's like swiss army knife and

110
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,159
also like very near and dear to my heart

111
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,959
almost uh it really did uh allow me to

112
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,239
start this in this industry um so

113
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,560
i just wanted to you know bring this out

114
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,599
here and see if folks would be

115
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,400
interested

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,839
you have to know your tcp to use it

117
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,399
so it's it's it's foundational at that

118
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,358
level

119
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,600
but you know i think most folks have

120
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,120
have a good grasp that they're working

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,560
in in cyber security it does port scans

122
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,880
and beyond and

123
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,479
what i mean by that is you know being

124
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,080
able to pull back

125
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,800
things like service banners uh you can

126
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
even do vulnerability scanning uh

127
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,199
so there's there's a ton of stuff that

128
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,520
you can do with it and we'll focus on

129
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,600
the beyond stuff here

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
uh we won't spend too much time on the

131
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,080
basics

132
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,160
um so

133
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,440
there there's

134
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,320
you know

135
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,759
if you're gonna start

136
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,960
doing a scan you should do so uh

137
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
with a good idea of what you actually

138
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,880
care about in a scan

139
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,840
so

140
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,560
discovery scans are a great way to to

141
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,039
really understand what your scope looks

142
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,360
like so that you're not scanning the

143
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,400
world uh so you can do some really quick

144
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,120
and kind of dirty discovery scans uh

145
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,880
that'll all you're looking for is just a

146
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,759
response if i send a packet to you and

147
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,400
you respond then i'm interested right

148
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,039
but uh i'll build out my scope of what

149
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,199
i'm actually going to dig into

150
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,039
uh based on what a discovery scan

151
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,240
returns

152
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,400
um and yeah you can't secure what you

153
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
don't know about right this is something

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,199
we deal with

155
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,520
every day is information security

156
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,720
professionals

157
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,199
uh just being mindful if if you're gonna

158
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,919
be doing some um

159
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,600
any sort of a port scanning discovery

160
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,400
scheme whatever be mindful of your

161
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,600
egress filters so a lot of times you

162
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,360
know you want to take a look at what

163
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,319
your

164
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,080
perimeter looks like and that you know

165
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,360
that terms

166
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
kind of dated and going away nowadays uh

167
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
but if you're scanning a you know a

168
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,639
slash 24 or some

169
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,440
some

170
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,840
network that you own or are interested

171
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,639
in or are permitted to to do pen testing

172
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,880
on whatever um

173
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,199
be mindful of the egress filters that

174
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,960
might be applied to you

175
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,680
uh so what i mean by that is

176
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,240
you know if you land on on a system

177
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,080
you're not sure what you're allowed to

178
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,680
scan outbound

179
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,560
uh there are ways to test for that a lot

180
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,400
of like residential isps do

181
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,680
uh port filtering and they as you know

182
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,960
they're trying to protect their

183
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,199
customers right uh but they're also

184
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,600
trying to protect their own buds and so

185
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,120
a lot of times you'll find egress

186
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,800
filters applied to

187
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,400
uh comcast for example or att they all

188
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,080
do it um

189
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,120
this actually bit me once at a previous

190
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,440
organization i worked for we had brought

191
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,319
in a uh it was a comcast for business

192
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,280
line

193
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,919
and uh you know we would do a regular

194
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,800
external scans of our environment and

195
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,720
uh everything could come back clean

196
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,120
right and then i jumped over from my

197
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,680
house and just did basically the same

198
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,919
thing and found that we had a couple

199
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,240
hosts that were listening on tcp 445

200
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,840
uh externally uh which is not good if

201
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,759
you know anything about that so

202
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,720
um

203
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,560
turned out to be nothing it was a load

204
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,960
balancer that was relaying traffic back

205
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,639
to nothing but

206
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,800
we didn't see that from our comcast for

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,720
business line and that's because they

208
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,360
intentionally filter egress traffic

209
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,880
heading towards tcp 445 in an attempt to

210
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,280
like block you know worms and other

211
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
malware and that kind of stuff so

212
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,080
uh just be mindful that you know and you

213
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,759
if you scan through a a pf sets uh box

214
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,759
for example if you have sense

215
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,280
you know you can configure

216
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,080
proxying and other things there um so

217
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,160
just be mindful you should do this

218
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,400
probably from a vps you know spin up

219
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,479
spin up a vm instance and gcp or you

220
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,919
know aws whatever and just make sure

221
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,400
that you aren't being blocked and

222
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,360
uh you can use this uh all ports dot

223
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,560
exposed

224
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
which is a really great tool for for

225
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,319
seeing if you are

226
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,080
being subject to egress filtering

227
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,120
because it listens on all ports as the

228
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,479
name kind of suggests uh so really easy

229
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,440
way to see uh what reports are open to

230
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,919
you and hopefully uh you know we don't

231
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,799
get blocked on any of them

232
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,640
and yeah if you're doing this in an

233
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
environment where you have a blue team

234
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,480
that's monitoring traffic and that sort

235
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,640
of thing like maybe let them know that

236
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,600
you're going to

237
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,360
run some of these scans because you're

238
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
definitely going to light things up uh

239
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,360
for their alarms and that sort of thing

240
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,200
um so this is a command that you can use

241
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,000
um what this is doing you should always

242
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,320
be rude when you're running nmap uh just

243
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,240
because it opens up all the different

244
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,720
scan types if you're not rude you're

245
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,600
just going to get tcp connect scans and

246
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,080
that just doesn't allow you to craft

247
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,320
packets or do any of those sort of

248
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,440
interesting

249
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,760
uh discovery that you would you would do

250
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,200
if you were root so

251
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,560
always sudo

252
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,720
and then the dash bv makes it very

253
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,920
verbose

254
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,120
the sn says okay i don't want to do a

255
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,480
port scan

256
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,880
so don't do any of your normal

257
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,600
port scan stuff

258
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,040
and then some of these other options

259
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,279
here p0 pe ppm so these are ultimately

260
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,120
um you know

261
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,000
different types of discovery pe is your

262
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,360
your icmp echo or your icmp

263
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,680
discovery but it's not necessarily using

264
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,279
echo um it uses some other um you know

265
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,080
other icmp tests as well

266
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,720
uh and the same for the other guys uh

267
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,160
this one here is uh it's an ip protocol

268
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,279
ping so they'll do things like igmp

269
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,200
ipn ip

270
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,360
um so these are all really good for

271
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,200
discovery and then you can either list

272
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,279
your targets on the command line or you

273
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,120
can use an input list which i highly

274
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,399
suggest

275
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,440
um yeah show me very very verbosely

276
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,200
without a port scan

277
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,160
you know

278
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,920
using all these different probes that's

279
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,560
what that says

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,079
so you can add a dash pa uh or dash ps

281
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,480
or a dash pu so that's going to be ax

282
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,600
scan sin scan udp scan

283
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,120
to the last command

284
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,880
and again we're just looking for any

285
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,560
kind of response we just want something

286
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,519
to say i'm out here uh so that we can

287
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,959
dig into it a little further we don't

288
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,839
want to

289
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,120
totally beat it down with all the

290
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,959
different uh

291
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,079
things that nmap can do

292
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,880
yeah and always uh you know it's the

293
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,720
easiest thing if you're going after

294
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,399
anything more complex than a couple

295
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,640
hosts or a couple sudden that's use the

296
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,480
dash il for input list and then output

297
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,959
uh via oa

298
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,120
so there's there's four different output

299
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,320
formats uh that map can

300
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,040
you know dump out to uh dash o n is

301
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,880
normal dash o g

302
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,000
is greppable really easy to search

303
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,120
ox

304
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
is um

305
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,000
xml and you need it if you ever want to

306
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,680
resume you need that output uh so

307
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,839
you know if you're not worried about a

308
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,279
couple extra

309
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,160
you know kilobytes of uh storage just

310
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,640
dash o in and uh you know dump it out

311
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,680
there

312
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,600
and then you can do a blind discovery as

313
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,360
well with the dash pn

314
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,240
um but yeah that's ultimately gonna

315
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,120
negate uh you know some of the other

316
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,639
commands above

317
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,959
um so it's it's a swiss army knife use

318
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,920
it as you need it

319
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,040
all right well that's a disaster if you

320
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,440
try to read it but it's not that bad um

321
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,760
so this is this is one of the discovery

322
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,800
commands that i like to use um

323
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,880
so we're going after we're going to do

324
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,079
an ax scan on on a lot of common ports

325
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,079
and basically the same ports we're going

326
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,720
to do a syn

327
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,240
discovery on

328
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,720
and then udp as well and these are just

329
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,680
common udp ports that are out there if

330
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,839
you try to do everything

331
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,720
you're gonna be there for a while uh and

332
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,040
and you know you don't you don't wanna

333
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,800
spend all day just trying to figure out

334
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,959
and the udp scanning rate if you know

335
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,680
how udp works it's not super accurate

336
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,760
anyway so if you try to go after 65 535

337
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,720
ports

338
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,480
on udp

339
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,880
you'll be waiting a bit um

340
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,800
and then as you can see at the end we're

341
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,320
doing an input list of sources.txt and

342
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,800
oa for discovery and what this will

343
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,560
ultimately output is uh

344
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,480
discovery.nmap which is the normal

345
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,519
output

346
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,360
uh discovery.gn map and and so on so you

347
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,680
end up with three files uh as a result

348
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,479
of this one command

349
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,000
so

350
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,240
the idea is you know do your discovery

351
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,680
and then take that and go deeper with it

352
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,639
so

353
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,480
like i said always be rude if you're

354
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,800
trying to send weird packets uh you can

355
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,320
only send weird packets of goop root uh

356
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,600
and then yeah

357
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
that's that's then you can see this a

358
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,760
little different.su we're using a

359
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,120
lowercase s

360
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,760
these are indicating tcp syn and udp

361
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,760
scans so these are actual report scans

362
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,000
and dash a is

363
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,240
the aggressive command so this will

364
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,279
execute a number of uh lua scripts and

365
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,199
we'll talk about that in a minute but it

366
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,920
will execute a number of lua scripts

367
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,560
that will do things like os discovery

368
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,959
services running um if you're going

369
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,959
against a windows machine it'll bring it

370
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,600
back like it's that bios host name and

371
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,199
other things like that

372
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,760
um that'll pull back banners for for all

373
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,199
sorts of stuff

374
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,519
and just really handy if if you're

375
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,519
trying to figure out what is this thing

376
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,360
that i'm looking at it's just popped up

377
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,680
on the network i have no idea what it is

378
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,240
um it's definitely noisy it's definitely

379
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,519
gonna make make alarms for blue team if

380
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,399
they're watching so i you know use

381
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,360
sparingly or use contextually

382
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,800
uh you know it's not something you just

383
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,199
want to tack on in every single scenario

384
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,920
and that's what this kind of looks like

385
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,519
um so

386
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,440
you know this is a little different now

387
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,519
we're doing the dash a for aggressive

388
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,760
s-u-s-s for uh udp and scan dash pn

389
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,839
we're not gonna do a discovery because

390
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,880
we already know from what we just did

391
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,600
what's alive or what we want to target

392
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,920
um the dash t4 i just threw in there so

393
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
this is a timing parameter

394
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,160
uh to say that we're going to be pretty

395
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,720
aggressive with our time the default is

396
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,959
dash three and you can go from one to

397
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,959
five here uh dash vv for very verbose

398
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,959
uh max host group this is just uh

399
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,560
limiting the number of posts that you're

400
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,800
scanning at once and uh it's kind of a

401
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,240
performance thing

402
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
and then the dash p we're gonna indicate

403
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,199
which ports we're going after and uh so

404
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,040
for t for tcp we care about all of them

405
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,240
uh for udp here's your list

406
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,079
and then we're again importing our

407
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,199
targets and outputting to uh final and

408
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,360
that again will result in

409
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,880
uh three different types of output

410
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,920
now aside from port scanning like i said

411
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,079
it does a lot of stuff uh the scripts

412
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,160
are written in lua they can detect weird

413
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,880
services vulnerabilities etc

414
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,920
uh like i said smb info oh yeah that's a

415
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,480
good one uh certificates it'll pull back

416
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,440
like the full certificate and just dump

417
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
it out there like all the you know if

418
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,240
it's a sans certificate with uh subject

419
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,560
alternative names or you know any of the

420
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,240
info that might be in their expiration

421
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,360
whatever um it'll pull back super super

422
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,320
helpful

423
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,639
and um

424
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,360
yeah everybody's like uh all

425
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,120
still probably licking their wounds a

426
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,360
little bit from log for j

427
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,120
uh so these things

428
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,279
you know these these um

429
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,000
uh nse scripts the lewis grips

430
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,199
they they are released uh all the time

431
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,399
uh so

432
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,519
uh theodore the guy who writes uh nmap

433
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,440
he'll roll them up

434
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,000
and uh put them into the to the package

435
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,759
you know his new versions are released

436
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,199
but every once in a while when there's

437
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,120
like a serious vulnerability that uh

438
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
ends up out there somebody will go right

439
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,639
in an sd script

440
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,040
and make it available to the world which

441
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,079
is super helpful and uh allows you to

442
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,959
basically scan for that log4j

443
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,600
vulnerability using nmap

444
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,519
and be very targeted about like i'm only

445
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,039
interested in this one vulnerability

446
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,640
maybe against this set of systems uh so

447
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,480
it makes things a little quick and dirty

448
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,559
uh as opposed to like okay let's fire up

449
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,280
the vulnerability scanner or you know

450
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,880
maybe the vulnerability scanner hasn't

451
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,280
even gotten a signature for this yet uh

452
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,839
which happens you know so

453
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,240
uh pretty pretty slick a very very

454
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,679
helpful um again it's it's beyond port

455
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,799
scanning and um

456
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,640
and you would think like nmap you know

457
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,960
it's been around since the 90s it's it's

458
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,200
you know definitely seen its years like

459
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,039
myself but

460
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,280
uh it is definitely a living breathing

461
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,960
thing and you have stuff like this nse

462
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,880
script which is like super new and

463
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,360
scanning for a very uh new type of

464
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,640
vulnerability

465
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,280
and at the same time um there's a guy

466
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,960
named soldier

467
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,200
of fort tran on twitter i don't know if

468
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,120
you've ever seen him around but he's a

469
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,160
mainframe guy and uh he released his own

470
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,360
nse scripts to detect mainframe type

471
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,840
stuff that nobody really ever thought

472
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,240
about and uh even though mainframe is

473
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,559
still like 100 in in a lot of

474
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,000
environments right now especially in

475
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,039
financial

476
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,320
uh so

477
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,799
good stuff this is not you know this is

478
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,000
i've used nmap for years uh i'm still

479
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,400
learning how to use it uh you know this

480
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,840
is this is one of those things you could

481
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,400
spend a lot of time uh

482
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,919
you know just learning about it and

483
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,320
finding new things about it so

484
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,880
don't be afraid

485
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
uh yeah i mentioned input lists before

486
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,039
they can contain single ips

487
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,400
ranges

488
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,880
wild cards in those ranges

489
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,840
uh or cyber notation so you can you know

490
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,080
do a slash 24 slash

491
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,360
16 slash 18 whatever

492
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,640
um and i mentioned this output

493
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,679
can be normal grippable or xml

494
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,440
and then that should go away always dash

495
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,880
it away it'll save you today

496
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,080
uh some other tricks if you're in the

497
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,440
middle of the scan and you're like what

498
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,760
the heck is going on uh

499
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,520
you can always hit the spacebar for the

500
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,360
current status you know it'll tell you

501
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,799
what's going on

502
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,160
um you can also add dash e dash in place

503
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,679
of dash p1 through 65 535

504
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,760
um so it's you know just

505
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,160
kind of shortcut uh to be able to scan

506
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,240
all ports

507
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
and then if for some reason you have to

508
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,559
cancel a scan or you know the box you

509
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,480
were scanning from dies or whatever

510
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,600
happens

511
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,440
you can pick it back up with a dash dash

512
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,000
resume from the same directory that you

513
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,960
launched it from where the xml format is

514
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,160
because you use dash uh oa because you

515
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,960
love

516
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,240
dash oa

517
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,720
uh so you just launch it from there uh

518
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,400
that end map will pick up from where it

519
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,880
left off

520
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,919
and dashboard open is is cool to have

521
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,160
around as well um just because it'll

522
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,919
it'll only report

523
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,919
the the ports that are open you might

524
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,919
care about things that are closed and so

525
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,679
don't use it if that's the case but if

526
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,520
you don't you only want to know what's

527
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,320
open throw that in there and it'll cut

528
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,960
down the noise

529
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,240
so some ancillary tools

530
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,400
around nmap these are a little lesser

531
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,280
known

532
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,120
um nping

533
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,760
uh you can you can download separately

534
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,200
on linux uh but on mac and windows nping

535
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,880
kind of comes with the bundle

536
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,520
and it lets you ping any protocol and

537
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,400
port

538
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
and so you know if you think about your

539
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,200
typical ping it's icmp ping

540
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,720
and there's plenty of things that can

541
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,039
get in the way of that uh firewalls

542
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,440
whatever maybe host just doesn't respond

543
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,400
to ping

544
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,919
um with nping you can go after any port

545
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,720
and any protocol and get that same kind

546
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,679
of round trip time you know packet loss

547
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,200
all the stuff you get from your your

548
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,480
typical ping

549
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,880
um it sets flags you can set flags on

550
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,640
the on the uh

551
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,880
on the page you can set a ttl you can

552
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,440
change your source ip address uh and

553
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,880
paint from that

554
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,039
uh so it's like really simple packet

555
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,520
crafting uh you know it's like if you've

556
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,320
ever

557
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,640
taken a look at scapy for example

558
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,440
really great packet crafting tool but uh

559
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,400
you know kind of a steep learning curve

560
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,480
this one makes a little bit easier if

561
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,159
you just want to craft uh certain types

562
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,080
of packets and you know you can read the

563
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,880
docs uh to learn all about that it's

564
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,120
great for performance testing firewall

565
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,840
testing true round trip time

566
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,520
all that

567
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,080
uh so this is what uh nping command

568
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,320
might look like um so we're just gonna

569
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,679
talk to google over tcp port 80 we're

570
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,919
going to do it 10 times

571
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,640
and here's what the output looks like

572
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,919
and it's

573
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,240
you know pretty cool send it at this

574
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,159
time this is when it came back

575
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,559
you know if you look down at the bottom

576
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,080
my my max round trip time was was 233

577
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,320
milliseconds but average was 42 and

578
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,720
that's about expected tells you how long

579
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,679
it took for me to send 10 packets

580
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,600
9 seconds right

581
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,760
um so so very cool uh very helpful when

582
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,400
back in my my networking days this was a

583
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,559
really great way to to get folks to like

584
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,799
kind of confirm that the firewall rule

585
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,559
i've just put in place that was actually

586
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,720
working um so

587
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,360
good stuff

588
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,880
another ancillary tool is the um

589
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,960
uh ncat

590
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,039
so ncat is

591
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,520
netcat but a little bit better and the

592
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,000
reason i say that is because right out

593
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,400
of the box you're supporting ssl it can

594
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,159
do authentication

595
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,280
um it can do output of an entire session

596
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,600
just like with with a flag you just put

597
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,559
that as an option and it can do a lot

598
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,000
and deny lists

599
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,960
so

600
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,000
uh you know super helpful um

601
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,240
the the it also does shell and lua

602
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,919
script execution um i think that uh you

603
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,400
know you can you can certainly make

604
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,840
certain versions of netcat uh execute

605
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,559
scripts but it has to be that version

606
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,679
um netcat doesn't do luna skirts at all

607
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,760
um so the nice thing about ncat is that

608
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,840
it's like very consistent you know you

609
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,640
can take it from platform to platform

610
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
and uh just have it do the same thing

611
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,919
all the time

612
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,120
um

613
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,480
yeah so

614
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,600
here's what a

615
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,159
ncat command might look like it's super

616
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,640
similar to what you'd see with uh netcat

617
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,559
right you want to be root you're going

618
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,039
to listen all port 80 uh you're gonna

619
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,240
dash k which is uh persistence so you're

620
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,600
gonna keep that connection up all the

621
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,919
time don't kill it um and then you're

622
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,240
gonna execute this shell script you're

623
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,840
going to dump everything that's going on

624
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,559
with this little server that you set up

625
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,559
uh two things dot out

626
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,600
piece of cake right really really easy

627
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,440
super well documented it's just one of

628
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,600
those things that you know doesn't get a

629
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,120
lot of love so i like to talk about

630
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,918
every once in a while

631
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,279
so

632
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,360
if you aren't asleep at this point give

633
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,760
yourself a high five um

634
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,320
i appreciate you hanging in there is

635
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,880
kind of dry material

636
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,720
but if you like networking imports like

637
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,440
me maybe not so much so uh appreciate

638
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,080
you hanging in there and uh so we'll go

639
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,039
into the next uh area of this talk i

640
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,760
would say use these commands uh to find

641
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,360
the sauce the the recipe is on

642
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,880
awful.network and everything i just told

643
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,640
you about will help you find the full

644
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,440
recipe so a little bit of a little bit

645
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,640
of a

646
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,159
little treasure hunt for you how about

647
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,480
that

648
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,919
all right

649
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,640
so let's get lost in the sauce uh

650
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,159
what i'm about to show you is not my

651
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,880
grandmother's sauce um you know grandma

652
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,000
sauce was was uh

653
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,960
very good uh very delicious

654
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,640
um but not quite as uh focused on the

655
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,960
meats uh and i think that was just

656
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,000
because of you know uh where

657
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,240
you know how she grew up it was just not

658
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,640
a ton of money um

659
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,799
but you know that's that's

660
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,200
she brought what she got from italy over

661
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,480
and uh

662
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,159
you know that's that's kind of what the

663
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,279
basis of of what i started uh what i

664
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,640
started making here she'd be yelling if

665
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,880
she saw this recipe and i did see

666
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,200
there's a urban uh farming

667
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,120
presentation uh

668
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,480
i think it's uh tanya uh janet is doing

669
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,039
it later today and uh

670
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,400
you know she's gonna talk about urban

671
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,679
farming

672
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,919
my grandmother and grandfather had a had

673
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,320
a an urban farm uh going back to the 50s

674
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,760
it's just something you did as an

675
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,720
italian uh when you when you

676
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,320
had a house if you had a house and you

677
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,440
had some land you grew stuff you know

678
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,360
and um so

679
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,640
the tomatoes uh that she would use are

680
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,360
different than tomatoes that i use or

681
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,559
um

682
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,919
you know garlic

683
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,400
or onions oh you know all kinds of

684
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,159
ingredients they just they just pulled

685
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,840
out of pulled out of the ground um so

686
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,880
it's a little different but um you know

687
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,880
it's it's it's definitely where i come

688
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,120
from my background i remember being up

689
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,480
there in that garden

690
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,320
you know running around and picking

691
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,640
peppers and doing all that stuff now

692
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,000
unfortunately with the power of google

693
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,480
maps and that sort of stuff nowadays i

694
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,000
look at that old property and those

695
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,840
folks have never maintained gardens just

696
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,120
all grown over

697
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,799
so mad like

698
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,720
my grandmother's great jelly came from

699
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,240
that thing you know

700
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,720
but anyway let's get into it

701
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,600
oh there's there's my o.g sauce maker

702
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
that's my grandmother she's gone 15

703
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,120
years today

704
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,640
but it wasn't she beautiful my goodness

705
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,679
all right

706
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,960
so uh

707
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,600
you know this is i've constantly tweaked

708
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,760
and improved this recipe over time it

709
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,760
takes time um

710
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,679
you gotta learn what you like i'm not

711
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,080
your sauce boss go make it your own i

712
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,760
mean it's there's nothing controlling

713
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,679
you this is cooking you know the only

714
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,360
thing i would recommend is not to skimp

715
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,919
on the ingredients use good stuff

716
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,480
you know garbage in garbage out

717
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,360
so don't use the garbage

718
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,960
and by that i mean use actual real san

719
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,480
marzano tomatoes uh it'll have a doc or

720
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,559
a dop label on it that just basically

721
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,720
means it came from italy which is where

722
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,000
it should come from um use quality meats

723
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,720
quality uh extra virgin olive oil

724
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,919
um

725
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,960
parmesan or reggio parmesan reggiano

726
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,679
wrong uh so

727
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,679
this is one thing that you know the rest

728
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,440
of the sauce will cost you some money

729
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,200
but this is one thing you can actually

730
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,120
get the rind in some cases for free

731
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,039
uh which i didn't realize you just got

732
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,960
to get to know the cheese person you

733
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,760
know

734
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,480
and uh my cheese persian person just

735
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,240
like gave it right over

736
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,679
uh but

737
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,360
the other thing it requires is time you

738
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,360
gotta just take the time it's a sunday

739
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,158
sauce you know

740
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,120
so

741
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,640
no to san marzano style we don't want

742
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,679
style here we want the real deal okay

743
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,520
so assuming you find the recipe

744
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,799
with your end mapping uh you can use awk

745
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,799
to figure out how to prep and it's

746
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,960
basically dice your onions chop your

747
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,440
garlic handle your tomatoes what i mean

748
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,240
by that don't be gross talking about

749
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,000
some people like a chunkier sauce some

750
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,080
people like it a little thinner

751
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,559
i personally i like just i don't want to

752
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,799
see chunks of tomatoes in mine so i'd

753
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,440
use an immersion blender and just brown

754
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,720
you know blend those babies up and uh

755
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
you know it's just nice and smooth

756
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,840
and then uh you know take uh take the v

757
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,000
on the pork lightly season it with some

758
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,640
salt and pepper and break up the sausage

759
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,960
sausage if that's your thing uh i

760
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,360
usually get like a a pound or so of

761
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,480
sausage

762
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,200
and i'll take half of it take the

763
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,440
casings off and just make it loose but

764
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,960
you can do whatever you want it's your

765
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,320
sauce it's your thing

766
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,559
so this is from about

767
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,120
maybe three hours ago um i'm actually

768
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,039
doing this right now i'm not here to

769
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,399
joke around so

770
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,279
um

771
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,279
you know you have the tomatoes of course

772
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,120
have not been blended yet

773
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,600
sausage uh onions and garlic and veal

774
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,840
my goodness it's already looking so good

775
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,000
the problem is i can't i can't show you

776
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,919
how it smells i wish i could because

777
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,279
right now it's like

778
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,159
peak peak saw smells

779
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,919
um

780
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,159
yeah so then you braise this stuff right

781
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,120
so add some olive oil uh bring it to mid

782
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,000
high heat do the sausage first do the

783
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,960
pork next then do the veal chops

784
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,279
um and you know you're taking them off

785
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,360
each time and just cover them up for a

786
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,840
little bit

787
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,080
so it should look like

788
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,760
we're gonna be

789
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,880
not quite done just getting started

790
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,440
delicious

791
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,399
uh so then you drain off the fat once

792
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,399
you get all the meats cooked up

793
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,200
drain the fat uh you use

794
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,720
decent red wine it doesn't have to be

795
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,360
anything expensive whatever um and just

796
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,080
deglaze the pot scrape all the bits off

797
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,480
uh and it'll make like a nice kind of

798
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,520
you know

799
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,440
almost like a reduction really good

800
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,120
and then we start the sauce and uh to do

801
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,840
that you take some oil sweat the onions

802
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,679
do the garlic next add some tomato paste

803
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,600
and then the tomatoes and water the

804
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,279
parmesan rind a little bit of balsamic

805
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,240
vinegar add a little salt if you need to

806
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,200
and your sauce up to you and then add

807
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,760
the meats in and get some coffee or

808
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,519
whatever caffeinated beverage you would

809
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,320
want

810
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,200
uh

811
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,320
so

812
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,640
we're not done yet here right this is

813
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,559
just getting started we're just getting

814
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,760
things moving

815
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,120
um

816
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,679
so on the left there you see the onions

817
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,640
with that kind of uh you know deglazed

818
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,159
pot um you know with the red wine and

819
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,679
there's some

820
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,320
wonderful wonderful uh

821
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,240
tomato paste in there and then in the

822
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,679
middle you can see

823
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,240
um you know this is from

824
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,080

835
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,279
uh and then on the right that's we got

836
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,440

uh then for the meatloaf or for the for

842
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,760
the meatballs so i use a meatloaf mix

843
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,080
you can get it pretty much any any uh

844
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,320
butcher grocery store it's a it's a

845
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,440
three-way combination of beef pork and

846
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,600
veal um

847
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,640
i take about a pound and a quarter or so

848
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,600
of that

849
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,399
two eggs breadcrumbs cheese

850
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,440
again with the parmesan some garlic uh

851
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,480
some parsley some salt and pepper stir

852
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,279
it around use your hands don't be afraid

853
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,039
uh it's not gonna hurt you

854
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,279
and then uh just try to roll some equal

855
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,480
size meatballs um so that they cook up

856
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,640
about similar whenever uh whenever you

857
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,720
put them in

858
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,440
fire up a good pan i don't like using

859
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,559
like a non-stick pan for this uh just

860
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,559
because it doesn't get that good like

861
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,600
like brown kind of color on it um so i

862
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,880
like to use

863
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,120
you know just a just a good you know

864
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,279
good kind of uh like stuff stainless

865
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,039
steel kind of paint that kind of thing

866
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,880
keep them a little red inside you don't

867
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,480
have to cook them all the way through

868
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,240
they'll cook through uh once you add

869
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,039
them to the sauce

870
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,360
oh yeah and i meant to

871
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,519
mention one of these so i use one of

872
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,559
these grease splatter screen things uh

873
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,000
when i'm cooking this because you want

874
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,919
it to reduce and you want to cook over

875
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,320
time take a lot of time right but if you

876
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,159
don't use something like this your stove

877
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,600
is going to look like a murder scene

878
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,519
right we don't need sauce all over the

879
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,559
place so it's a good way to stop that um

880
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,720
and uh yeah this is what the meatball

881
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,640
mix looks like

882
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,159
after you've done stirring it up

883
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,559
little

884
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,480
meatball action here finished up

885
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,000
meatballs

886
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,760
browning them up looking beautiful right

887
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,679
and now we've added everything to the

888
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,799
sauce and the magic occurs right sleep

889
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,799
for four hours uh

890
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,040
take more time if you have it if you

891
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,960
want the meat to really really fall

892
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,839
apart

893
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,960
um you know give it five six hours uh

894
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,480
that's how i like to do mine especially

895
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,399
in the wintertime when it's super cold

896
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,320
it's just nice to have like a real like

897
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,839
kind of hearty

898
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,399
uh you know gravy sunday gravy on the

899
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,560
job setting this is you know sometimes

900
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,359
uh

901
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,119
called sunday gravy because it's it's

902
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,960
it's just you know sticks to your bones

903

it's really uh really hardy and it

904
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,599
tastes delicious give it enough time and

905
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,719
you're gonna adjust over time so

906
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,599
grab a dub serve it with quality pasta i

907
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,918
like to use fucilly the corkscrews uh

908
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,560
just because it catches the sauce um you

909
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,399
can use this for meatball and sausage

910
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,119
subs you're gonna have way way too much

911
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,879
food to eat in one sitting um so feel

912
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,639
free to you know use it for other other

913
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,480
ideas uh

914
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,240
you can also freeze it up that's what

915
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,560
i'm gonna do well i'm done with all this

916
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,480
and uh you know

917
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,520
tito enjoy

918
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,200
uh so i saw some questions coming in i

919
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,160
went a little bit quick

920
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,440
okay so one question is there a

921
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,200
preference for the ratio

922
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,560
cans of tomatoes to tomato paste

923
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,839
uh so yeah i i'll do um

924
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:28,839
basically

925
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,920
a tablespoon

926
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,040
uh and

927
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,200
well i'll do

928
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,320
see

929
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,880
i do two and a half tablespoons and so

930
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,960
it's basically like half a tablespoon

931
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,240
per can

932
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,520
um

933
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,920
but that's me and uh

934
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,359
you know to be honest i i can't

935
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,599
i can't say that i've ever really like

936
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,200
written this down

937
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,200
uh to this degree

938
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,720
before this talk

939
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,119
uh it's just a lot of like yeah

940
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,880
throw this in there and see how it

941
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,520
tastes you know check it out spend time

942
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,320
you know

943
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,240
you take your time with it and and you

944
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,680
know you'll figure out what works for

945
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,720
you um but yeah that's that's about my

946
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,920
ratio today it could change tomorrow

947
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,119
steve and i have been talking through

948
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,440
your entire talk and uh we've been

949
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,200
talking about sunday gravy and i was

950
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,640
looking at your recipe i'm like man this

951
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,800
dude is like this dude is copying my

952
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,720
recipe like this is exactly the way and

953
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,320
this is exactly the way he cooks sunday

954
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,520
gravy too

955
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,240
um and uh i i think i learned mine from

956
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,839
binging with babish i basically just

957
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,240
watch him and and i think he did prison

958
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,760
sauce the goodfellas prison sauce and

959
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,680
this is very very close to the way he

960
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,200
would do that

961
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,720
make sure you use three whole onions

962
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,680
three small onions

963
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,440
um so uh yeah i i he was bringing up a

964
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,880
great point about

965
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,400
to mash if you want a mash if you don't

966
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,839
have a food processor if you have a

967
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,320
potato masher or something like that get

968
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,240
your san marzano's in there and then you

969
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,680
could even just take a potato masher and

970
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,359
just mash down those

971
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,800
those tomatoes to kind of get them to

972
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,640
break apart if you if you like that or

973
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,079
if you like a chunkier gravy you know

974
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,040
you can

975
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,400
just leave them in there and they'll

976
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,640
stew apart i mean they will this this

977
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,480
reduces for like four hours and this

978
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,359
will

979
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,359
this can this can really become

980
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,119
something special

981
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,000
yeah i usually do i'll do uh four cans

982
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,920
with the immersion blender and then one

983
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,920
can just by hand you know just break

984
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,440
them up by hand so that you get some of

985
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,000
the tomato chunkiness in there um

986
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,680
yeah there's not it's not a ton of

987
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,160
variation on how this goes down you know

988
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,640
uh that i think uh you know families

989
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,720
across uh across

990
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,119
yeah the united states whenever they

991
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,960
learned how to make sunday sauce like

992
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,760
american italian sunday sauce um you

993
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,440
know this is kind of how it goes and

994
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,240
it's not you know in in italy they don't

995
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,400
leave the garlic in you know i put the

996
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,079
garlic in i leave it there it's part of

997
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,560
the sauce right in italy they just put

998
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,960
