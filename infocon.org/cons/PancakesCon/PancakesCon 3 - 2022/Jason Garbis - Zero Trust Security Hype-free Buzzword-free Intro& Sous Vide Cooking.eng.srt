1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,639
sous-vide is the art of letting your

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,960
food come just to that perfect

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,879
temperature over time

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,800
but how do we mesh that with the

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,200
half-baked nature that typically is zero

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,200
trust jason

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,320
we saved the best for last

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,199
great

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,880
thanks bryson and uh thanks to all of

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,960
you for attending and thanks to leslie

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,800
and team for putting this event together

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,400
it's uh it's amazing it came together so

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,480
quickly and it's really been pretty

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,880
incredible what um what we've been able

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,880
to uh to do and uh some of the

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,238
presentations that i've seen so let's go

17
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,000
ahead and dive in um

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,760
we're gonna talk about sous-vide cooking

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,480
and its connection uh somewhat tenuous

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
perhaps to uh to zero trust security and

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,600
the goal here really is to introduce you

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
to this major concept that's going on

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,760
this major trend in information security

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,320
called zero trust and to try it back to

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,719
try to tie it back to reality and it

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,399
like many things in our industry it's

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,680
become a buzzword and has become abused

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,199
and overused and i want to try to

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,440
provide some foundations to put in place

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,680
here around what it is what it isn't and

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,879
why it's meaningful and why it's

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,439
important for us to uh to do that

33
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,760
so let's um go ahead

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,840
and talk about me so i uh i work for a

35
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,360
company called appgate my role as chief

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,600
product officer uh which means i run

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,280
product management i set the product

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,640
roadmap i spend a lot of time working

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,560
with our customers and prospects i also

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,000
have a volunteer role with a group

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,080
called the cloud security alliance where

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,479
i'm co-chair of the working group called

43
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,880
the sdp zero trust working group and i

44
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,360
recently wrote a book about zero trust

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,520
that you can see there um more

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,799
importantly or the other side of my

47
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,799
personalities i love to cook you can see

48
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,960
me here with some parker house rolls and

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
with some wings on the smoker uh i

50
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,479
couldn't find a photo of myself actually

51
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,560
so eating but i do do that a lot uh

52
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,920
cooking's really important to me and my

53
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,079
family something i grew up doing uh with

54
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,240
my parents and uh i really love doing it

55
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,479
with my wife and daughters and uh i

56
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,720
encourage you to uh to embrace it and

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,600
enjoy it as well

58
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,680
professionally i've been working for uh

59
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,200
software companies my whole career about

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,600
over 30 years in a variety of roles i

61
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
started out with about

62
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,040
seven ten years doing software

63
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,639
engineering building distributed systems

64
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,959
and network applications and middleware

65
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,640
their brief stint in technical

66
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,800
consulting and then really spent the

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,440
last good 15 plus years in product

68
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,720
management

69
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,520
really focusing on information security

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,840
with an emphasis on identity management

71
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
and network security for about the last

72
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,720
10 years

73
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,360
so zero trust is as i mentioned it's

74
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,280
been abused um in the last couple of

75
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,360
years it's a major shift and trend in

76
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
our industry and they're definitely

77
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,160
i would say skeptics uh healthy skeptics

78
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,920
and some cynics out there about this and

79
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,680
there's memes like this that are going

80
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,840
about where people say well zero trust

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,440
is nothing more than multi-factor

82
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,519
authentication and network segmentation

83
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,560
and the principle of least privilege and

84
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,239
i don't understand all the hype and the

85
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,640
reality is of course that the zero trust

86
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,000
there is a lot of hype around it but

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,560
it's also a very substantial and in my

88
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,480
mind a very significant shift in how

89
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,200
we're thinking about and architecting

90
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,760
and approaching information security in

91
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,840
our enterprises and of course it uses

92
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
mfa and network segmentation and

93
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,760
embraces the principle of least

94
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,120
privilege

95
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,440
but it also builds on them and utilizes

96
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,120
and consolidates or integrates them in

97
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,720
pretty novel and interesting ways

98
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,000
really i think the right way to think

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,879
about it is that zero trust is a

100
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,120
security philosophy a set of principles

101
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,760
or tenets and a way that can and should

102
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,360
influence our thinking

103
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,480
if we think about

104
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,560
how poorly our enterprises are doing

105
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,799
that defending themselves against

106
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,400
attackers both criminal and nation state

107
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
it's clear that there's some significant

108
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,560
problems in our industry that we have to

109
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,720
do a better job of address addressing

110
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,319
and i really believe that

111
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,720
the principles of xero trust when done

112
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,560
properly in an enterprise make them much

113
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,400
much more resilient to these types of

114
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,560
attacks um and

115
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,680
hopefully what i will do in this

116
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,439
presentation is communicate to you some

117
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,360
of that substance gets you excited about

118
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,920
learning on learning it and helping you

119
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,080
to help your enterprise go down this

120
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,400
journey towards a much better a much

121
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
better place

122
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,959
this uh this diagram here comes from

123
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,519
gartner the consulting industry analyst

124
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,839
group and it kind of outlines roughly

125
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,199
the general

126
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,000
uh life cycle of a term or a trend in

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
our industry where something happens to

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,479
start it out and then you get a great

129
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,919
deal of hype what they call the peak of

130
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,560
inflated expectations and then of course

131
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,800
things get over hyped it's harder than

132
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,400
the marketers promise and you enter the

133
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,479
trough of disillusionment and ultimately

134
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
it'll get up to the plateau of

135
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,840
productivity and this is not an exact

136
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,840
science and i couldn't exactly tell you

137
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,919
where zero trust is on this thing or

138
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,840
even the shape if the shape of the graph

139
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,199
really applies

140
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,120
but there's certainly a great deal of

141
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
hype around it but there's also real

142
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,759
world enterprises that are using this

143
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,479
and making significant benefits

144
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,720
to obtaining significant benefits from a

145
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,880
security and efficiency and a user

146
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,680
experience perspective

147
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
so of course we have to ask ourselves

148
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,000
all right why why why are we doing this

149
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
and

150
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,240
in order to explain other than bemoan

151
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,759
the state of information security i

152
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,199
think it's important to to think about

153
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,680
things a certain way which is

154
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,600
from a network perspective our core

155
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,840
networking technology from when this was

156
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,280
invented in the 1960s and 1970s the the

157
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
principle of networking is all about

158
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,560
let's make it really easy for these

159
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
devices to connect to one another let's

160
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,160
make it really easy for our packets to

161
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,479
get from point a to point b

162
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,080
and i think we all agree our networks

163
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,320
have done a fabulous job at that there's

164
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,520
there's a

165
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,400
a little history of uh of networking and

166
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,919
security i'll give you a reference later

167
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,160
from uh from the washington post that uh

168
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,639
is really fascinating it talks about uh

169
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,039
the founders and the pioneers of of this

170
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,960
technology in the 60s and 70s and how

171
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,880
that how they did this and they did a

172
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,479
fabulous job with what was very

173
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,800
primitive technology at the time

174
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,120
the challenge we have is that from a

175
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,199
security perspective

176
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,960
what we're trying to do is protect and

177
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,639
control access to applications and the

178
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,800
data in those applications and

179
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,600
the

180
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,039
number one we want to restrict access

181
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,520
there but number two the very vocabulary

182
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,759
is completely different it's how do i

183
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,919
only let authorized people access

184
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,280
authorized data

185
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,120
and you can see we're not even using the

186
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,199
same words we're talking about people

187
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,800
and data up at the top and we're talking

188
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,680
about devices and packets at the bottom

189
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,880
and this gap underlies a great deal of

190
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,960
problem in our industry it's a semantic

191
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,800
app but it's also a technical gap

192
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,840
because

193
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,440
if you look at how most enterprises and

194
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,319
their networks and their it and security

195
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,720
tools and teams are set up you've got

196
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,440
very often a networking team that solves

197
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,800
the problems at the bottom and you have

198
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,639
a security and application data and

199
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,479
compliance team that's trying to solve

200
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,360
the problems at the top and they

201
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,280
because these are orthogonal in many

202
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,280
ways it has resulted in in bad practices

203
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,800
and resulted in our enterprises that are

204
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
very have a very weak security stance

205
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,880
and we see the we see the results from

206
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,800
that but the good news is that we can by

207
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,199
looking at this fabulous stock photo um

208
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,199
learn a couple of things from this gap

209
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,280
so the first is that we fundamentally

210
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,840
have to understand that tcpip is a

211
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,240
really weak foundation for security

212
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,599
because it's built on this notion of

213
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,080
implicit trust it operates on the idea

214
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,039
of connect first and authenticate sec

215
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,639
and if you look at even all the way down

216
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,199
to the networking proto protocol that

217
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,560
you've got a system that's sitting

218
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
across a network from you whether it's a

219
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,599
lan or the internet it has an open port

220
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,680
what that means is you can send the

221
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,440
first part of a tcp

222
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,280
connection handshake a sin and it'll

223
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
respond to you back with the synap and

224
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,440
say great you can connect to me so all

225
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
the resources on the network are visible

226
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,599
and it's only after you set up some sort

227
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,280
of network connection at the network

228
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,800
layer

229
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,680
that

230
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,199
then you have some sort of

231
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,639
authentication today this usually

232
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,520
happens at an application level like ssh

233
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,280
login or maybe in a web application

234
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,360
and that's really backwards from how you

235
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,520
would want things today if you look at

236
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,800
all of these weaknesses and all these

237
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,960
vulnerabilities that

238
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,800
are taken advantage of by criminals and

239
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,199
nation states because these services are

240
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,360
exposed to them on the internet um

241
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
that's exactly backward from how you'd

242
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,440
want to do it given what we know today

243
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,440
the second issue is that tcp icp is a

244
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,759
very poor or has a very poor policy

245
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,599
language what i mean by that is it

246
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,520
forces us to use

247
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
these very crude network-centric

248
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,679
terminology to basically

249
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,599
ask and answer the question

250
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,200
should this source ip address here this

251
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,679
192 address get access to this target

252
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,000
address and port this 10.5 address over

253
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,519
here and the answer is again it's we're

254
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,200
forced to answer it as either a yes or

255
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,839
no an allow or a block and

256
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,000
that's not a very good answer either so

257
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
the end result of this is that our

258
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,000
networking team who is often so busy

259
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
making sure the network is up and that

260
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,040
our packets can get efficiently from

261
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,440
point a to point b have no notion or no

262
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,200
capability to tie

263
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,360
that very impoverished policy language

264
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,680
of source ip and target ip to what the

265
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
application and the data

266
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,240
owners care about which is people and

267
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,519
identities and types of data so we end

268
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,000
up with these very broad and wide open

269
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,240
flat networks where when you get onto a

270
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,080
corporate network whether it's through a

271
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,160
vpn or when we were going to the office

272
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,320
you'd plug in or get on the wi-fi and

273
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,240
you would have access to hundreds or

274
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,760
potentially thousands of services

275
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,120
running on that network and you really

276
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
only needed five or 10 or 20 to do your

277
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,800
job and that

278
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,560
of course violates security best

279
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,399
practices and violates this principle of

280
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,399
least privilege and we see this time and

281
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,560
time again getting used uh very

282
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,800
effectively by by malicious actors to

283
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,000
exploit

284
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,600
and to take advantage of this and to

285
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,760
just cause lots of problems in our our

286
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,640
organizations um and this is because our

287
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,160
network teams kind of give up they say

288
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,959
well i have no idea who is coming in

289
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,040
under what i p address i'm just going to

290
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,279
do my job and get the network is

291
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,880
connected and i'm going to rely on

292
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,120
authentication at the application layer

293
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,440
and that's a very ineffective uh

294
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,920
ineffective security stance uh

295
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,240
given given where we are today

296
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,320
so this notion of zero trust came about

297
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,040
in about the last 10 or 12 years and in

298
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,480
the past few years i would say two to

299
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,880
three years it's really gained

300
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,399
a high degree of visibility and

301
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,240
prominence

302
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
so the national institutes of standards

303
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,920
and technology here in the u.s published

304
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,839
a document called uh special publication

305
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,040
800-207 and

306
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,959
it's a very good document i recommend

307
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,079
you take a look at it it's freely

308
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,480
available um and they defined zero trust

309
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,880
as set of excuse me a

310
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,600
set of cyber security paradigms that

311
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,440
move defenses from

312
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
static and network-based perimeters to a

313
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,680
focus on users and assets and resources

314
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,839
and you can see what this is is

315
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,600
starting to address that semantic gap

316
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,839
where instead of modeling access based

317
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,120
on ip addresses or a hard perimeter

318
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,680
the the classical castle wall around our

319
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,440
enterprise we actually now have to work

320
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,279
with these objects around identities and

321
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,040
users and the assets and the resources

322
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
that are being that are being accessed

323
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,200
it's an important and significant shift

324
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
it's one of one of the key elements of

325
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,240
zero trust

326
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,920
the second definition of zero trust

327
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,040
comes from um

328
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,519
the noted cyber security expert

329
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,519
president joe biden

330
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,000
he issued a executive order in may of

331
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,360
2021

332
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,720
and it was pretty important pretty

333
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,760
impactful on the u.s government codified

334
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,000
both the definition of zero trust but it

335
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,320
also gave a mandate to the u.s federal

336
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,800
government agencies to embark on a

337
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,720
pretty aggressive mission to define zero

338
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,880
trust type architectures and to invest

339
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,160
in them

340
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,120
um

341
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
and there this is

342
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,079
this uh

343
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,480
order defines zero trust as a security

344
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,120
model that eliminates implicit trust in

345
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,880
any one element node or service and

346
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,920
instead requires continuous verification

347
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,760
of the operational picture through use

348
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,240
of real-time information from multiple

349
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,639
sources to determine access

350
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,160
so what this is doing as you can see

351
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,920
it's also talking about another element

352
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,639
of zero trust which is its requirement

353
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,360
and need to not be a silo but to really

354
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,720
embrace its role as integrating uh lots

355
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,480
of different elements of the enterprise

356
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,000
both from an i.t infrastructure

357
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,480
perspective as well as from a security

358
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,560
infrastructure perspective

359
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,519
and

360
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,079
if we kind of boil this down to the core

361
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,480
tenets or principles of xero trust the

362
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,560
first one is to ensure that all

363
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,000
resources are accessed securely

364
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,120
regardless of location

365
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,920
and

366
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,839
what we really need to interpret that as

367
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,040
is that no matter where the user or the

368
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,120
identity is that's accessing a resource

369
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,959
and no matter where that resource

370
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,440
resides the xero trust security model

371
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,560
needs to apply there and this is a big

372
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,920
step forward actually because if you

373
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,519
think about how traditional security

374
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,760
happens is you've got a remote access

375
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,839
solution typically a vpn and that

376
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,279
provides remote access and you have a

377
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,639
completely different set of access

378
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,519
control mechanisms and technologies for

379
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,120
when users were in the office something

380
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
like a network access control solution

381
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,320
and those were completely different

382
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,160
worlds and it doesn't make sense anymore

383
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,680
especially as

384
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,079
number one more and more resources that

385
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,839
people are accessing

386
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,600
aren't on premises but they live up in

387
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,839
cloud-based or remote data centers and

388
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,160
two of course now you've got anywhere

389
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,880
between you know 80 90 or 100 of your

390
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,040
workers working remotely

391
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,200
you need a solution that doesn't have a

392
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,120
siloed and

393
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,199
distinct access control model for remote

394
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,839
and on-prem you need a holistic solution

395
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,160
that isn't about remote access it's just

396
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,920
about secure access

397
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,079
the second principle is to adopt a least

398
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,240
privileged strategy and strictly enforce

399
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,320
access control so that's about i get on

400
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,399
the corporate network and i shouldn't

401
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,800
see 2000 services running i should see

402
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,199
the 10 services that i need to do to do

403
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,440
my job and

404
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,959
anything else that i need

405
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,720
there needs to be most likely a business

406
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,320
process around me getting access to that

407
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,920
as long as i can stay productive and do

408
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,480
my job that shouldn't matter to me what

409
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,079
that does is it really makes the

410
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,880
organization a lot more resilient so i

411
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,120
make a mistake i click on some malware i

412
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,040
get a uh

413
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,199
malicious software in my device and

414
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,480
guess what

415
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,720
now that that malware has access to

416
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,959
those 10 resources that i have access to

417
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,279
on the corporate network that's bad but

418
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,839
it's not really bad because that malware

419
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,760
can't do network reconnaissance it can't

420
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,320
all of a sudden scan all 1000 services

421
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,079
on the network look for default

422
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,720
passwords look for vulnerabilities and

423
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,480
start to exploit them

424
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,320
the blast radius of the attack is very

425
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,240
limited just to those 10 applications

426
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,360
and

427
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,519
because everything else that i can't

428
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,399
access is prohibited it can very easily

429
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,240
be detected by our security and

430
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,800
monitoring solution

431
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,240
we've really increased the signal to

432
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,000
noise ratio so if this malware now

433
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,360
starts to do

434
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,720
a port scan

435
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,959
or start starts to enumerate ip

436
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,880
addresses and try to connect to them

437
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,360
it's much easier for either our network

438
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,120
or security operations team or

439
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,040
monitoring software to notice that and

440
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,279
to really be able to respond quickly

441
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,720
which really leads us to the third point

442
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
of inspecting and logging all traffic as

443
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,480
the final zero trust

444
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,880
tenant and this really

445
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,199
comes from this notion of assume breach

446
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,360
assume that you're every day going to

447
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,880
have a

448
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,040
uh compromised device on your network

449
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,199
and some level of malicious traffic what

450
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,880
does that mean from a monitoring and

451
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,519
operations perspective and

452
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,199
because zero trust really approaches

453
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,680
things from an identity centric view it

454
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,839
ends up

455
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,839
augmenting or enriching

456
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,759
network log traffic and it makes it

457
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,920
easier to tie actions that are coming

458
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,399
from let's say some translated ip

459
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,160
address to an actual human being and

460
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,759
their device and makes a lot easier to

461
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,360
track this down and to

462
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,959
to respond to it

463
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,279
so let's take a look at how zero trust

464
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,880
compensates for those two weaknesses

465
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,120
that we talked about so the first is it

466
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,560
actually reverses this order in um in a

467
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
way that makes it a lot a lot more

468
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
secure so zero trust says we're gonna

469
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,480
require some sort of authentication and

470
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,680
there's different ways to do that but

471
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,920
some sort of authentication before a

472
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,079
network connection can actually happen

473
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,920
what this means is that your services

474
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
aren't accessible to the

475
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,880
millions of malicious actors who can re

476
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,639
access it across the internet your

477
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
services will only be network accessible

478
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,279
to your properly authenticated and

479
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,600
onboarded users

480
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,399
uh

481
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,759
across the internet because of course

482
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,440
you want them to have uh have remote

483
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,680
access when they connect you're also

484
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,199
enforcing the principle of least

485
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,959
privilege i'm moving away from the world

486
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,320
of i sign on to a vpn and i see 2000

487
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,920
servers on my corporate network and

488
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,000
we're moving to a world of i just turn

489
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,360
on my device

490
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,160
i authenticate and i can get access to

491
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,439
the 10 resources that i need

492
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,679
the second piece um

493
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,439
i think it's really really interesting

494
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,919
is xero trust enables a much richer

495
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,679
policy language for determining who

496
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,760
should get access to what so we're

497
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,280
moving away from this network-centric

498
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,240
view of source ipa and target ipb and

499
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,959
instead we get to pose the question

500
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,720
should jim have access to our production

501
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,039
sap server that's a really interesting

502
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,039
question because guess what we know a

503
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,280
lot about jim jim is a person jim works

504
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,799
for us jim has a certain role in the

505
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,760
company and we can very easily

506
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,320
determine yeah jim's in the finance team

507
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,400
and he's got this type of job so he

508
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,600
really does need access to the

509
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,559
production server or no jim works in a

510
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,640
sales role he doesn't need access to the

511
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,720
production server and

512
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,280
really the answer to this question also

513
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,559
is interesting it's it depends right

514
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,480
and what it depends on are a lot of

515
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
really interesting and relevant

516
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,240
questions that

517
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,000
are relevant not to network engineers

518
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
but they're relevant to our security

519
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,400
team and to the business and to our

520
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,000
compliance team

521
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,760
is jim's machine patched what's our

522
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,240
current security posture on the network

523
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,840
where in the world is jim connecting

524
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,880
from

525
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,960
those types of things are actually

526
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,799
really really meaningful and what xero

527
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,200
trust allows us to express in an access

528
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,840
policy uh in many cases for the very

529
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,280
first time

530
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,039
and we'll talk about the service desk uh

531
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,880
example in a minute which is one of one

532
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,720
of my favorite use cases

533
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,280
so if we look at um

534
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,039
what a zero truss model might look this

535
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,600
comes from the nist document and there's

536
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,280
a lot going on in here but the key

537
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
points are first of all there's a

538
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,360
separate control plane in the data plane

539
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,840
for the enforcement mechanisms

540
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,679
in the control plane there is a policy

541
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,520
decision point or pdp and that's the

542
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,720
brain of the system that makes the

543
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,679
decisions around should the subject him

544
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,160
or sally get access to the enterprise

545
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,280
resource

546
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,440
the access actually occurs in the bottom

547
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,360
part through the data plane and you can

548
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,520
see it's gated or controlled by a policy

549
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
enforcement point or a pep

550
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,919
and the policy enforcement point

551
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,520
receives its instructions from the

552
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
policy decision point

553
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,679
policy decision point most importantly

554
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,840
can't make those decisions in isolation

555
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,280
you see those eight boxes on the left

556
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,559
and the right side

557
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,760
that

558
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,000
underscores the uh

559
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,320
the need for a zero trust system to be

560
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,480
tied into lots of other elements of an

561
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,919
enterprise whether it's an identity

562
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,000
management system to authenticate the

563
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,880
user

564
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,600
a security monitoring system

565
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,320
a sim system for looking at logs a

566
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,919
data classification system etc

567
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,600
all those things we're going to provide

568
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,240
both data and events for the xero trust

569
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,400
system for the policy decision point

570
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,600
to decide

571
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,679
should this identity should this subject

572
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,919
be allowed to access this resource at

573
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,080
this point in time

574
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,280
and we look at this from a slightly

575
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,520
different view you can see what we

576
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,960
really need what xero trust really

577
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,760
enables us to do is across our very

578
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,080
heterogeneous set of resources shown at

579
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,320
the bottom here a really wide variety of

580
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,000
on-prem cloud-based lots of different

581
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,840
types of technology we could be

582
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840
accessing database servers or more

583
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,919
modern containerized workloads or

584
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,400
unmanaged iot devices all those things

585
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,000
need to have policy enforcement points

586
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,840
that logically and actually physically

587
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,320
on the network sit in front of them and

588
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,400
the identities shown in the upper right

589
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,919
will authenticate

590
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,919
through the policy decision point to the

591
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,520
identity provider and the policy

592
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,760
decision point will look at both

593
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
contextual information about the user

594
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,679
and their device and about

595
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,280
everything else the enterprise knows

596
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,679
about that user as well as events that

597
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,960
might happen

598
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,120
and i'll show you a flow of what one

599
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,559
particular architecture around this

600
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,159
might look like in uh in a couple of

601
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,600
minutes

602
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,520
but this is really the conceptual view

603
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,880
of tying

604
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,960
how the policy decision point is going

605
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,360
to make decisions and have those

606
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,520
policies enforced across what might be a

607
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,679
pretty heterogeneous infrastructure of

608
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,120
lots of different types of policy

609
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,840
enforcement points

610
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,840
the

611
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,440
the zero trust principles i mentioned

612
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,919
can actually be deployed in a variety of

613
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,039
different architectures and there's

614
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,520
about four or five common architectures

615
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,640
that i've kind of

616
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,159
put put in place in the industry i'm

617
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,320
going to talk about one of them which is

618
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,720
the uh the enclave pays model here and

619
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,400
essentially you can see

620
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,799
uh our policy decision point up at the

621
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,880
top in the control plane and the policy

622
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
enforcement point that sits in front of

623
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
what's called a resource enclave so you

624
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,600
can think of this as

625
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,120
the entry point into an enterprise

626
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,440
network with in this example in this

627
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,840
architecture

628
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,679
a bunch of resources that sit behind the

629
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,760
path and of course the way the network

630
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,559
would be set up is that those resources

631
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,559
can only be accessed by traffic that

632
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,240
goes through the policy enforcement

633
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,280
point

634
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,159
in this example the user has a

635
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,320
also has a piece of software running on

636
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,840
their device

637
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,720
many

638
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,280
xero trust systems um utilize agents

639
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
that run on user devices many of them

640
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,640
also have client less options and of

641
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,000
course there's there's trade-offs for

642
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,840
that but this is kind of the simplest

643
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,480
conceptual model

644
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,159
so let's dive into kind of one more

645
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,480
level of detail about how this works and

646
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,159
what i'm going to be showing you is an

647
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,520
architecture called the software defined

648
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,039
perimeter architecture and this comes

649
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,080
from

650
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,919
the cloud security alliance which is an

651
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,080
open and uh nonprofit industry

652
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,400
consortium and um

653
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,320
this is um

654
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,679
going to match the the image on the

655
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,679
previous slides you think about this as

656
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,200
up at the top i have the what's called

657
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,960
the controller which acts as the policy

658
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,039
decision point and

659
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,880
i show one of these policy enforcement

660
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,120
points uh what's known as a gateway at

661
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,880
the bottom and of course in real

662
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,919
architecture you'll have lots of

663
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,320
gateways spread around spread around the

664
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,080
enterprise network and then we have a

665
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,799
user that's running the sdp

666
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,720
or the xero trust client

667
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,520
on their device

668
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,200
the software defined parameter

669
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,880
architecture takes a couple of really

670
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,120
interesting angles to this so the first

671
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,559
is

672
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,120
excuse me that the controller and the

673
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,919
gateway need to be accessible globally

674
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,200
we don't know where the user is going to

675
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,760
be on any given day and they are they

676
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,520
will be accessing this across the

677
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,600
insecure internet so what

678
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,440
uh the sdp architecture does is it

679
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,240
utilizes a basic form of cryptography

680
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,760
and a shared secret to hide those

681
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,520
components on the network

682
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,400
so this is the um the reversal of the

683
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,760
traditional network

684
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,440
connection that we talked about so what

685
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,520
zero trust says is if you're not an

686
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,960
authorized user if you haven't been

687
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,799
properly onboarded or in this case if

688
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,120
you don't have the right secret key on

689
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,200
your device you can't even establish a

690
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,480
network connection to these things so

691
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,840
the controller and the gateway in this

692
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,080
world are invisible on the network to

693
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,640
unauthorized hackers they won't respond

694
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,080
to a ping they definitely won't respond

695
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,960
to a tcp sim so they're much much more

696
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
resilient in that case

697
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,880
what the client though because it has

698
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,279
this shared secret it can generate a

699
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,760
cryptographic packet and basically tell

700
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,320
the controller hey here i am let me

701
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,000
establish a network connection to you

702
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,200
and the controller will look at this and

703
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,000
say yep you're good it'll let up

704
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,400
establish a network connection uh tcp

705
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,880
connection and on top of that it will

706
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,120
then establish a tls connection so the

707
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,799
session is encrypted

708
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,720
and then we actually get the the second

709
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,279
level of authentication where the user

710
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,600
will authenticate through the controller

711
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,159
to the enterprise identity provider and

712
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,840
this is important because now the

713
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,559
controller as the policy decision point

714
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,320
now knows a lot about the user we know

715
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,919
it's jim and jim's in these directory

716
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,240
groups and maybe i can also retrieve

717
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,400
information about jim's device from the

718
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,760
client that's running on there is this

719
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,200
anti-virus running does he have an

720
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,240
enterprise issued certificate etc

721
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,640
the controller then makes its decisions

722
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,520
um

723
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,200
it

724
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,960
will evaluate the policies and make a

725
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,120
determination okay great i'm going to

726
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,919
allow jim to access various resources so

727
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,520
it needs to communicate that and it does

728
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,440
threat through this mechanism called

729
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,279
live entitlements this piece of data

730
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,640
that gets sent down to the client

731
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,200
all right bryson was there a question

732
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,440
uh yeah we have some confusion about the

733
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,000
control plane versus the data plane if

734
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,640
you could cover that again

735
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,120
absolutely

736
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,600
so let's go back to that so control

737
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,240
plane versus data plane separation is a

738
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,400
common paradigm it's used in

739
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
software-defined networking as well as

740
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,480
in lots of other elements in our world

741
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,799
and essentially what it does is it uses

742
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,120
a different communications channel

743
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,240
logically or physically between

744
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,200
the

745
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,600
mechanism that controls the system and

746
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
the mechanisms that's actually

747
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,240
manipulating or transmitting the data so

748
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,320
it makes it it makes it more secure and

749
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,240
it also makes it more reliable because

750
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,360
let's say

751
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,279
this data plane somehow gets saturated

752
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,880
or compromised our control plane would

753
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,279
still be open and available and the

754
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,200
policy enforcement point in this picture

755
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,840
would still be able to uh communicate

756
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,199
with the the policy engine

757
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,640
okay i hope that hope that answered the

758
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,720
question uh

759
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,039
where were we in the cycle so the um the

760
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,360
user has authenticated the controller

761
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,880
has acted in its role as a policy

762
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,960
decision point and communicate it down

763
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,440
to the client the set of resources that

764
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,360
the user should be able to access at

765
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,720
this point in time

766
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,880
so the client now takes this piece of

767
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,760
data

768
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
and looks at it and says okay great i

769
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,880
know i'm allowed to access some

770
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,279
resources that sit behind gateway a

771
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,600
that's ip address b and it will go

772
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
through a similar step of

773
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,919
constructing that cryptographic packet

774
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,320
establishing a network connection and a

775
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,159
cls connection

776
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,159
and then sending those entitlements uh

777
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,400
to the gateway the gateway would then

778
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,120
further evaluate those entitlements um

779
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,080
and

780
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,159
then be able to establish a logical

781
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,159
connection from the client to the

782
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,240
gateway uh through the gateway i should

783
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,799
say to the target applications that this

784
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,960
user has access to at this point in time

785
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,480
and the dash line there represents the

786
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
resource enclave that sits behind the

787
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,080
gateway

788
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,080
the beauty of this is that those

789
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,679
entitlements that get passed down to the

790
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,080
gateway don't have to be fully complete

791
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,159
they could be host names or they could

792
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,440
actually use

793
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,320
descriptive metadata to let the gateway

794
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,760
actually look at the workloads its

795
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,399
environment and make some decisions

796
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,039
at run time based on changing attributes

797
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,480
in the environment so you can easily

798
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,080
imagine for example

799
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,240
um i've got workloads running in that

800
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,000
environment and there's

801
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,919
because i work in let's say a devops

802
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,080
type of world they're continually

803
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,159
shifting in their state they're going

804
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,120
from a dev state to a test date to a

805
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,000
production state and clearly as those

806
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,520
workloads change from one state to

807
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
another the access that different people

808
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,440
have needs to change

809
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,120
and that can be done very dynamically by

810
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,159
the gateway itself and not have to force

811
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,799
any user to make any change uh to log

812
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,360
out or to force any kind of

813
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,640
disruptive

814
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,679
activity on the network

815
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,200
so let's um

816
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,080
take a look at one more picture here so

817
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,360
this is zooming out a little bit and you

818
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,640
can see we've got our still hover user

819
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,320
in the middle and a gateway and a

820
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
controller sitting in front of a set of

821
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,880
resources but what's the software

822
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,480
software-defined perimeter architecture

823
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,080
does and by extension what we should

824
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,320
think about a zero trust is

825
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,120
it really puts the user at the center of

826
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,399
the picture here so you can say

827
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,480
logically i'm sitting at the middle i've

828
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,720
got four encrypted connections through

829
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,120
four of those policy enforcement points

830
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,200
and on now i'm accessing

831
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,120
resources that sit in these four very

832
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,200
disparate environments and the beauty of

833
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,120
this is number one that's completely

834
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,600
transparent to me as a user i just turn

835
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,240
on my device maybe i authenticate

836
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,080
and now i've got access to these devices

837
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,159
into these resources i don't care where

838
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,440
they are i don't have to remember to

839
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,399
turn on my vpn or turn off my vpn and if

840
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,200
things move around if the enterprise

841
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,679
decides to move resources from on-prem

842
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,520
up to a cloud environment again that's

843
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,840
going to be completely transparent to me

844
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,360
the other thing that's interesting about

845
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
this is that

846
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,240
it changes the network topology so no

847
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,640
longer am i required to have a single

848
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,399
entry point onto my enterprise network

849
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,640
like a vpn provides and then have some

850
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,600
sort of

851
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,600
enterprise wide area network to have my

852
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,360
traffic traverse

853
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,159
and go over a fairly slow and typically

854
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,480
very expensive a wide area network like

855
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,880
like an mpls uh it's much much more

856
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,320
efficient for me to have this direct

857
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,520
connection and enterprises can start to

858
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,320
reduce the cost and usage of wans uh

859
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,880
mpls and things like that to have a much

860
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,880
more efficient model like this

861
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,440
finally we're talking about users here

862
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,039
but in fact

863
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,880
really what zero trust is all about is

864
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
about identities and

865
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
servers or non-person entities as

866
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,720
they're called can also be first class

867
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,320
identities in a zero trust system and if

868
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,080
you look at the bottom here you'll see

869
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,279
our

870
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,960
application that's running in one of the

871
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,799
cloud environments

872
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,399
is actually

873
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,240
acting

874
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,399
is acting as a client just like our

875
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,200
human client is so that application will

876
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,399
go through the same steps of

877
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,640
authenticating with the policy decision

878
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,480
point getting some network entitlements

879
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,720
given to it and then having a secure

880
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,919
tunnel to go

881
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,799
through um another gateway to get to the

882
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,120
target resource so this really makes it

883
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,880
very easy for enterprises to define

884
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,960
not just user-to-server policies but

885
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,480
server-to-server policies as well

886
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,200
so let's take a look at

887
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,960
our day with xero trust with our

888
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,679
favorite employees sally so sally works

889
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:52,880
at a

890
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,720
large organization she's director of

891
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
finance she's got an important job

892
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,120
she gets up early and connects in from

893
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,480
home

894
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,880
this is a day pre-covered so she does go

895
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,440
to the office today um

896
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,799
and um

897
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,200
she turns on her device and there's uh

898
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,880
her xero trust client is running on this

899
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,320
so it performs some sort of device

900
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,799
validation to make sure yes there's a

901
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,559
corporate issued certificate that's on

902
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,799
this device it hasn't expired antivirus

903
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,960
is running and um

904
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,519
she just accesses her cloud-based email

905
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,120
and as well as accessing a corporate

906
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,840
hosted file share to download a

907
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,760
presentation

908
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,880
she probably has to do some

909
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,399
authentication along the way maybe some

910
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,919
mfa because she's working remotely

911
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,640
and that mfa can take various forms it

912
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
can be a one-time password it could use

913
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,720
a push notification to her her mobile

914
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,640
device lots of options there

915
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,720
unfortunately sally

916
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,960
clicks on a phishing link and gets some

917
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,559
malware installed on her device

918
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,559
unbeknownst to her

919
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,760
a little bit later in the morning she

920
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,159
goes into the office and plugs into the

921
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,840
docking station because now she's on the

922
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,039
hardwired corporate network and

923
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,320
because she's on the corporate network

924
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,559
she gets access to various resources

925
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,519
let's say she doesn't have to

926
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,279
authenticate again because she had to

927
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,559
badge into the building so there's a

928
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,279
certain level of

929
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,519
kind of trust if you will

930
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,200
that that she gets because she's in the

931
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,559
building but

932
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,399
she only needs access to about 10

933
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,240
resources on the network to do her job

934
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,600
and those are the only resources that

935
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,120
she gets access to

936
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,880
the malware on her device wakes up

937
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,840
because it notices that it's on a

938
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,440
corporate network

939
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,000
just based on the the domain and it

940
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,519
attempts to do some reconnaissance like

941
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,360
a port scan and

942
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,200
because the system in the network is

943
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,840
locked down this is very easy for them

944
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,000
to detect so their security system

945
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,240
notifies or detects this

946
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,399
immediately notifies it and also

947
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,559
automatically quarantines her device so

948
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,080
her device will be

949
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,799
cut off from any sensitive resources

950
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,559
she'll receive some sort of notification

951
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,159
maybe it's a

952
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,600
maybe it's an email or maybe it's an

953
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,120
out-of-band communication like a phone

954
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,679
call or a text um and her device will

955
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,919
only be allowed to access the corporate

956
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,480
help desk on the on the network

957
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,320
telly notices this she talks to i.t and

958
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,000
they say okay well we've seen an

959
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,360
outbreak of this type of malware we're

960
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,840
going to fix it and that work of course

961
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,679
that fix has to be done by a system

962
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,159
administrator and system administrators

963
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,760
happen to work and live in a different

964
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,519
city from where sally is so of course

965
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,840
they need to remotely access her device

966
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,799
now

967
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,960
the way a zero trust system works for

968
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,559
system administrators is really

969
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,960
interesting is our system administrators

970
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,240
of course

971
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,519
their job is to on any given day

972
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,519
log into 5 10 20 systems and fix a

973
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,200
problem on them

974
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
and that's managed by pretty traditional

975
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,360
workflow using a service desk a help

976
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,799
desk or what's called ic service

977
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,480
management itsm

978
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,640
and

979
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,840
the

980
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,200
this enterprise let's say has a thousand

981
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,240
servers and a 500 employees

982
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,559
out of those 1500 systems of course our

983
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,320
system administrators might have to log

984
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,079
into any one of them on a daily basis

985
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,918
but nobody knows which

986
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,839
which device they need to log into and

987
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,119
they don't want to give their system

988
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,599
admins full full uh

989
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,359
access to all 1500 servers 24x7 by 365.

990
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,719
so what they've done is they actually

991
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,760
utilize

992
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,918
a zero trust policy that ties into their

993
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,800
help desk and the zero trust policy

994
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,239
enforcement point

995
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,000
will essentially make an api call to the

996
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,239
service desk and say

997
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,159
are there any open tickets that in this

998
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,639
case bob has assigned to him and if

999
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,159
there are it will actually set up a

1000
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,480
network connection so that bob is a

1001
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,719
network policy so that bob is allowed to

1002
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,639
access those resources

1003
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,800
for the other 99 of the systems on the

1004
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,119
network bob actually can't access them

1005
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,199
it's prevented at a network layer

1006
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,719
because there's no open service desk

1007
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,239
ticket and that's exactly what happens

1008
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,760
in this case bob gets a ticket assigned

1009
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,599
to him says oh i need to log into

1010
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,680
sally's device to fix it because the

1011
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,760
ticket is open he now has a network

1012
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,160
connection or the capability to do that

1013
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,320
he promote desktops into sally's device

1014
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,720
he fixes it he closes the ticket and

1015
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
when he closes the ticket the xero trust

1016
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,640
system automatically gets notified it

1017
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,359
gets triggered it updates his access

1018
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,440
and bob no longer has access to remotely

1019
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,839
access sally's device this is another

1020
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,079
example of how a zero trust system

1021
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,880
number one ties into a business process

1022
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,480
which is really important to follow from

1023
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
a compliance and a good process

1024
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,680
perspective

1025
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,200
and also makes the organization a lot

1026
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,599
more resilient imagine if it wasn't

1027
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,880
sally that clicked on a phishing link

1028
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,640
but it was bob

1029
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,359
and bob had access to all 1500 servers

1030
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,920
that's kind of the mother lode from a

1031
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,920
attacker's perspective whereas in this

1032
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,880
world

1033
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,440
that malware would only have access to

1034
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,040
those five or ten systems that bob

1035
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,560
happened to have a ticket

1036
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,920
for on that given day

1037
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,760
so i hope that that's provided an

1038
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,720
overview of what xero trust is

1039
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,240
and some of the benefits of it i went a

1040
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,760
couple steps down in some of the

1041
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,440
architectures around that in particular

1042
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,040
i talked about the the software defined

1043
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,200
perimeter architecture i do encourage

1044
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,280
you to uh to do some reading learn some

1045
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,480
more about this there are a ton of

1046
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,480
freely available resources

1047
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,760
um

1048
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,000
that uh that are available i definitely

1049
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,760
recommend taking a look at the nist

1050
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,079
special publication 800 207

1051
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,800
as well as a zero trust maturity model

1052
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,920
both of those are available on

1053
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,960
xerotrust.cyber.gov site

1054
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,119
as well as a cloud security alliance the

1055
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,720
software-defined perimeter architecture

1056
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,880
is is freely available

1057
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,280
a couple other resources i recommend

1058
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,720
there's a really good book called xero

1059
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,880
trust networks that came out about five

1060
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
years ago it was kind of the first book

1061
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,320
on this subject

1062
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,640
my book uh if you'd like to read that is

1063
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,160
a uh

1064
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,560
kind of a follow-on to that and then i

1065
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,960
mentioned this this e-book from

1066
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,400
the washington post

1067
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,839
there's one of the four sections of it

1068
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,200
that talks about the history of the

1069
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,720
internet and

1070
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,760
from a security perspective

1071
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,599
google also published a number of very

1072
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,359
influential white papers called beyond

1073
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,960
corp there's about six of them at this

1074
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,760
point

1075
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,320
starting in 2014

1076
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,079
and those are also freely available from

1077
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,599
the google site

1078
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,640
so to recap think about zero trust as a

1079
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,480
shift in

1080
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,400
security philosophy and principles

1081
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,119
and

1082
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,040
when organizations really embrace it it

1083
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,640
can and should change the way they think

1084
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,960
about how their artifact architecting

1085
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,079
their enterprise security models and

1086
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,680
it's absolutely standing on the

1087
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,680
shoulders of giants and building on the

1088
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,000
proven principles of mfa and

1089
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,320
cryptography and network segmentation

1090
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,000
but it's also adding something very new

1091
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,040
which is

1092
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,880
for the first time in many cases

1093
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,960
bridging the gaps between our

1094
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,880
applications and our data and the

1095
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,240
network layer that we talked about

1096
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,480
so now we'll shift gears and talk about

1097
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,000
sous vide cooking

1098
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,079
which is you know slightly related to

1099
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,760
this um

1100
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,079
so sous vide cooking does actually have

1101
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,599
a little bit of common with information

1102
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,599
security so first of all it's a lot of

1103
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,920
fun uh it uses technology in really

1104
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,359
interesting ways that we'll talk about

1105
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,760
and it misuses terminology like we often

1106
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,880
tend to do in in information security so

1107
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,720
let's talk about and uh and dive into

1108
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,280
this so sous vide is literally french

1109
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,760
for under vacuum and you can see our

1110
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,320
classic tattooed chef here um working in

1111
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
a commercial restaurant with a vacuum

1112
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
sealed bag that he's about to uh to drop

1113
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,040
in

1114
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,760
and

1115
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,440
these vacuum seal bags of course to do

1116
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,240
that you need a vacuum sealer like this

1117
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,839
to do it and to literally be doing

1118
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,200
sous-vide cooking

1119
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
and that sealer will

1120
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,119
take all the air out from the bag and

1121
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,440
then heat seal it so it is under vacuum

1122
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,200
and the reality is you don't need to do

1123
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,880
that you don't need that you don't need

1124
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,280
a vacuum sealer or a vacuum for sous

1125
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,119
vide cooking uh and what's happened is

1126
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,040
now the term sous-vide cooking just

1127
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,560
referred to this cooking technique and

1128
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,880
you can like i do use plain old ziploc

1129
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,640
bags here without a vacuum sealer and it

1130
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,200
works just great

1131
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,880
so let's talk about what this technique

1132
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,720
is

1133
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,240
what you're doing in sous vide cooking

1134
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,560
is you're precisely controlling the

1135
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,960
temperature of a water bath using an

1136
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,240
immersion

1137
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,160
heater or motion cooker that you can see

1138
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,560
at the back um usually somewhere between

1139
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,920
140 and 160 degrees

1140
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,359
so pretty hot if you stick your hand in

1141
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,480
it but it's definitely nowhere near

1142
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,079
boiling

1143
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,240
you put your food in with seasonings and

1144
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,000
you can see someone steak here with some

1145
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,839
garlic and some rosemary two of my

1146
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,359
favorites um

1147
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,000
and it cooks for a longer period of time

1148
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,920
and the beauty of it is it's number one

1149
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
very precisely controlled and because

1150
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,320
it's immersed in water the heat transfer

1151
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,480
is very efficient you end up with food

1152
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,200
that is evenly heated throughout

1153
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,359
and exactly at the temperature that you

1154
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,520
want down to a tenth of a degree

1155
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,880
it also maintains a great deal of

1156
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,720
moisture since there's no moisture

1157
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,200
leakage or evaporation now the downside

1158
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,520
is that uh number one it's not

1159
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,200
appropriate for all types of cooking but

1160
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,480
number two is

1161
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,079
the food or the meat that comes out of

1162
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,920
here is generally very moist and a

1163
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,520
little flabby so what you do is you

1164
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
finish it off by sealing a searing nuts

1165
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,960
to make it very attractive and to get

1166
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,440
the yummy uh my yard reaction brown

1167
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,599
crust on the outside so let's talk about

1168
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,920
the components of this so first of all

1169
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,240
you need a pot or a vessel of some sort

1170
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,480
everyone's got pots in their house so

1171
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,640
you don't have to buy one

1172
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,680
as long as you have one that's big

1173
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,839
enough for whatever you're cooking uh

1174
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,200
you're in good shape

1175
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,400
um number two you need uh you could buy

1176
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,640
a uh a plastic or a polycarbonate

1177
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,720
container like this uh some of them have

1178
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,119
fancy hinge lids um

1179
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,480
your choice

1180
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,079
about how you're going to do that you

1181
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,680
also need the bags

1182
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,280
ziplocks are fine make sure they're

1183
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,160
heavy duty and bpa free which almost all

1184
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,400
of the uh the zipper bags are nowadays

1185
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,480
you can also use disposable or reusable

1186
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,680
sous vide bag something like this

1187
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,760
again you can uh you can make them a

1188
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,720
little

1189
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,400
uh you can make an investment or you can

1190
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,760
use your zip locks this the uh dedicated

1191
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,920
suvi bags do tend to be a little tougher

1192
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,400
or thicker than the zip locks but

1193
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,240
they're generally the ziplocks are

1194
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,000
generally fine as well

1195
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,560
the most important part is the immersion

1196
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,119
cooker and uh there are a huge variety

1197
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,040
out there on the market now you can

1198
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,520
spend 100 and get a very good one i've

1199
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,480
seen some that are as low as 60 i can't

1200
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,160
vouch for how good or bad they are and

1201
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,560
of course you can go up to 300

1202
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,200
or way more than that if you wish um i

1203
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,280
happen to own an anova i had it about

1204
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,520
eight years and been very happy with it

1205
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,960
um

1206
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,319
they've changed the model so the one i

1207
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,839
have is kind of between the low and the

1208
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,480
two low end ones uh on the slide here

1209
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,960
but the difference is

1210
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,480
these are really very simple devices

1211
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,760
right they're heating water so you're

1212
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,440
putting a certain number of watts power

1213
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,119
in and you're heating up water and then

1214
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,680
there's a circulator component that that

1215
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,319
spins around and circulates the water so

1216
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,480
the difference really to keon is how

1217
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,480
much power you can see the low end one

1218
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,359
in this particular product line is 750

1219
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:02,880
watts of power and then the medium one

1220
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,560
is a thousand watts

1221
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,160
um and then the high end one which is

1222
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,640
much much more expensive is 1200 watts

1223
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,280
and has a bigger circulator uh the one i

1224
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,599
have is 800 watts i mentioned they

1225
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,440
changed the model and

1226
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,240
i would imagine that the 750 one would

1227
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,880
probably be fine for almost all uses um

1228
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,800
but you know do a little bit of research

1229
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,920
and see and you can see they're pretty

1230
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,720
inexpensive this one's on sale for 99

1231
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,240
and as i mentioned there's others that

1232
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,720
are even less expensive than that

1233
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,400
you can also make one yourself there's

1234
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,880
lots of videos and instructions

1235
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,240
on how you can do it you can take an old

1236
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,119
analog uh slow cooker like this uh

1237
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,240
crockpot

1238
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,079
and hook it up to a thermocouple and a

1239
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,040
little controller device and um

1240
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,480
turn it into a project you know this is

1241
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,040
kind of the uh the linux

1242
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,119
the linux approach of these but you know

1243
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,480
this could be a fun project i don't know

1244
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,480
you're gonna save a lot because you

1245
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,400
probably end up needing well to buy the

1246
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,359
old

1247
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,480
slow cooker and buy i don't know 30 30

1248
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,560
or 40 bucks in electronics but it could

1249
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,599
be a fun project to do

1250
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,520
jason i apologize i gotta i gotta cut

1251
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,040
you off to close it off we're kicking

1252
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,119
off closing ceremonies right now over in

1253
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,560
track one so is there anything you want

1254
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,480
to add to finish it out

1255
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,359
oh dear okay the only thing was um

1256
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,480
definitely take a look there's some

1257
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,880
terrific resources online i like serious

1258
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,760
seats

1259
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,280
you can see the different temperatures

1260
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,200
for the different foods

1261
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,599
there's a terrific explanation of why

1262
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,440
this is safe and why sous-vide cooking

1263
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,040
kills bacteria

1264
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,280
and you can make some pretty amazing and

1265
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,200
delicious things so

1266
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,400
with that

1267
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,560
thank you

1268
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,400
hope this was enjoyable for you you

1269
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,760
learned something

1270
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,440
and have a great day
