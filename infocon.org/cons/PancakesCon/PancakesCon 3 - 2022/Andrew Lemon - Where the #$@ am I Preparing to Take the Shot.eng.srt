1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,879
okay so uh where the bleep am i and

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,799
preparing to take the shot

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,799
so this is a talk on

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,960
a red team engagement a lot of people

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,120
get focused on this is red team this is

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,080
this

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,320
and we talk about the exploits that we

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,199
use and how we set things up but no one

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,520
ever talks to the the younger crowd and

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,000
says hey here's what i actually did

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,279
you're going to see the tools and people

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,400
talk about all the lead things they did

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,880
but no one says from start to finish

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,640
this was an engagement

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,880
so my goal with this talk was to

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,280
give you a step-by-step everything that

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,040
i did to escalate the domain admin

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,399
so who am i i'm the principal security

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,760
engineer at a little company called

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,760
alias although we're not so little

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,879
anymore i've got three locations we're a

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,879
pen testing boutique out of oklahoma but

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,360
we also have offices in kansas texas and

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,719
virginia

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,480
i've got 10 years of professional

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,559
penetration testing experience

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,000
15 of unprofessional unpaid

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,359
the head of reconnaissance and

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,080
destruction alias head of r d my whole

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,520
job is to find

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,000
new great ways to break things whether

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,680
that's through phishing or incident

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,799
response

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,080
taking what we learned from incident

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,240
response and then making that actionable

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,680
in a way that we can use that on a red

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,600
team or a pen test

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,000
and i'm also a magician which comes in

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,920
real handy for our social engineering

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,159
either disappearing things getting into

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,840
things lock picking

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,759
we run the whole gambit from social

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,680
engineering incident response

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,400
physical internal external pen testing

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,960
web app application

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,920
mobile

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,840
if you've got it we'll break it

48
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,880
so again we're covering the

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,680
zero to full compromise

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,520
this is a red team assessment

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,920
i found that most people don't really

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,000
know what red teaming is or actually

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,079
want a red team assessment uh maybe they

54
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,960
want an external pin or

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,119
they want what they think is red team

56
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,840
but everyone likes the word

57
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,160
um red teaming is adversarial emulation

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,680
or apts

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,560
and the thing about apt is advanced

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,239
persistent threat

61
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,760
you can't expect me to be a persistent

62
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,280
threat if you give me a weekend to pen

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,120
test but

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,319
i digress uh we're gonna cover the zero

65
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,239
all the way up we'll go over scope and

66
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,520
then step through everything

67
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
all right so our scope

68
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,200
your scoping document is your lifeblood

69
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
if you don't know what your scope is

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,720
you're out of luck uh you're gonna have

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,480
a real bad time you're gonna do

72
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,319
something you shouldn't so always know

73
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,560
your scope the scope for this engagement

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,319
was we are to gain access to the network

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,000
from an external source

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,560
where to compromise a user account

77
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,720
uh get access to a domain computer from

78
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,000
there we were to escalate through main

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,560
admin and then we were to show either a

80
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
ransomware an apt-style action so

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,360
demonstrate full control by deploying

82
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,120
malware

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
it was important that we had to fly

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,080
under the radar so we wanted to not give

85
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,640
the sock too many things to jump onto

86
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,000
we also

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
needed to give the socks something to

88
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,599
win by they didn't want us to be so

89
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,040
quiet that

90
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,480
there was egg on their face at the end

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,640
but they also didn't want us to just go

92
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,760
in guns blazing

93
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,319
so our initial access

94
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,760
we're going to start by enumerating the

95
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,920
attack surface and what i use for this

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,840
is dns dumpster

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,280
and that'll give me

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,440
their vpn or their ip address for their

99
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
vpn i'll take that i'll plug that into

100
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,840
showdan i basically do that for every

101
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,159
host i find so dns dumpster gives you

102
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,000
every sub domain which is a great way to

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,319
hunt for infrastructure that belongs to

104
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,760
them your mx record and your txt records

105
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,159
as well as your dns servers are great

106
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,360
dns servers are going to tell you where

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,599
things are hosted your mx record is

108
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,799
going to include

109
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,720
their mail servers and then you're going

110
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,120
to have your spf record

111
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
the spf is great because it will give

112
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,680
you

113
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,959
the external range of on-site exchange

114
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,879
servers as well as what mail client they

115
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,280
use so you can see do they use send grid

116
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,640
what are they using to prevent people

117
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,399
from fishing them and you can start

118
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,600
tailoring things around if they use

119
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,519
mimecast i know these are the attacks i

120
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,079
need to do to bypass mimecast to get my

121
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,639
fishing lure in

122
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,160
from there i move on to a site called

123
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,320
leak peak i also use comb which is the

124
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,240
combination of mini breeches this kind

125
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,960
of gives me name and structure of logins

126
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,280
as well as passwords that people are

127
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,759
commonly using so you can see ginger

128
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,080
over here in the corner and then

129
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,360
netbear um dld5004

130
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,199
it tells you where these were located

131
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,479
but it kind of gives you a profile on

132
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,680
that person

133
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,759
um i'm not going to really go into the

134
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,840
spear fishing portion of like cobalt

135
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,880
strike that's a whole different animal

136
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,840
but for the this example we'll say that

137
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
i snagged some credentials i identified

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
the vpn and then it was my time to go to

139
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,759
the vpn

140
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,919
so it was an f5 vpn there was a web

141
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,560
portion and there's a tunnel portion

142
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,400
i wanted to test concurrently

143
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
so i'll test a windows machine and a

144
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,759
linux machine i want to get my windows

145
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,039
box and my cali box on domain

146
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,560
so if i go to the website i was able to

147
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,960
download the deb i was able to pull in

148
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,560
the f5 dev

149
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,840
and then build my tunnel

150
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,840
uh here's where it gets interesting

151
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,360
after we had compromised um the actual

152
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,560
account

153
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,039
and we let the the our point of contact

154
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:37,840
no

155
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,320
um he was nice enough to replace my

156
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,240
account that's like

157
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,960
jay barrett at

158
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,160
companyname.com with an account called

159
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,360
pentester

160
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,280
which i was super grateful for super

161
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,479
low-key

162
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,639
super surreptitious uh one of the

163
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,479
questions i got was how i'm taking notes

164
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,160
for these assessments

165
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
i kind of start with a top-down approach

166
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,840
so i have my i use onenote as my primary

167
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,319
and then i take as things happen i say

168
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,199
this is my initial access so i write i

169
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,560
take my notes i'm going to write my

170
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,840
report so this is my initial access

171
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
section

172
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
here's where i started enumerating when

173
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,880
i hit active directory i actually break

174
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,960
out a whole section called active

175
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,400
directory enumeration

176
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,919
where i include all of my screenshots

177
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,759
with this is the account i used this is

178
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,280
how i did this i'll kind of walk down a

179
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
little further all these screenshots are

180
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,680
actually from that engagement

181
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,280
so everything that you see here has been

182
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,440
sanitized and cleaned up and these are

183
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,400
things that i'm delivering to the

184
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,960
customer

185
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,000
all right so we dropped onto the network

186
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,319
we got in

187
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,680
where am i

188
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,720
so the first thing i'm going to do is

189
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,160
i'm going to take my windows machine and

190
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,639
ipconfig okay where am i dropped i've

191
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,160
got this

192
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,919
10 100 2687 address

193
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,440
but then i've got these dns servers

194
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,400
192.168.50 245 and 250.245.

195
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,440
so i'll do an end map on those we'll

196
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,280
start by enumerating those machines a

197
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,560
lot of times you'll luck out and your

198
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,720
dns servers are going to be the same as

199
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,319
your domain controller and your life is

200
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,800
easy unfortunately for me this

201
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,039
domain was huge this is a

202
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,560
four letter.net company so

203
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,120
there was a lot there was a huge forest

204
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,919
there was more than yeah

205
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,880
so what i had here was

206
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,560
port 422 port 53 port 80 and 443 and i

207
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,199
see that's infoblox

208
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,199
but

209
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,000
what that does is that shows me um

210
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,919
okay

211
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,240
infoblox and then this ip range it's

212
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,000
probably going to be a server subnet

213
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,080
see no scanning options just want to

214
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,280
check the chat

215
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,319
if there was a no scanning option

216
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,919
there are some commands that you can use

217
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,680
if your domain joined and if you want to

218
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,080
join that machine to the domain

219
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,800
i think net ll test i can't remember the

220
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,960
exact off hand but i'll give you the

221
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,560
domain controller

222
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,599
so that's the way that you can do this

223
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,360
without scanning

224
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,240
i also don't recommend these t4s that

225
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,520
will scream to the blue team

226
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,199
so there's this grep b4 open that breaks

227
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,240
everything down so you don't have to

228
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,039
scroll through 255 lines of open closed

229
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
open close just pipe your scan and then

230
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,400
grep for open that dash b force is

231
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,520
anything b4 at four lines before the

232
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,399
word open so that gives you everything

233
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,640
so we scanned that subnet now that 50

234
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,559
subnet and we're looking specifically

235
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,599
port 389 that's ldap you can look for

236
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,399
636 which is secure ldap

237
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,480
in my experience no one ever uses it

238
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,880
everyone has regular ldap open

239
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,120
so we've got this internal

240
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,440
live.internal is an map server

241
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,560
ldap

242
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,240
dc3 dc4

243
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,800
if you did not want to scan

244
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,480
your admins are lazy

245
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
pings and ns lookups are almost never

246
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,279
found

247
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,440
and if you've got dns on domain you can

248
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,839
do the lookups that's why this tab is

249
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,000
important if you can find the dns server

250
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,959
and add the customer's dns server

251
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,399
then you can

252
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,399
use that to do ns focus against their

253
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,880
domain

254
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,360
uh again admins are lazy so if you want

255
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,640
to look for

256
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,880
ldap.domain.com or dc1 dc01 dc02 domain

257
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,760
controller uh it's five pings and

258
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,399
eventually it's gonna tell you

259
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,000
oh here it is

260
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,399
the last one is ws man

261
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,680
this is something i can use a lot

262
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,279
it's going to come back later so

263
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,640
all right so we found the domain

264
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,200
controller now what do we do

265
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,080
all right

266
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,600
we're going to use the run ask command

267
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,800
because i don't have a domain join

268
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,640
machine and run is going to actually let

269
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,880
me put in the user's information that i

270
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,120
compromised and then create a token that

271
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,360
i can then make queries on behalf like

272
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,839
i'm a domain joined computer

273
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,600
so i start by running sharphound

274
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,880
sharphound is the collector for

275
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,959
bloodhound this is going to be really

276
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,880
loud so this is where you have to think

277
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,360
about when am i going to engage this do

278
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,920
i do this at night

279
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,760
do i do this

280
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,040
maybe in the middle of the day where

281
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,720
there's going to be a lot of traffic how

282
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
do i avoid alerting the sock what i try

283
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,279
to do is find the most opportune time

284
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,680
and then i cram everything in at once

285
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,000
if i've got a short time period and i

286
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,440
can't have the option to do like a low

287
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,800
and slow fly

288
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,480
i'm going to try to knock out as much as

289
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,120
i can and give the socks so much to

290
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,279
digest that they can't find me

291
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,519
so we're going to start with sharpound

292
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,040
we enumerate that it goes out to domain

293
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
controller it dumps every session every

294
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,680
object every acl spn targets containers

295
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,120
etc

296
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,760
it drops into the bloodhound

297
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,560
application in kali linux that uses node

298
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,640
4j to actually use graph theory and

299
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,600
build attack paths

300
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,240
so the first thing i do is i take the

301
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,920
account that i have and i just want to

302
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,399
see what gets me to domain admin

303
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,640
what is my fastest path

304
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,959
so i can see that my account is a domain

305
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,079
user

306
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,640
their admin to this machine

307
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,000
which

308
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,839
there's a user that's a domain admin

309
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,360
also has a session on its machine

310
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,480
there are a lot of queries that you can

311
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,600
run in here

312
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,680
uh one example is like find all domain

313
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,279
admins there's an option to actually

314
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,800
enumerate all these as well these are

315
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,880
usually tagged again just to sanitize

316
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,480
and keep it clean i went ahead and just

317
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,880
disabled edge node display

318
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,959
but this will show me every domain admin

319
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,320
and then i can mark these guys as

320
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,480
targets and actually

321
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,000
this is going to be

322
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,399
every non-domain controller that has a

323
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,720
domain admin logged in

324
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,880
so that's this query right here find

325
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,399
domain admin logins on non-domain

326
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,959
controllers

327
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,079
so we have our own principle we know

328
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,079
where the domain admin is all we need to

329
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,600
do is own this box this 82

330
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,160
with a drop in that user session

331
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
and we're in luck because

332
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,600
we're domain admin on that machine

333
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,880
okay so our first foothold

334
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,279
we rdp into that box

335
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,399
we're gonna go ahead and look at task

336
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,399
manager we can see

337
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,920
here's that user

338
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,000
s whatever the domain controller here's

339
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,920
us as administrator

340
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,120
and then we launched an administrator

341
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,440
command prompt so who am i administrator

342
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,079
so we have the option of dropping mimi

343
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,399
cats which would be great but not super

344
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,920
opsec safe

345
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,680
so when i get on a machine i'm actually

346
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,399
trying to just again fly low and slow

347
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,959
this whole attack path uses no exploits

348
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,120
think of it as a really malicious admin

349
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,279
that you hired

350
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,440
most of my team is going to work through

351
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,399
using

352
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,639
nessus and what exploits they can to

353
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,760
elevate up

354
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,279
as i pin test

355
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,040
i don't use exploits

356
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,880
unless i absolutely hit a brick wall i'd

357
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,680
rather just use missed configurations

358
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,519
so we don't want to use

359
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,839
mimikats we don't want to use seat belts

360
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,000
these things are typically flagged but i

361
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,839
had to make some option

362
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,760
so i went with ps exec

363
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,839
that's going to be sometimes flagged

364
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,279
sometimes not

365
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,480
so let's take our chances

366
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,079
ps exec allows us to take our

367
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,600
administrative session

368
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,399
and jump up to system level

369
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,800
from system then we have full rights to

370
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
basically do as we choose

371
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,920
uh ps exec will flag av so be careful

372
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,639
um but you can see that who i am who am

373
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,480
i command i'm system

374
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,560
uh i'm going to go ahead and just query

375
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,399
all the sessions

376
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,240
sir query all the users

377
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,519
so i query the users which is the same

378
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,440
thing that we saw in

379
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,839
the task manager and i see that this

380
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,920
administrator that i want they're on id2

381
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,399
you can as the system steal or take over

382
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,560
a session or inject yourself in

383
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,000
here's kind of important if you don't

384
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,680
have hands on the keyboard you want to

385
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,440
make sure that you fire back a vnc

386
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,199
connection to yourself because when you

387
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,040
run this command it's going to drop you

388
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,120
out of your rdp session and while the

389
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,639
user that was logged in is going to be

390
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,120
logged in a session then or migrated

391
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,959
over you'll lose that connection and you

392
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,160
won't be able to rdp back in

393
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,040
so i'm able to drop in run this command

394
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,240
ts con this is just with again being a

395
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,399
local admin on that box

396
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,399
once i run the who am i you can see i'm

397
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,720
now that domain user and i'm a domain

398
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,079
admin

399
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,760
from here most people will take this

400
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,519
they'll dump mimi cats they'll use their

401
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,720
credentials they'll try to get their

402
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
credentials there was an option for

403
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,399
remote potato

404
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,639
any number of ways to grab creds to then

405
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,880
pivot up to domain controller

406
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,399
you don't have to do that everyone

407
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,600
thinks you have to go right to domain

408
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,079
controller download rsat remote system

409
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,320
administration tools and use a duct this

410
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,399
active directory users and computers

411
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,320
this will let you use the session you

412
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,839
have logged in it'll authenticate the

413
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,360
domain controller you never have to know

414
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,639
the password

415
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,639
from there we go to domain admins

416
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,959
we drop ourselves in and we are now

417
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,000
domain admin and that took

418
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,519
all of five minutes

419
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,760
uh if you say from start to finish from

420
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,680
engagement to domain admin

421
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,160
uh once i had the initial log on and the

422
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,639
vpn you're looking at an hour

423
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,279
i don't know if any sock can really

424
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,880
uh

425
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,279
catch that that quickly and not still be

426
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,040
question themselves especially

427
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,399
late at night your best guys aren't

428
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,519
gonna be there they're gonna have to

429
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,759
call someone

430
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,920
okay

431
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,639
now we've got full domain compromise

432
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,000
so from here

433
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,800
i'm the domain admin i could rdp again i

434
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
try to stay under the radar this is

435
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,360
where that ws man comes back in

436
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,839
uh when rn

437
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,639
so i'll use winrm and evonrm

438
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,040
to get to that machine once i get on

439
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,320
that machine there's any number of

440
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,920
things that i can load with ram i can

441
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,160
drop files so i drop this a dot ps1

442
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,360
and then i execute a.ps1.nt.nts.dit

443
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,839
ncds.dit is the database that holds all

444
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,079
of the hashes for everyone in active

445
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,360
directory it's just the ntlm hash

446
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,800
the method that i'm using here this is

447
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,399
an audit script that i use but

448
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,399
essentially we're doing is we're

449
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,959
creating shadow copies it's just like

450
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,480
hive nightmare but we're going to create

451
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,040
shadow copies of the ncs.dit we're going

452
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,480
to yank out the

453
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,079
registry keys that we need to decrypt

454
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,240
them and then using the secret dump stop

455
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,040
hi

456
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,880
we'll go through we'll have

457
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,519
all that converted with the secret codes

458
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,160
and the encrypted file into a readable

459
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,360
output

460
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,120
so look at me

461
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,880
i'm the domain admin now not only am i

462
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,519
the domain admin now i'm everyone now

463
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,800
with the ntlm hash i can pass off as any

464
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,240
user i choose

465
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,160
so if i had a specific resource that i

466
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,880
wanted to hit like hr or

467
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,039
banking or finance

468
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,119
i can now pretend to be any of those

469
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,599
users with free rdp i can rdp as any

470
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,919
user and then with crack map exec i can

471
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,760
actually move around the network as any

472
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,760
user

473
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,160
let's give the blue team some fun now

474
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
so i've fully compromised the domain

475
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,799
i've started have my fun

476
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,679
but

477
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,760
i've got 1300 machines where i'm local

478
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,000
admin on but i've also got a whole

479
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,840
domain i now control

480
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,799
so

481
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,640
why don't we just go ahead and rein some

482
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,000
shells

483
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,919
so i use covenant

484
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,080
as my c2

485
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,679
generate a payload and then with the

486
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,320
dash x option in crack map exec i can

487
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,919
actually push that payload in that

488
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,840
stager all across the network

489
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,600
so i'm just spraying shells at this

490
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,080
point across slash 24s i would love to

491
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,880
do

492
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,520
slash 16s and slash eights unfortunately

493
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,080
crack map exec does not like that so

494
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,160
this minimalizes that but there's

495
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,919
nothing funnier than watching

496
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:06,640
like

497
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,039
800 check-ins into your covenant c2

498
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,720
server and you're just praying that your

499
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,440
vm doesn't walk

500
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,200
so here you get all of your check-ins

501
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
each one of these is a unique host and

502
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
then we have integrity high because

503
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,120
we're domain admin so we have full

504
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,880
privileges to do everything

505
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,120
the reason why we are moving into

506
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,280
cabinet is we can establish persistence

507
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,520
with it and then do any number of things

508
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,240
we can start doing our amsi bypasses you

509
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,000
can use an mz bypass which is how you

510
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,080
would normally get past the av hooking

511
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,160
and that sock alerting

512
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,919
but instead we're going to use it here

513
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,919
to start loading other things in it's

514
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,240
easier from covenant and i think it's

515
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,080
just kind of cooler safety cats a good

516
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,679
command that we'll use

517
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,919
to safely kind of execute mini cats but

518
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,840
if we do our amsie bypass we can just

519
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,120
load

520
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,720
mimikats directly

521
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,799
attackers have started using

522
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,799
covenant as the preloader because it's

523
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,360
great and then they use that to then

524
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,000
bypass amz and then do a shell loader

525
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,120
and actually drop either an ms build

526
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,960
package or

527
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,039
a dll that is cobalt strike and then

528
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,720
escalate up to a cobalt strike session

529
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,600
so that was the hard way of doing

530
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,880
everything

531
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,640
um

532
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,320
there are actually a lot easier ways

533
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,160
once we had

534
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,400
all the bloodhound queries

535
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,000
then we could start looking at what do

536
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,120
we have

537
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,080
um

538
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,400
one query that i'll use is password

539
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,480
stored in active directory or passwords

540
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,679
not required

541
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,200
so here's an example of a member of

542
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,360
domain admins

543
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,679
password not required is true you can

544
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,919
actually go to any machine that has rdp

545
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,440
on that

546
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,520
click on the password box hit enter and

547
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,799
you're instantly logged in and now

548
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,760
you're a domain admin

549
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,080
another fatal flaw that we saw is the

550
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,520
domain users

551
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,320
domain users had local admin as a first

552
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,640
degree delegated right on 1 324 machines

553
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,559
so even if i was not able to get to

554
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,240
domain admin

555
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,159
i could then use this local admin and

556
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,240
using the credentials that i had

557
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,120
i could dump all these boxes out of

558
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,480
bloodhound

559
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,200
create a file and then set up crack map

560
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,640
exec to then go out and spray

561
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,320
everything across here

562
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,919
and then set up a task that would run

563
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,960
mimi cats or start dumping w digest and

564
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,720
start harvesting credentials i could

565
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,880
also use crack map exec to dump all the

566
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,559
passwords off of that

567
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,559
they'll dump w digest the lsa secrets

568
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,918
as well as the sam database

569
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,080
all right before i jump on the next part

570
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,840
i'll see if there were any questions

571
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,600
ah

572
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
so doing this uh during the night

573
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,400
because the best soccer analysts are

574
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,000
probably not there

575
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
uh how can a blue team do better

576
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
uh rotate your staff don't make your

577
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,320
poor blue team guy work the night shift

578
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,640
all the time make sure that he's ready

579
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,559
to be on the night shift and there are

580
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,640
actually some really uh hardcore blue

581
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,400
teamers that prefer the night shift so

582
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,559
just make sure you have those guys uh

583
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,919
make sure that your on-call schedule is

584
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,960
good uh in this instance i'm not in this

585
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,600
instance in other instances we've had um

586
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,520
the monitoring service say secure works

587
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,440
or whoever try to contact the on-call

588
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,799
person because they don't know if this

589
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,520
is legit or what's going on

590
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,280
and so they will try to reach out to

591
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,880
them and then

592
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,039
uh they're not available and so i just

593
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,000
keep getting to run free

594
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,600
uh there's a question of what is mimi

595
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,320
cats mimikatz is a beautiful tool that

596
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,039
will actually dump credentials

597
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,880
uh it was based on some work i think

598
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
general wiki is the guy's primary user

599
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,480
name i think it's 10 years old at this

600
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,000
point version 3 is coming out but it was

601
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,919
a godsend for pen testers because it let

602
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,480
us dump the credentials either whether

603
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,760
it be sam or nclm from every user logged

604
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,400
into a machine

605
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,320
all right

606
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,760
so we'll jump into the next portion and

607
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,480
then this is going to be an interesting

608
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,960
non-technical talk uh all my hobbies are

609
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,720
mostly technical so it's interesting to

610
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,760
go into one that wasn't

611
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
so this is taking the shot and this is

612
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,000
going to long range shooting so the guys

613
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,159
you see on your screen this is the prs

614
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,880
series precision rifle series this is a

615
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,440
timed competition where you hit targets

616
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,360
you engage steel plates at known

617
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,200
distances

618
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
and you're going to try to see how fast

619
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,120
you can hit them the goal is to be the

620
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,919
most accurate in the fastest time while

621
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,760
rapidly transitioning between distances

622
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,600
this actually looks really fun and then

623
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,960
when i started the talk and started

624
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,720
thinking about the explanations i

625
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,080
realized that

626
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,760
oh my god i'm giving a math class on

627
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,360
sunday morning so

628
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,919
i apologize for that there's a lot of

629
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,200
math in here

630
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
and there's a lot of thought behind it

631
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,400
but it's really interesting when you

632
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,919
actually start looking at trajectory and

633
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,559
parabola to see what it takes to hit a

634
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,159
target a mile away

635
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,240
and before you can shoot fast like these

636
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,960
guys you have to be smooth so slow is

637
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,400
smooth smoothest fast

638
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,640
so let's look at the uh environmental

639
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,919
forces that are going to affect bullet

640
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,280
in flight

641
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,039
so the environmental forces we've got

642
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,080
wind that's going to affect left right

643
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,440
if it's behind or in front of it's

644
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,799
either going to increase the speed of

645
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,600
the bullet or slow the bullet down

646
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,039
the temperature is going to affect the

647
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,960
air density so temperature and

648
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,880
barometric pressure kind of play

649
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,039
together but they're going to affect how

650
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,039
much air the bullet has to push out of

651
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,320
the way

652
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,919
as well as mirage which is heat coming

653
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,120
off the ground which is surprising

654
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,880
you'll actually see i mean even when

655
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
it's 30 degrees outside you'll get

656
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,520
mirage through your scope

657
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,960
uh you've got your distance and your

658
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
flight time we'll cover flight time a

659
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,240
lot because that's one of my favorite

660
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,080
things if you're shooting at target at

661
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,640
600 yards your bullets in the air for

662
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,200
three seconds

663
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,240
and then

664
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,559
gyroscopic spin or gyroscopic drift or

665
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,080
spin drift

666
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,400
so there's this magnus effect

667
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,799
where basically as the wind pushes on an

668
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,000
object

669
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,400
it creates a wing-like effect so you get

670
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,240
lift basically like an airplane where

671
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,320
the air going over the top of the wing

672
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,520
is slower than the air going over the

673
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,320
bottom which is then causing everything

674
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,400
to rise

675
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,520
so there are other forces that can

676
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
affect the shot as well once you get

677
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,440
past the environmental there's the

678
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,159
actual in your hand so first is having a

679
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,000
good grip on the rifle you want to load

680
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,559
into your bipod which is to push into it

681
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,720
seat it firmly against your shoulder

682
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,240
and then you have a rear bag which

683
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,080
you're going to use to squeeze to just

684
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,039
get it right in the sweet spot

685
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,279
you can't jerk the trigger so you

686
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,360
absolutely have to follow the trigger

687
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
guard down and squeeze the trigger as

688
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,440
lightly as possible

689
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,120
your breathing super important when

690
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,320
you're looking at

691
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,960
600 yards

692
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,640
breathing can actually raise the scope

693
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,360
up

694
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,559
one mil

695
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,279
which is 36 inches at a thousand yards

696
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,440
so you have 36 inches of differential

697
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,279
that at a thousand yards you actually

698
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,559
multiply that

699
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,880
and you're looking at

700
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,559
360 yards of differential you could be

701
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,400
missing the target by feet um or yards

702
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,640
just by breathing and taking the shot at

703
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
the wrong time

704
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,600
and then you have your barrel

705
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,520
temperature cold bore versus warmbore

706
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,840
so you

707
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,400
have bore which is your first shot but

708
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
as you're shooting

709
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,080
the barrel will actually warm up

710
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,159
that effects as he

711
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,640
soaks the barrel it'll expand the barrel

712
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,960
so your first shot on a warm boar or

713
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,400
your first shot's really great because

714
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,880
the tight bore as you warm up that bore

715
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,000
you're going to start getting more

716
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,840
spread so if you're zeroing a rifle and

717
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,919
you want consistency and you want to put

718
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,679
bullets through the same hole

719
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,520
let the rifle cool down

720
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,320
and then the last one is angle to target

721
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,400
so if you're straight on

722
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,919
that can affect it but there are also

723
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,080
instances where you will be aiming down

724
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,400
or you'll be aiming up at a target and

725
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,320
you have to take those into

726
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,799
account there's also rifle can't so if

727
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,000
your rifle is straight up and down

728
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,679
you're fine some people have a tendency

729
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,520
to lean in their rifle

730
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,480
and they'll offset the rifle i mean even

731
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,240
five to ten degrees

732
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,400
changes that parabola of that shot and

733
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,960
will make you miss

734
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,480
talk about our equipment so the first

735
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,799
thing that we use is our rangefinder

736
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,200
so our range finder is going to

737
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,120
range the distance you have to know how

738
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,320
far you're shooting in order to be able

739
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,080
to actively engage that target because

740
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,600
you have to know how you're going to lob

741
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,120
the bullet in

742
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,840
our next piece of kit is a kestrel

743
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,000
so the kestrel will measure the air

744
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,240
temperature the air density your

745
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,720
elevation above sea level wind speed is

746
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,279
super important and there are also units

747
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,279
that will take wind direction

748
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,159
so with our rangefinder with our kestrel

749
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,559
we now have our limit our

750
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,080
parameters that we then plug into our

751
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,520
ballistics calculator you have the

752
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,520
horny ballistic calculator and we'll go

753
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,679
way in depth into these but this

754
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,600
ballistic calculator is what makes your

755
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,799
shot 100 years ago or maybe 10 or 15

756
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,440
years ago you had to actually go in

757
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,320
and

758
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,159
learn all these you had to know what to

759
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,080
dial to correctly make the shot and it

760
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,240
was thousands of rounds to actually

761
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,960
learn how a rifle would perform and from

762
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,120
those we would build range cards and so

763
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,320
a range card will actually give you

764
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,840
known values and i'll show you guys that

765
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,158
a little bit later

766
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
so now let's talk about our equipment

767
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,240
a rifle in our bag these are the most

768
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,080
important tools and without these we

769
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,039
can't get the job done

770
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,960
i mentioned the cold bore versus

771
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
warmbore shot earlier

772
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,679
this is my primary rifle that i use

773
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,679
actually i use a bolt action but this is

774
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,039
the one that i like to train with this

775
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,720
is my favorite rifle

776
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,520
hand built by me start to finish

777
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,440
underneath the handguard you have this

778
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,559
red

779
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,320
looks like a heat sink

780
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,559
that's exactly what it is it is a heat

781
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,720
sink so it soaks the heat out of the

782
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,200
barrel to make your cold bore your next

783
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,320
shot

784
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,639
better

785
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,919
your scope always important

786
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,679
uh stock adjustable stock your bipod

787
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,640
that's gonna be your base

788
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,240
and then your bag

789
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
so your rear bag is your tool that will

790
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,640
actually get you on target if you don't

791
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,799
have a good bag and a good set

792
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,039
uh it's going to be rough and that's

793
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,799
where prs gets difficult because a lot

794
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,960
of times you don't have a prone position

795
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,799
that you can then shoot from

796
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,080
and you're having to move on the fly and

797
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,480
those again little variations can cause

798
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,039
some issues

799
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,720
so here's our wind in our range card

800
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,880
so this is specifically for this bullet

801
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,559
147 grains traveling at 2 695 feet per

802
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,480
second

803
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,039
we'll start with the easy one forgive me

804
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,880
for this terrible old stained picture i

805
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,480
had to pull off the internet but it's

806
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,840
the only thing i'd really show you that

807
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,720
would

808
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,000
demonstrate how wind affects a bullet so

809
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,279
while you think maybe you have to

810
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,039
correct a little bit

811
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,360
depending on how far or how fast the

812
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,440
wind is going

813
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,880
that's going to push that's going to

814
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,320
push where your point of aim is this

815
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,720
guy's actually aiming way off target

816
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,399
another interesting thing is when you

817
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,440
get into valleys or you get into urban

818
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,799
situations you'll see that these

819
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,480
ranges and these windows will actually

820
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
change so you may get

821
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,640
at 500 yards wind going this way at five

822
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,559
miles per hour and then at a thousand

823
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,559
yards it goes through a valley the other

824
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,399
way because it hits a giant rock and it

825
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,360
speeds up and goes to 15 miles an hour

826
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,799
you may have to end up doing some math

827
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,760
to figure out where they cancel out

828
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,520
and then what to do from there

829
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,600
so we'll talk about our come up first

830
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,360
and how we actually dial our scope this

831
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,520
is the the old way of doing it so you

832
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,600
would say i'm shooting

833
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,679
500 yards that means i've got to dial my

834
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:20,799
scope

835
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,480
two notches up and then for my wind

836
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,559
i've got wind drift you don't actually

837
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,039
worry about that at 500 yards

838
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,039
and you have your wind speed

839
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,919
so

840
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,640
0.75

841
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,320
and you have your gyroscopic which is

842
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,159
again your jump up

843
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,720
those weren't super important back then

844
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
uh gyroscopic you're just trying to get

845
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,240
close

846
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,679
let's get a little more accurate

847
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
so here are three breakdowns of the same

848
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,480
shot at 1 000 yards

849
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,840
but the only thing that we're going to

850
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,480
change is the wind direction and the

851
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,200
wind speed

852
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,519
so we're going to start with and we're

853
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,880
using a thousand yards because that's

854
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,840
the easiest way to do the math

855
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,240
so with the wind directly to our backs

856
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,440
you're looking at

857
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,279
dialing your scope up so you're actually

858
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,039
adjusting it

859
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,320
eight mrads and mrad is

860
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,200
3.6 inches at

861
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,320
an at a 100 yards or it's

862
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,519
36 inches or one yard at a thousand

863
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,000
yards so it makes the math really easy

864
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,600
so in order to hit this target at a

865
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,880
thousand yards

866
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,919
we've got to do the math for 8 times 36

867
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,760
that's how high you're aiming over it

868
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,600
thankfully you don't have to know aim

869
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,640
over you just dial your scope to the 8.8

870
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,320
and then it's going to put your point of

871
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,399
impact as higher than the target

872
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,360
this .17 will our one straight behind us

873
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,919
why do we have windage that's where we

874
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,080
start getting spin drift

875
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,000
and that's where the bullet is because

876
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
of the way that it's spinning is going

877
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,600
to cause it to curve

878
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,360
in the same way you put english on a

879
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,559
pool ball

880
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,320
it's the same thing with a bullet the

881
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,080
spin is going to cause it to shift

882
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,279
so we're going to move our wind now

883
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,679
and we move it directly to our left

884
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,000
so now it's a crosswind

885
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,399
so at five miles per hour you're looking

886
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,600
at aiming

887
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,039
1.11 mrad c diascope to a one

888
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,000
which is going to be 36 inches

889
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,480
left of the target

890
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,120
and then you see our

891
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,279
come up actually changes as well

892
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,600
interestingly enough

893
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,360
there's a difference between this one

894
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,120
and this one it's the exact same shot

895
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,880
except for the the speed of the wind is

896
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,919
increased five miles per hour

897
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,440
so we have

898
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,519
more windage so that means now we're

899
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,480
dialing

900
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,240
72 inches

901
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,320
left of the target to make sure that we

902
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,440
can actually hit the target

903
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,519
uh so i just got asked are these done in

904
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,480
metric

905
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,360
yes and that's where i'm so upset that i

906
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,480
had to learn

907
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,240
uh the american and the metric system uh

908
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,320
because i get confused in yards and

909
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,600
meters so there's a configuration for

910
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,799
meters and then when you start talking

911
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,559
about feet per second or you start

912
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,240
talking about uh speed of sound that's

913
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,320
also measured in meters which makes

914
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,320
things difficult

915
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,240
uh mrads is a universal standard though

916
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,240
really so there's a i believe it's

917
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,960
uh there's a con a setting so that once

918
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,640
you get to a thousand yards

919
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,960
meters takes into the same easy math as

920
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,880
you would for yards uh in terms of

921
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,159
inrads

922
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,440
but the difference between these that we

923
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,200
actually see is this 8.9 versus this 8.4

924
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,039
the wind got faster so why did we have

925
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,120
to adjust our angle up

926
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,519
and it's because we get the magnuson

927
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,640
effect taking over and actually

928
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,080
affecting that bullet when it's hitting

929
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,440
the side of that bullet

930
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,279
it's then ramping it up

931
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,880
so you have bullet drop and distance

932
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,080
so we'll take a look at 600 yards which

933
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,000
is very close to a mile 1 760

934
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,399
yards is a mile

935
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,760
so at that distance

936
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,399
let's see let's go with 1200

937
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,960
so at 1200

938
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
and we take our 65 creep more this gray

939
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,918
line

940
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,918
at 1200 yards

941
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,280
you're looking at 1200 inches of drop

942
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,639
so if you do

943
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,679
uh

944
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,480
1200 you divide that by 12 you get 100

945
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,679
100 feet of drop as the bullet arcs in

946
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,918
right

947
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
and now i've got to work out my math

948
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,480
so if we're doing our math to say hit a

949
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,359
target at

950
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,040
400 yards

951
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,440
we're going to say that is 21 mil

952
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,640
so that's

953
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,560
sorry 1600 yards 3.6 inches per mil so

954
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,880
if that's 21 mil you're looking at 56

955
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,599
57.6

956
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,000
mil right

957
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,640
so 56 times the 21 1250 1250 uh and then

958
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,800
12 gives you 100 feet so you're 100 feet

959
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,119
aiming over i apologize for that math it

960
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,560
was way easier when i was whiteboarding

961
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,640
it out um so unfortunately you have to

962
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,440
trust me on that one

963
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,000
okay so we'll talk about actually

964
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,280
dialing the scope we'll go over the

965
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,200
anatomy of the scope you've got your

966
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,440
magnification back here

967
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,520
this is your eliminated reticle never

968
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,800
use it

969
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,599
uh here's parallax parallax

970
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,480
is dealing with focal plane so how easy

971
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,000
or how hard it is for you to see the

972
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,079
target and it's actually adjustifying

973
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,880
and making it a little clearer

974
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,560
so

975
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,480
at 500 yards you're gonna dial that to

976
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,079
500 which isn't going to clear up your

977
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,000
image past 500 you dial it to what's

978
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,760
called the infinity setting because past

979
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,240
that it's all the same

980
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,839
here's where i talked about dialing your

981
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,839
mrads so you're actually dialing this

982
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,560
scope so if you were shooting at say 100

983
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,599
yards

984
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,520
the difference between

985
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,720
12 and 13 that's 3.6 inches between the

986
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,640
big numbers say 1 through 10 or 1

987
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,880
through 26 3.6 inches so here at 100

988
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,800
yards you're actually looking at 12

989
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,880
times 3.6 which is some kind of math um

990
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,560
maybe 36 i don't

991
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,320
and then you have mrads over here which

992
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,920
is your actual measurement so you can

993
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,720
use the mrads in your scope to measure

994
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,520
out

995
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,880
where target is you could actually use

996
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
this to calculate where you are because

997
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
there are known things that are certain

998
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,560
heights you know how tall a t post is

999
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,720
how tall a telephone pole typically is

1000
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,680
how tall a person is

1001
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,599
how far apart something is the typical

1002
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,280
length of a car those are ways that you

1003
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,640
can measure it you can even go down to

1004
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,839
the size of your plate if you know

1005
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,920
you're shooting a 24 inch plate you can

1006
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,560
use that as your measurement

1007
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,000
when we talk about our mrads this is

1008
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,280
where i mentioned there's a standard

1009
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,000
configuration for all of them

1010
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,839
mrad gives us a 1001 ratio so at 1000

1011
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:14,880
feet

1012
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,200
1 mil is 1 foot

1013
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,280
at 1 000 meters

1014
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,119
1 mil is 1 meter

1015
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,040
at one thousand yards

1016
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,520
one mill is one yard and at one hundred

1017
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,359
yards one mil is three point six inches

1018
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,760
so a standard single click

1019
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,160
is three points point three six inches

1020
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,800
at one hundred yards and then a full

1021
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,920
value of a turning to the one is 3.6

1022
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,240
inches

1023
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,640
so that's the easy portion

1024
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,480
or so that's the hard part and now we

1025
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,880
have the easy part

1026
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,320
take some time to try to figure out

1027
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,839
where the targets are

1028
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,880
uh these are all 12 to 24 inch targets

1029
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,880
so we have one at like 550 575 600 800

1030
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,720
900

1031
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,720
and then the last one's at 1600 yards

1032
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,599
so once you have that you know your

1033
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,440
distance you've done your math you're

1034
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,160
ready to squeeze the trigger

1035
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,320
see how you did on your test

1036
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,680
so you have one target hanging out over

1037
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,720
here at about

1038
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,839
600 or 550 yards this is 625

1039
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,599
728 856 930 and 1600

1040
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,520
and we're doing this because we don't

1041
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,680
want easy math we want to make it more

1042
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,520
challenging for ourselves it's harder to

1043
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,480
transition from a 550 to a 625 plate

1044
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,400
which makes it challenging these flat

1045
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
distance shoot makes your math easy for

1046
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,880
your corrections

1047
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,240
and you can see behind every one of

1048
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,920
these targets we have a giant mound of

1049
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,680
dirt that's actually two tons of dirt

1050
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,520
sitting behind each target because we're

1051
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,119
looking for splash

1052
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,280
so in the event that you do not see your

1053
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,119
target hit

1054
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,200
and you don't hear it you can see the

1055
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,280
splash in the dirt what you're actually

1056
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,079
hoping for is once you fire

1057
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,160
you have three seconds of flight time at

1058
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,480
600 yards you can actually get on the

1059
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,119
target you can see the vapor trail the

1060
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,800
bullet is vaporized the humidity in the

1061
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,599
air

1062
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,920
and then you can watch it splash on the

1063
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,280
steel plate

1064
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,320
what's even crazier than that is at 600

1065
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
yards you have the flight time which is

1066
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,800
three seconds to hit a target

1067
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,240
but then you have the speed of sound to

1068
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,000
take into account so if the wind's

1069
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,760
blowing the correct direction you can

1070
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,000
hear the ding but what happens is you

1071
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,680
fire the shot you hear the crack at your

1072
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,480
ear

1073
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,040
you watch the bullet smack the target

1074
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,760
you see the target swing but then due to

1075
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,280
the speed of sound like the doppler

1076
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,560
effect and like when you're watching

1077
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,200
baseball you see the person hit the bat

1078
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,560
or hit the ball with the bat and then

1079
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,760
you hear the crack

1080
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,920
it takes four seconds

1081
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,920
for the speed of sound to then relay

1082
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,920
that ding to you so from the time you

1083
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
pull the trigger until you hear the ding

1084
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,040
is seven seconds

1085
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,480
okay that's everything any questions

1086
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,000
you scroll back to the chat see if i

1087
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,240
missed any

1088
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,680
yeah so i've got a couple questions here

1089
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,800
for you um the first one was um going

1090
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,280
going back quite a bit in your talk uh

1091
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,920
so the appropriate tactic rate for an

1092
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,240
actual engagement to avoid alarms what

1093
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,200
do you suggest there

1094
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,560
um it really depends on how stealthy you

1095
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,640
want to be and

1096
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,640
attack one would be

1097
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,560
slow

1098
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,800
say they say two and three is like two

1099
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,240
is going to be the max if you're trying

1100
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,839
to be really quiet even that's kind of

1101
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,079
loud three is courteous

1102
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,720
uh four is one of those like if you're

1103
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,640
doing a whole volume you could get gigs

1104
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,280
out of the network and if you do five

1105
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,760
you're going to saturate every vpn link

1106
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,520
and everyone's going to hate you so if

1107
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,440
you're trying to go low and slow do

1108
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,200
single points

1109
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,680
target things a little more specifically

1110
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,720
and then that tack wonder attack too

1111
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,680
okay

1112
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,359
and then steve wanted to know on the

1113
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,599
other half of your talk um what about

1114
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,800
calculations being done in metric units

1115
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,119
i tried to uh highlight that but we can

1116
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,119
jump back uh

1117
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,960
that's where your your metrics will

1118
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,640
actually translate over so at a thousand

1119
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,760
meters

1120
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,200
one mil is actually a meter

1121
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,000
and then at a thousand feet one miles a

1122
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,440
foot so you can

1123
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,680
use those and kind of do your math that

1124
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,480
way

1125
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,640
i prefer inches and feet because you can

1126
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,839
break them up a little easier

1127
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,040
and then i had a question on uh the name

1128
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,440
of the competition it's prs the

1129
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,240
precision rifle series um you can look

1130
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,240
at around you probably have a local club

1131
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
within one or two hundred miles of you

1132
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,920
where you can shoot out to

1133
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,839
sixteen hundred yards

1134
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,440
you're not going to pick up and be ready

1135
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,480
to

1136
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,880
to train and enter competitions but i

1137
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,720
recommend starting in the club matches

1138
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,839
it's a whole different world when you

1139
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,000
transition from i'm shooting for fun in

1140
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,560
my backyard to i'm slinging bullets and

1141
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,680
it hurts a lot more because

1142
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,440
it's three dollars around

1143
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,599
uh with the particular ammo i'm using

1144
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,960
you can get cheaper but sometimes it's

1145
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,079
ten dollars around so

1146
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,880
let's see another question on how long

1147
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,240
does it normally take

1148
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,839
all my red team engagements and it

1149
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,240
sounds like i compromised domain admin

1150
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,880
with an hour or two of initial access

1151
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,480
it really depends on

1152
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,280
um how good i'm feeling and how bad i

1153
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,319
want to win

1154
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,920
uh

1155
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,000
i do a lot of recon ahead of time so i'm

1156
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,319
going to sit down i'm going to go to

1157
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,720
every speech put on by a presenter or

1158
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,000
everything that i can glean i'm gonna

1159
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,599
listen to podcasts i'm going to go

1160
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,520
through job descriptions

1161
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,200
i'm doing all my research ahead of time

1162
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,800
to actually get as much info as i can so

1163
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,960
if i know that they have a sock position

1164
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,280
open for third shift for the last eight

1165
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,720
months i know they don't staff their

1166
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,520
sock third shift i'm just going to fire

1167
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,680
if their ciso has talked about how

1168
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,599
they've implemented waza

1169
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,319
and iptable's rules to then dynamically

1170
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,040
block anyone that does a an nmap or

1171
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,839
tries to fire eternal blue or shell

1172
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,000
shock then i'm going to be a little

1173
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,200
safer

1174
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,440
we've had engagements that were a red

1175
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,400
team

1176
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,560
because someone wanted one that were

1177
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,720
four hours of work on my part and then

1178
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,880
i've had engagements that lasted eight

1179
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,720
to 12 months where we went through three

1180
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,280
phases where there was an initial access

1181
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,040
uh migrating up and kind of changing

1182
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,800
flags and goals along the way all right

1183
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,560
well thank you so much andrew that was a

1184
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,800
really fascinating talk and uh we really

1185
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,079
