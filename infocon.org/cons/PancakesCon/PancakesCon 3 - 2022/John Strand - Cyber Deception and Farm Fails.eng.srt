1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,720
thank you very much for putting this on

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,200
um also a big shout out there's a team

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,440
of people that are making this happen

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,880
and just nothing but thanks for

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,080
everybody in the background that helps

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,200
this work

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,960
and work very well

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
so this is a weird presentation um i

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,800
guess any presentation that has a title

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,039
of diuretic goats or a part of a title

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,880
that has diuretic goats is going to be a

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,400
little weird i'm just going to be honest

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,680
with you it's a it's going to be a

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,480
strange ride especially at the end and

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,000
as i was talking in the green room i

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,519
usually get a little bit nervous

17
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,120
whenever i talk about things that aren't

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,960
necessarily technical so we're going to

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,399
start technical and work into

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,480
non-technical so i want to talk about

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
cyber deception i fundamentally believe

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,800
that cyber deception is absolutely

23
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,879
essential for any security program

24
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,120
whatsoever if you run across people that

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,399
are like well you should do everything

26
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,480
else right first before you do cyber

27
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,879
reception those people are wrong and the

28
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,520
reason why is because you will never get

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,920
to the point where absolutely everything

30
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,079
is working absolutely the way that it

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,600
should in your organization so that's

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
basically a neat way of saying we're

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,199
never going to implement cyber deception

34
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,600
ever and the reason why cyber deception

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,920
is more important now than it's ever

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
been is because a lot of the different

37
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,080
defensive like architectures that

38
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,479
organizations have are very consistent

39
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,400
you're seeing the same endpoint vendors

40
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,960
you're seeing the same firewalls ids ips

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,200
systems and it's relatively easy for a

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,360
defender to mimic those defenses and

43
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,439
then be able to bypass those defenses

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,960
like seriously

45
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,240
do you think the russians don't have the

46
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,560
ability to bypass silence or crowdstrike

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,680
or sentinel one absolutely they do so

48
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,360
what we can do is we can add a little

49
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,600
bit of randomization and a little bit of

50
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,680
risk on behalf of the attackers and what

51
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,680
they're doing and one of the best

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,119
organizations out there whenever it

53
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,680
comes to cyber deception is uh harun's

54
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,520
company thinkest and they have this

55
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,159
amazing website which we're probably

56
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,399
gonna end up bringing down by having

57
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
everyone go to it at the same time they

58
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,159
have this website called canary tokens

59
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,960
now what canary tokens does is it allows

60
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,880
you to create a number of different

61
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,399
artifacts

62
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,320
that if they're interacted with they

63
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,080
call back so you can create word

64
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,000
documents you can create pdfs you can

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,120
create s3 buckets you can do all kinds

66
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,080
of things now these are really powerful

67
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,560
and they're super simple to use which

68
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,160
brings me to another point where we're

69
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,959
talking about cyber deception it's not

70
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,120
hard to do that's one of the things that

71
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,959
i'm hoping to get out of this very very

72
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,800
quickly is you can implement this

73
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,480
without standing up a bunch of windows

74
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,200
server 2003 hunting pods and then

75
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,040
watching them that's that's not what

76
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,640
we're talking about we're talking about

77
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,560
some very easy components that you can

78
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,599
put in place and there's a lot of really

79
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,200
cool features built into this i don't

80
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,120
have time to go into all of them but

81
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,879
it's just amazing another thing that you

82
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,160
can look at is adhd the active defense

83
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,720
harbinger distribution now this is a

84
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,519
darpa funded project that we worked on

85
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,400
at black hills information security with

86
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,720
secure ideas kevin johnson and his team

87
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
and the idea was to bring together all

88
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,080
of these different cyber deception

89
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,360
technologies into one place now

90
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,319
right now the adhd project is currently

91
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,120
in flux we have one vm which is a linux

92
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,720
based vm that has all the tools

93
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,840
installed on it that's absolutely

94
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,519
fantastic it's going to be updated here

95
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,080
very shortly so you can play with it and

96
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,319
that's great the other vm that we have

97
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,840
is the vm that we use in my pay which

98
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,560
you can classes which is a windows vm

99
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,200
running windows subsystem for linux and

100
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,120
all the tools built into it but for

101
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,879
right now if you want to get started you

102
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,480
can actually go to black hills infosec

103
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,560
dot com forward slash projects forward

104
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,480
slash adhd

105
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,959
download and run the vm there as well so

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,080
let's go through some of the stuff that

107
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,519
thinkus provides whenever we're looking

108
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,040
at canary tokens this is really cool and

109
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,159
it's super easy and it's so easy i don't

110
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,159
know why everybody isn't doing it like

111
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,840
this should be something that is built

112
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,200
into every single authentication portal

113
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,280
that exists what it does

114
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,720
is you take this little bit of

115
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,959
javascript and you embed it on your

116
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,640
website where you have a user id and a

117
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,239
password field now as a pen tester as a

118
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,760
malicious attacker as anybody that's

119
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,319
doing offensive operations knows you're

120
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,279
gonna clone that right so an attacker

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,199
will sit down they're gonna clone that

122
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,519
authentication portal and the reason why

123
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,680
they're going to do that is because

124
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,919
they're trying to create a legitimate

125
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,919
looking website in order to capture

126
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,280
credentials so if you're looking like

127
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
evil nginx or evil jinx

128
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,560
if you're looking at a bunch of other

129
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,000
tools that allow you to clone websites

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,520
social engineering toolkit has that

131
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,840
capability or just some python libraries

132
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,680
that you can do your own cloning of a

133
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,479
website what's going to happen is as

134
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,199
soon as that website is cloned

135
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,600
it's going to pull this javascript and

136
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,960
it's going to check and see if the

137
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,160
document domain is not your domain and

138
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,880
the example here is it's thinkus.com and

139
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,040
if it's not then it's going to reach

140
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,560
back and it's going to try to pull an

141
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,199
image file now when it does that

142
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,360
then you're going to be able to pinpoint

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,440
where that attacker actually is now

144
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,960
we're going to talk about geolocation

145
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,720
based on ip address here in just a

146
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,120
couple of seconds it's not the best

147
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
geolocation that you can work with it

148
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,639
actually works pretty well for our

149
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,320
purposes what we're going to be doing

150
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,000
over the next few slides of this

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,120
presentation but it's really easy also

152
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,039
you can take the code associated with

153
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,759
canary tokens and you can build your own

154
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,639
canary token server so it isn't always

155
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,360
going back to canarytokens.com

156
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,440
you can set up your own domain so you

157
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,039
can set up a domain that's close to your

158
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,039
domain or you can set up a domain that's

159
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,560
complete gibberish that looks like an

160
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,120
advertising domain so if the attacker's

161
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,440
system reaches back to like e23b2.org

162
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,840
they'll be like well that just looks

163
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
like an ad server or something like that

164
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,360
once again kind of flipping the

165
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
psychology on the attackers a little bit

166
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,759
now the question is does this work well

167
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,520
yeah it does so we actually utilize this

168
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
um in a number of different parts on

169
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,960
outside of black hills information

170
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,080
security

171
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,120
and now everyone's going to be looking

172
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,800
for them please don't but yes they're

173
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,120
out there and the goal of doing this is

174
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,720
once again to try to identify

175
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,759
spearfishing campaigns before a single

176
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,880
email is sent in so if somebody clones

177
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,360
one of our websites we can dynamically

178
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,560
block that particular domain um that the

179
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,240
attacker may be standing up or we can

180
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,919
just monitor the situation a little bit

181
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,039
closer which is what we tend to do and

182
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,840
it works so in this particular situation

183
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,080
this is our canary token server um this

184
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,919
is a while back right before the last

185
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,560
derby con and this is just one snapshot

186
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,199
in time and these were active attacks

187
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,360
against black hills information security

188
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,759
and people that were actively trying to

189
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,400
clone our website in order to attempt a

190
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,039
spearfishing campaign against us

191
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,599
once again this works we're always being

192
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,280
attacked and this allows us to get in

193
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
front of the attack a little bit now i'm

194
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,840
not going to go into a crazy rant on

195
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,880
threat intel feeds but by and large

196
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,280
this is really solid threat intel it's

197
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,599
not threatened tell about a website that

198
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,440
was used to attack another organization

199
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,599
a week or a month or a year ago it's

200
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,039
basically threat intelligence of what

201
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,039
the attacker is doing against your

202
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,319
organization right now real-time threat

203
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,800
intelligence that's highly specific to

204
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,880
you so if you're into threat

205
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,039
intelligence and that's your jam

206
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,599
there's different ways right ttp's goals

207
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,720
and objectives are amazing iocs are kind

208
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,479
of garbage right unless you're dealing

209
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,039
with general botnets what you're always

210
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,800
after is you're trying to get the most

211
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,479
on the ground truthful information of

212
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,880
what the attacker is doing right now and

213
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,919
cyber deception allows you to do that

214
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,919
allows you to dynamically see look these

215
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,680
are the ip addresses the attackers are

216
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,840
currently using we can start monitoring

217
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,759
these ip addresses or we can actually do

218
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,759
some type of blocking or shunning of

219
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,919
these ip addresses as well

220
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,720
now word documents um i once had this

221
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,960
idea of completely redoing green eggs

222
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,599
and ham um and doing it all for cyber

223
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,960
deception you know would you run it from

224
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,479
a share would you run it from a chair

225
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,479
would you run it from tor if the fbi

226
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,080
comes should you open the door and kind

227
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,599
of do it that way to get the point

228
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,680
across but word documents are probably

229
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,120
one of the most basic types of cyber

230
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,440
deception and attribution that you can

231
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,800
utilize the idea is post exploitation an

232
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
attacker breaks into your environment

233
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,400
and then they may use some utility

234
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,919
that'll search through all the shares

235
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,319
that are available to the specific user

236
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,159
account that they have compromised

237
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,559
looking for specific documents documents

238
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,080
with words like passwords or scada ics

239
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,159
um hipaa whatever social security

240
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,559
numbers you can create documents with

241
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,040
keywords and put them on shares that an

242
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,920
attacker is absolutely going to find

243
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,800
through an automatic fashion so they run

244
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
this they scan through the environment

245
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
they find the document they open you

246
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,880
could also put it up on your website

247
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,519
like help desk instructions or vpn

248
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,800
instructions or i don't know server

249
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,040
passwords dot dot that last one is a

250
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,560
little bit out there but you can

251
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,320
basically have it be part of your web

252
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,160
infrastructure that your general user

253
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,279
population is never going to reference

254
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,880
to robots. reference it in robots.txt

255
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,800
and attackers will actually go there as

256
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,480
well so there are some things to keep in

257
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,240
mind once again when you're dealing with

258
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,399
this the vast majority of ward docks

259
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,600
especially the ones that you use from

260
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,959
canary tokens

261
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,560
they're going to be triggering based on

262
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,080
ip address

263
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,800
so a while ago um i had my brother who

264
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,000
works at black hills information

265
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,080
security i sent him a doc and it was

266
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,839
like two o'clock in the morning and uh

267
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,519
this was before derbycon the last

268
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,279
derbycon once again kind of feeling

269
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,519
nostalgic because uh i don't know just

270
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,000
them and i was like brian you gotta open

271
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,279
this document he's like i'm not supposed

272
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,480
to open this document this is against

273
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,880
bhis policies this looks weird we should

274
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,560
be doing live testing i'm like come on

275
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,360
brian open the document so he opened the

276
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,040
document now i wanted to demonstrate

277
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,519
what type of accuracy you could actually

278
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,640
get with basic ip address i mean anybody

279
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,480
who knows anything about geolocation by

280
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,160
ip address knows it sucks right and if i

281
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,640
was going to try to get geolocation for

282
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,399
some of my networks it's going to put me

283
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,279
in kansas or if you're downtown

284
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,120
louisville it's gonna put it somewhere

285
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
in louisville kentucky or kentucky

286
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,000
that's really horrible geolocation not

287
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,320
that valid and if you believe that you'd

288
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,720
be right so we were at the hotel all the

289
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,040
way downtown in louisville

290
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,240
and it put us a pin way far away from

291
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,480
where we actually were once again there

292
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,959
is value in this right we know the

293
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,480
attackers are in russia we know the

294
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,920
attackers are in china we know the

295
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,640
attackers are in kentucky right there's

296
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,519
some value there but it ain't great

297
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,279
value

298
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,000
well

299
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
if you back up and you think about how

300
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,480
ip addresses work in general at home

301
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,160
your computer system whenever it joins a

302
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,920
wireless network is going to get

303
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,519
assigned an ip address via dhcp dynamic

304
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,519
host configuration protocol

305
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,720
and your isp isn't all that different

306
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,360
so imagine the isp has this great big

307
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,760
pool of ip addresses and they're handing

308
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,200
them out dynamically and things are

309
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,279
changing over time would you bother to

310
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,399
geolocate those ip addresses no probably

311
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,519
not even though they do and they can you

312
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,200
generally need a warrant source

313
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,160
destination date timestamp source port

314
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,240
in order to actually get the real

315
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,600
location but that's a whole nother

316
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,839
conversation for a different day

317
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,839
so those ip addresses tend to be very

318
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,440
dynamic and they just put them all in

319
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,399
the exact same location however

320
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,480
if you're looking at how ip addresses

321
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,880
work the end ip addresses are going to

322
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,320
be dynamic the routing ip addresses tend

323
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,880
not to be so if you can trace route to

324
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,600
an ip address go to the second to last

325
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,880
hop back up and go to the edge router

326
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,680
well

327
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,320
that edge router tends to be far more

328
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,000
accurate and in this particular

329
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,240
situation it had us a block away

330
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,440
because we were staying at the higher

331
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,760
regency block and a half now that's far

332
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,839
more accurate geolocation on the

333
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,000
attacker this is cool right and once

334
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,760
again this serves as a great trip wire

335
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,040
if it's on the inside of your

336
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,880
environment this is something that a

337
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,800
general user should not be mucking

338
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,639
around with and if they do

339
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,160
you can start investigating as though

340
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,680
the account is compromised that's pretty

341
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,560
neat

342
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,120
now we can do that with canary tokens

343
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,440
the problem is canary tokens tends to

344
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
only work really well

345
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,399
with

346
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,720
word what if we add other

347
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,040
like document readers well you can use

348
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,360
word web bugs and this is actually built

349
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,160
in to adhd this is a tool that's created

350
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,880
by ethan robich and what this tool does

351
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,800
is it actually puts in a cascading style

352
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,760
sheet and an image source tag inside of

353
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,040
the document

354
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,920
the cool thing about this is it works on

355
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,800
obvi word libreoffice writer

356
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,519
uh

357
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,000
microsoft word for mac microsoft word

358
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,839
for windows apple text edit some

359
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,079
versions of apple text edit it's far

360
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,680
more effective as far as what it

361
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,920
actually pulls up which is pretty cool

362
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,440
the other thing i would encourage all of

363
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,959
you to do you can sprinkle these

364
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,800
documents liberally throughout your own

365
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,040
environment once again no great risk we

366
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,120
aren't hacking back we we aren't doing

367
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,000
anything that requires a seismic change

368
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,320
to our infrastructure so far it's no big

369
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
whoop stand up the server sprinkle up

370
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,240
some documents sit back and wait for the

371
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
alerts to come in the other thing you

372
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,160
can do is if you go back to the miter

373
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,320
attack technique matrix there's a lot of

374
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,079
techniques there one of the things the

375
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,000
miter attack technique matrix doesn't do

376
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,519
as well as i would like it to do is

377
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,240
frequency how often are certain attack

378
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,880
techniques utilized versus others

379
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,360
so one of the attack techniques that

380
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,600
attackers use all the time is password

381
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,920
spraying post exploitation running net

382
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,240
user space forward slash domain dumping

383
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,839
all of the users from the environment

384
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,920
and then doing a password spray with

385
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
power shell or a for loop from the

386
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,480
command line to try each one of those

387
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,440
user ids indiscriminately

388
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,800
with a given password let's say a

389
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,639
password of winter 2022 or pancake on

390
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,320
2022 because some people might have that

391
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,160
for their password as well so they'll

392
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,800
try to use that single password

393
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,279
against all of these user accounts well

394
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,760
something you can do next monday or

395
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,760
tuesday if monday is a holiday for you

396
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,240
is you can set up an account i use an

397
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,040
example of admin admin administrator you

398
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,959
don't have to do that you can name it

399
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,199
anything just create an account so

400
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,639
you're going to create an account give

401
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,839
it a really long password log into the

402
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,680
account if you don't log into the

403
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,199
account it's going to set the last login

404
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,560
time as january 1st 1601 which is epoch

405
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,959
time for active directory authentication

406
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,399
and that's has something to do with the

407
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,560
gregorian calendar and we aren't going

408
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,320
to get into that but at any rate it's a

409
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,800
zero time nothing in it and that goes

410
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,279
back to epoch time so log into it so it

411
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,639
gets rid of that apoc time because

412
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,120
that's a dead giveaway that this is a

413
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,560
honeypot account or an account that's

414
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,120
never been logged into so log in give it

415
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,000
a really long password set its logon

416
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,360
hours to zero it's a way of disabling

417
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,600
account without actually disabling the

418
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,360
account because some of the attacker

419
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,800
tools will go through and identify

420
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
disabled accounts and won't even try

421
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,639
authenticating we want the attacker to

422
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,480
authenticate or at least attempt to so

423
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,639
now you set up a rule in your sim that

424
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,360
if somebody tries to authenticate alert

425
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,519
immediately once again threat

426
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,040
intelligence about what's happening in

427
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,920
your environment right now

428
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,000
also curb roasting you can do this with

429
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,079
service accounts as well

430
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,320
um we we have a number of tools that we

431
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
need to update at black hills

432
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,120
information security and this is one

433
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,320
called the cred defense toolkit

434
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,399
written by a number of bhis employees we

435
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,399
do need to update but it allows you to

436
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,480
create fake kerberostable accounts i

437
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,000
guess they are service accounts not

438
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,240
really fake but whenever their attempt

439
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,320
if there's an attempt to access them

440
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,560
it'll generate an alert once again post

441
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,920
exploitation

442
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
any attacker worth their salt is going

443
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,120
to do a password spray and they're going

444
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,040
to attempt to do curb roasting they may

445
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,279
try to do it low and slow

446
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,800
it doesn't matter you're still going to

447
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,279
be able to detect them easy peasy set

448
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,279
this up run it in your environment

449
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,240
please it's super simple doesn't require

450
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
a lot of overhead and yeah you can

451
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,600
probably get it done in the next couple

452
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
of days and we love putting this in our

453
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,959
reports of black hills information

454
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,120
security effective use of traps

455
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,320
multiples in this environment were

456
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,079
installed as traps activities conducted

457
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,279
reveals that these were vulnerable to

458
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,759
multiple insecurities i love it and one

459
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,360
of my favorite quotes is i love it when

460
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,839
testers cry i collect their tears it

461
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,759
makes the best wine

462
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,120
the other tool that we have is one

463
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,959
called honey badger this is originally

464
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,440
created by tim tomes and we forked it

465
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
bradley has forked it recently and this

466
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,079
generates a whole bunch of vb that went

467
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,079
over the document usually an excel

468
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,759
spreadsheet which can also do a word

469
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,079
document is fired it's going to run a

470
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,560
powershell command the powershell netsh

471
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,600
wlan show networks mode the ssid

472
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,480
and it's going to find the um the mac

473
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,959
addresses uh not mac address the bssids

474
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,640
which is the mac address a whole bunch

475
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,480
of wireless networks and then it's going

476
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,839
to submit that up to google and then

477
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,839
google is going to send you the latitude

478
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,079
and longitude usually within like 20

479
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,400
meters of where that system is now

480
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,319
there's no obfuscation in this you're

481
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,599
going to have to come up with some level

482
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,520
of obfuscation

483
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,439
to make this get by some endpoint

484
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,280
protection products but the concept

485
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,679
works really well an attacker pulls down

486
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,919
a spreadsheet they open it they expect

487
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,320
macros because there's macros in excel

488
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,240
spreadsheets all the time and bang

489
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
you've got geolocation very very close

490
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
to where the attacker is

491
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,000
just compile it and run it you're ready

492
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,320
to go this is the same thing running and

493
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,559
it put us at the marriott within 77

494
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,760
meters which is pretty darn close so my

495
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,360
goal of all of this is to try to get you

496
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,799
all familiar with cyber deception and

497
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,799
not be afraid of it don't look at it as

498
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,280
some type of ooh that might be illegal

499
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,919
or we might get arrested stop that's not

500
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,440
the way to think that's not the way to

501
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
live the other way that people say is we

502
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,400
don't want to anger the attackers yes we

503
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,640
do we don't want to be in a situation in

504
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,559
computer security where we're so bad at

505
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,400
being a victim that we're like let's not

506
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,480
anger them so they don't hurt us more

507
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,160
they don't care they're still going to

508

hour four hours so you get time to

526
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,520
actually digest what we're talking about

527
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,360
all right let's move on and let's talk

528
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,799
about cows

529
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,480
dog collars

530
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,880
and hail all right so this particular

531
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,640
picture um i want to talk a little bit

532
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,559
about some farm fails and there's a

533
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,160
reason for all of this and i'll get to

534
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,360
that at the end

535
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
that wonderful baby calf that you see

536
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,360
there um that particular calf was born

537
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,760
in the summertime actually early spring

538
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,720
and

539
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,640
mama is proud and sitting over the baby

540
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,080
calf which is great

541
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,880
well this picture was taken because my

542
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,280
wife and i were running around trying to

543
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,160
find that baby calf and we were having a

544
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,720
hard time finding that baby cat

545
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,240
and the reason why we were trying to

546
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,640
find that baby calf is because a massive

547
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,720
hail storm was rolling through

548
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
and we wanted to go get the baby calf

549
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,240
and get the baby calf and mama under

550
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,120
shelter um before the hail storm came

551
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,520
through and so i was gonna go find this

552
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,840
calf my wife found it took a picture

553
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,280
send it to her told her where i was at

554
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,600
she came down i actually almost stepped

555
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,919
on the baby cow whenever a calf is born

556
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,760
if they drop down and they curl up into

557
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,919
a ball they're actually really hard to

558
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,039
see and that's what he was doing so

559
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,400
what do you do if you have a baby cat

560
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,159
that has decided just to lay there and

561
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,880
not move around again a very very young

562
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,320
calf i think within 24 hours old

563
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,679
so

564
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,240
i did what anybody would do i decided

565
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,520
that

566
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,440
i was going to put a dog collar on the

567
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,520
calf with the leash and try to get the

568
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,880
baby calf to get up and

569
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,039
like go with us to safety from the

570
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,520
massive thunderstorm that's coming over

571
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,760
the ridge you know thunder and lightning

572
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,919
and all this stuff so i put the collar

573
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,760
on the cap which once again

574
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,400
totally weird i know that now people

575
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
think it's dumb they're right

576
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,679
and this baby calf would not get up

577
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,240
this baby cap immediately started like

578
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
like just screaming bloody murder as

579
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,400
soon as i tried to pull on him and all

580
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,120
of a sudden mama and the entire herd

581
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,600
just comes like barreling down now as

582
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,679
soon as they start barreling down the

583
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,919
thunderstorm hits and it starts raining

584
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,200
and hail

585
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
monster hail just starts coming out and

586
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,039
he's pouting my wife and i and we're

587
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,280
like we've got to get this baby calf to

588
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,640
safety so i pick up the baby cap and i

589
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,400
start walking with this baby calf leg

590
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,159
straight down holding in like this and

591
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,919
i'm walking with this baby cap the cows

592
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,120
are coming up to me and they're not

593
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
having any of it the baby calf is

594
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,880
freaking out because it's wearing a dog

595
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,039
collar with flowers on it totally not

596
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,520
its style it's freaking out and my wife

597
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,360
and i turn around in the middle of this

598
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,440
hair storm and start running from this

599
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,120
herd of cows and we're running towards

600
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,960
the fence and i'm thinking i've got this

601
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,640
baby calf and i'm like i gotta get the

602
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,200
baby calf to safety so finally i just

603
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,840
like set the baby cap down eric and i

604
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,000
jump over the fence to safety and like

605
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,480
the whole herd of cows you're staring

606
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,240
right at the edge of the fence like come

607
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,159
over on this side

608
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,400
yeah

609
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,400
hill storm goes through my wife and i

610
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,679
are stopped we're freezing cold we've

611
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,280
got welts

612
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,159
from hail all over us and the baby calf

613
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,720
just like gets up goes to mama and just

614
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,159
starts chilling out for the rest of the

615
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,039
day

616
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,280
um

617
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,720
then

618
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,880
when my family members came and visited

619
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,640
us and they saw this calf with this dog

620
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,400
collar for like the next week they're

621
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,080
like why the hell does your calf have a

622
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,440
dog collar that's

623
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
that's really weird

624
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,799
so sure enough

625
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,880
that was embarrassing right for a long

626
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,799
time until we got him in the chute and

627
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,760
we got the

628
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,039
dog collar off so that was a good time

629
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,440
this particular baby calf this baby cap

630
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,320
has the name of boloff if you remember

631
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,760
in the movie um frozen um you had ella

632
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,240
and you had bull olaf which was the uh

633
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
which was the uh the

634
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,400
snowman that's running around you know

635
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,760
and

636
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,840
for whatever reason mom decided to drop

637
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,840
this baby cap at negative 20.

638
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,559
um by the time that we got to this calf

639
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,720
uh he was outside he was sitting in a

640
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,320
bunch of uh

641
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,720
sitting in a bunch of feed and uh we

642
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,960
picked him up and his his hair he was

643
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,679
just born so he's still wet so he was he

644
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,039
was crusty

645
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,760
um because he was frozen and um we moved

646
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,240
him into the shop now he was still very

647
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,799
very very new and mom hadn't gotten

648
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,000
protective

649
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,240
of him yet now that usually takes a

650
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
little while a few hours for the mom to

651
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,760
get protective otherwise they're like

652
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
dang that's one big ugly turd and they

653
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,159
just move on and then slowly it starts

654
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,520
to sink in this was a baby and i need to

655
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,159
take care of it and this was a new mom

656
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:36,880
so

657
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,039
we moved boloff into the shop and we've

658
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,440
turned on a whole bunch of diesel uh

659
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,159
torpedo heaters and mom was having none

660
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,720
of it mom didn't want to go in

661
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,080
and

662
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,679
once again that was a that was a hard

663
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,080
night because we had to corral mom into

664
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,200
the rough area where the calf was we had

665
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,679
to kind of shoo mom in so they were in

666
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,520
the same area mom didn't want to go into

667
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,840
the shop because it smelled strange and

668
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,640
we fought this constantly now this i

669
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,480
don't think did we end up trenching olaf

670
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,320
i don't think we did did we

671
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,520
trenching yep we had to trench him um so

672
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,080
whenever you trench a uh a bowl or a

673
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,400
baby calf you drive a tube down their

674
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,000
throat and you send milk replacement

675
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,400
because they uh they need food

676
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,960
especially whenever it's that cold um he

677
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
needed to eat very very very quickly and

678
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,480
get some nutrients otherwise he was just

679
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,240
going to freeze to death mind you this

680
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,159
is at night so it's like really late we

681
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,679
got these bullet heaters we're trenching

682
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,799
this cow

683
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,000
and

684
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,440
he made it

685
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,600
now if you see bullock today he had

686
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,440
these big beautiful ears when he was

687
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,840
born um you can kind of see it a little

688
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,520
bit on the right hand side you can see

689
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,799
where it's dark

690
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,320
he was getting frostbite he actually

691
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,400
lost about half his ears

692
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,720
um because he kind of froze before we

693
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,640
were able to get to him um but that's a

694
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
positive story you know we were able to

695
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,799
save the baby cow um and there's gonna

696
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,799
be people that are vegetarians like how

697
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,799
can you stand to eat an animal that you

698
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,240
did something like this with and i'm not

699
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,679
going to give you a clean answer i grew

700
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,840
up around ranching it's harder than hell

701
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,720
on me

702
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,640
anytime we process these cows because in

703
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,720
a lot of ways these cows become family

704
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,080
some of them just become ornery and they

705
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,520
start trying to kill me those ones are

706
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,480
easier but um this is yeah it's tough

707
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,600
i'm not going to lie i'm not going to

708
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
try to be like well because your taste

709
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,000
it's harder and harder as the time goes

710
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,520
on

711
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,279
um

712
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,120
goats and diarrhea

713
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,799
so this is oreo cookie ice cream i think

714
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,640
it was the name of this goat it was oreo

715
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,200
might have been just oreo i'm not sure

716
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,880
but land in my sun you can kind of see

717
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,200
in the background named these baby uh

718
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,120
goats that we got

719
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,320
um this particular baby goat um ended up

720
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,799
getting very very very sick

721
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,679
and

722
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,600
we

723
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,919
uh the night before we took him into the

724
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,440
vet uh we let him sleep inside and he

725
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,520
was not moving so

726
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,440
we put him in kind of a nest with a

727
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
whole bunch of straw inside of the house

728
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
where it was warm once again it was cold

729
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,559
well no no it was summertime when this

730
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,279
one happened and um

731
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,799
uh he decided once he got in the house

732
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,159
and he got warmed up he's like i'm gonna

733
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,520
start walking around

734
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,679
and he started walking around and was

735
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,080
still very very very ill so we took him

736
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,840
into the vet

737
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,120
and that gave him a uh gave him some

738
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,799
antibiotics

739
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,320
which we found out after the fact was

740
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,720
the wrong thing to do

741
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,360
mainly because what the antibiotic does

742
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,279
is it gives the goat like horrible

743
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,400
diarrhea

744
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,480
so this particular goat

745
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,240
we had him bundled up in the back of a

746
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,919
pickup truck in the back seat not the

747
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,520
backpack but the back seat of a pickup

748
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,039
truck in um in a big old blanket we took

749
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,320
him from the uh uh from the vet put him

750
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,400
in the back of the truck and he just

751
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,640
started just pooping everywhere and it

752
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,240
wasn't like a nice like solid poop

753
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,440
you're like golly gee i'll throw that

754
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,840
out the window no it was like runny

755
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,840
and it's in the truck and it smells bad

756
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,919
we're stopping at gas stations and we're

757
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,200
getting all of these different like

758
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,440
glass wipes trying to clean it up and

759
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,080
poops again it's just it's just it's

760
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,440
horrible right

761
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,559
and then

762
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,320
we ended up getting home

763
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,000
and um

764
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,080
uh my wife went shopping at walmart

765
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,440
she's like well i'm gonna go shopping at

766
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,279
walmart and get some groceries and stuff

767
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,799
so i had this goat

768
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,520

769
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,279

770
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,559

771
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,720

825
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,520
of the house

826
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,480
and

827
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,120
it's just it's absolutely miserable and

828
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,799
uh of course they're all outside they're

829
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,000
like hey can we come back in that was

830
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,880
fun

831
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,640
um

832
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,520
so

833
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,679
just like probably

834
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,440
probably one of the biggest messes i've

835
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,120
ever encountered in my life not the

836
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,039
biggest this was right up there this is

837
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,240
top five

838
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,159
for sure and after i get it all kind of

839
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,279
cleaned up

840
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,960
and i kept cleaning i kept cleaning i

841
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,159
kept cleaning

842
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,080
and uh my wife shows up with the

843
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,360
groceries

844
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,320
and uh like did i miss anything and i'm

845
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
like i can't get the smell of diarrhea

846
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,480
out of the house i tried i don't know

847
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,320
where it's at and she like comes in and

848
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,799
she's like smells she goes

849
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,320
i'm pretty sure that's you and i

850
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,760
realized at that point i was probably

851
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
covered in it so i had to shower and get

852
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,840
everything cleaned up um

853
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,640
so

854
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,240
fun story

855
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,159
it's actually not

856
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,600
uh the goat passed away that night

857
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,520
and that's not the only animal we've

858
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,080
lost i've lost uh i've lost a couple of

859
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,279
calves

860
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,760
i have lost multiple piglets

861
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,600
um

862
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,360
i've lost i've lost chickens i know

863
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,039
chicken's kind of a dumb animal there's

864
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,640
a couple of chickens that i i've gotten

865
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,240
close to my family's gotten close to

866
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,360
over the years

867
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,440
and um

868
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,120
you know whenever you you're around

869
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,480
farmers and ranchers they're like ah

870
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,600
it's just the way it is you just you

871
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
know kind of move on it still hurts

872
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,120
right you know like these animals become

873
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,000
part of the family and these cute little

874
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,679
baby goats were definitely part of the

875
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:50,720
family

876
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,880
and now we have two other goats that one

877
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,080
long lived and they're doing really

878
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,600
really really well but

879
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
it's hard

880
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,519
right it's very hard

881
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,120
and this picture is a hard one for me

882
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,519
too that's muffin and lily

883
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,960
um two of the best dogs we ever had um i

884
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,880
would say the best dogs that we've ever

885
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,760
had

886
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
we currently have a uh not a puppy he's

887
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,200
about a year and a half old his name's

888
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,200
tahoe and he's doing really really good

889
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,039
but even him

890
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,120
he's a cow dog and he got kicked by a

891
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
cow and we thought he was dead

892
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,320
um

893
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,880
lily got bone cancer when she was about

894
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,240
two or three

895
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,320
and uh we had to put her down

896
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,799
and muffin was an older dog and was up

897
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,440
underneath the vehicle and the vehicle

898
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,039
ran her over

899
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,120
and

900
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,200
the reason why i'm saying this is these

901
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,159
stories of fails are fun

902
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,600
you know anytime

903
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,440
someone can share that type of visceral

904
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,080
experience of failure and what happens

905
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,440
these are kind of fun stories but

906
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,760
they kind of cut

907
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,039
and

908
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,720
you know every time somebody talks about

909
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,200
a manager that was a horrible manager

910
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,120
you know we joke about it now but but it

911
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,200
hurts at the time when you have these

912
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,240
amazing dogs on on the farm and

913
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,919
you know you lose them both within like

914
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,880
48 hours of each other or you have bulls

915
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,559
that you try to

916
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,159
nurse back to health and they end up

917
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,240
crawling underneath a bale feeder and

918
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,480
freezing to death or

919
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,039
like i said piglets that are born and

920
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,120
for whatever reason they didn't they

921
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
were born on one side of the pig pen far

922
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,519
away from the straw and they ended up

923
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,679
dying because mom didn't move them over

924
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,519
or didn't have them she was a new mother

925
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,440
so you deal with us all the time and

926
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,880
you're constantly dealing with these

927
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,840
setbacks like constantly it's just it's

928
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,360
unending

929
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,559
and there's things i didn't even talk

930
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,720
about like i didn't talk about a utv

931
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,159
accident that almost killed my son i

932
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,679
didn't talk about slipping off the top

933
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,760
of a skid steer while putting up a roof

934
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,600
and cracking some ribs multiple

935
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,919
different trips to the er for stitches

936
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,640
cows on the run like drones are awesome

937
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,559
for cows that disappear but trying to

938
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,960
corral cows and my wife running into a

939
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,640
hornet's nest trying to get the cows

940
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,880
back um this is a picture of a forest

941
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,559
fire that happened a year ago in

942
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,720
december

943
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,120
that we were out all night digging up

944
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,960
trenches to stop the fire clearing out

945
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,799
undergrowth because we thought for sure

946
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,960
our entire place was going to be hit as

947
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,039
soon as that fire got into the lower

948
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,960
part where the wind was coming up at 55

949
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,360
60 miles an hour it was gonna like take

950
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,000
us out uh chicken coops burning down in

951
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,080
the middle of winter tons of gardening

952
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,279
fails um i always joke if you open up a

953
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,960
book and it says gardening in the black

954
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,000
hills it's just one word don't um

955
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,519
but you know there's tons of fails

956
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,440
associated with that castrating pigs not

957
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,279
even going to talk about that

958
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,120
tons of equipment failures and working

959
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,880
on equipment and frozen fuel lines water

960
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,120
in the fuel lines and just trying to

961
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,799
deal with all of that more sad dog

962
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,720
stories some are too raw i can't even

963
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,880
talk about construction fails trying to

964
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,559
build something and working with

965
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,080
construction companies and it takes two

966
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,200
three years

967
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,039
and

968
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,080
this is

969
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,960
this is

970
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,679
for me i have we have a small farm

971
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,519
and for me growing up around ranching

972
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,600
communities this was normal

973
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,599
this is just the way it was

974
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,839
you always were dealing with things like

975
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,079
this like a herd of cows going out on

976
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,399
the water in a feed

977
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,800
and a stock dam and they all break

978
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
through the ice and they all freeze to

979
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,040
death and die

980
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,800
you know this is this is what it's like

981
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,159
and there's questions and they're valid

982
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,079
questions about why the hell

983
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,399
do you do this

984
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,280
honestly i can't imagine living my life

985
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,520
any other way

986
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,839
you know it it's tough right you're

987
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,639
constantly fighting these things

988
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,918
and i think

989
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,879
a lot of these farm fails can apply to

990
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,399
computer security

991
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,520
and it's not that much of a stretch

992
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,760
i had a student last week in my answer

993
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,520
to security class

994
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,960
and

995
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,560
i've never been so worried about a

996
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,280
person in my life

997
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,440
he was constantly talking about

998
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,440
self-harm

999
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,680
he constantly needed help which was fine

1000
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,359
and constantly put himself down as

1001
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,160
though it was his hobby to tear himself

1002
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,480
down

1003
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,760
eventually he just stopped responding

1004
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,800
i hope he's okay

1005
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
but i feel for him

1006
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,200
and over the years teaching and working

1007
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,079
with lots and lots of people

1008
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:30,960
you

1009
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,160
end up

1010
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,480
running across these people

1011
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,240
and you may be one of those people as

1012
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,359
well

1013
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,440
you may have to deal with that

1014
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,200
so i want to give you some concepts if

1015
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
you're new to security even if you're

1016
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,200
not new to security i see people on

1017
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,520
twitter that are hurting i see people on

1018
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,200
twitter that are bleak

1019
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,800
and they

1020
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,880
put themselves down

1021
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,400
the first thing i want you to understand

1022
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,359
is failure is part of the system

1023
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,200
you see infosec thought leaders or

1024
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,960
infosec rockstars you see these people

1025
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
up on talks and they do all of these

1026
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,720
amazing things

1027
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,760
and

1028
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,200
if you really sit down and talk with

1029
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
them and have a dinner or a beer or root

1030
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,480
beer with them

1031
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
there's a ton of failure

1032
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,079
that goes into that

1033
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,400
to that one presentation that you saw

1034
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,240
that just blew your socks off there's a

1035
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,000
tremendous amount of failure that goes

1036
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,320
into that point

1037
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,920
we don't talk about it

1038
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,839
and we

1039
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,040
should we really need to be talking

1040
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,960
about what our failures are and how we

1041
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,400
can do better

1042
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,160
i want you also to focus on the good

1043
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,200
things

1044
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,720
i think especially in these days and

1045
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,280
ages it's really easy to get so caught

1046
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,599
up in all the negativity i don't want to

1047
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,440
say that things aren't bad because

1048
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,920
there's things that suck right

1049
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,280
i don't want to say that things aren't

1050
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,119
going to be that they could be a whole

1051
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,440
lot worse but what i am going to say is

1052
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,320
that there are good things

1053
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,640
there are great people

1054
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,960
leslie and this entire con is one of

1055
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,880
those shining examples

1056
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,520
i ask you to focus on the good things

1057
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,760
focus on the positive people

1058
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,920
you need to let the bad things go

1059
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,720
don't let the bad things define you

1060
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,320
it's not a good way to define yourself

1061
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,400
and i see this all the time

1062
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,000
you know we have multiple deaths we have

1063
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,160
multiple er visits are you dealing with

1064
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,760
trolls online

1065
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,599
don't let them define you and i suck at

1066
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,520
this too when somebody comes at me i

1067
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,520
want to prove them wrong on the internet

1068
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,280
i want to beat them up on twitter and

1069
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,359
embarrass them for all to see

1070
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,200
stop

1071
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,599
we need to stop feeding the trolls

1072
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,320
and

1073
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,000
i get caught up in it too where someone

1074
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,560
says something really horrible

1075
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,280
um maybe racist misogynistic or horrible

1076
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,000
and everybody has to pile on to get that

1077
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,760
one dig in on this person

1078
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,599
how about we let it go and we all

1079
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,280
unilaterally block those people

1080
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,040
because they don't get that and be like

1081
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,520
well golly gee i learned my lesson

1082
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,720
some of them enjoy it

1083
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,040
that's what they like

1084
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,520
all bosses

1085
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,960
you're in a great industry find another

1086
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,800
job if you can right

1087
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,280
other things people say things you think

1088
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,960
people say

1089
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,760
let it go and i know this is hard right

1090
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
this is not i don't want to be flippant

1091
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,200
and say that this is easy because this

1092
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,760
crap eats me at night too but you have

1093
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
to let the bag go

1094
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,160
like i mentioned in the farm fails

1095
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,839
sometimes whenever you're dealing with

1096
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,480
this stuff it can overwhelm you

1097
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,560
and you can't you've got to focus on the

1098
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,119
positive you've got to keep going you've

1099
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,599
got to keep trying

1100
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,599
and you see this like farming in social

1101
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,520
media in the in the movies i i think

1102
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,599
it's funny whenever you see people start

1103
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,680
a farm in the movies it's just like all

1104
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,359
of a sudden they change into jean

1105
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,720
jackets and the next thing you know

1106
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,880
they're producing tomatoes the size of

1107
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,680
your head pumpkins the size of a small

1108
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,920
car they've got cornrows that are

1109
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,480
amazing and it looks like it's super

1110
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,640
easy and then you're trying to do this

1111
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,599
and you're failing at everything and

1112
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,280
everything is dying around you

1113
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,680
don't trust the movies

1114
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,760
social media if people say oh you know i

1115
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,599
hate i'm trying to start a farm and if

1116
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,440
i'm on facebook i have all these people

1117
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,280
that are showing their amazing bounty

1118
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,040
and all these amazing things that they

1119
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,079
did and i suck it's funny social media

1120
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,599
is no different the farming community

1121
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,839
that is in the security community can't

1122
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,000
trust these things

1123
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,800
i really want to ask you know make being

1124
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,000
positive

1125
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,640
the focus of what you do and i know that

1126
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,160
this is hard

1127
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,200
i know that this is difficult

1128
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,119
but sometimes no matter how hard it is

1129
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,560
maybe you have to fake it you have to

1130
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,640
pretend to be positive

1131
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,079
if that's what it takes that's what it

1132
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,599
takes

1133
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,680
and whether we're talking about farm

1134
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,359
fails or we're talking about information

1135
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,440
security fails

1136
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,040
i would also ask that we're a little bit

1137
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,720
kinder to each other whenever we screw

1138
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,440
up

1139
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,520
if you have a co-worker who brings down

1140
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,280
an entire network segment because of a

1141
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,839
bonehead move with a scan

1142
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,680
be understanding

1143
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,119
be helpful

1144
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,560
be a mentor

1145
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,640
share your experience where you've done

1146
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
something like that and then learn from

1147
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,640
the mistakes together

1148
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,319
because we suck at that in this industry

1149
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,359
guys

1150
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,920
it is constant that there's a mistake

1151
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,760
and we immediately oh well asak the

1152
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,920
intern was a big idiot

1153
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,760
i've done it

1154
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,839
i did it for years

1155
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,599
i'm old enough now where i can look back

1156
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,520
and say that was probably not the right

1157
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
way to do things

1158
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,599
so let's try to be positive let's try to

1159
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,119
help each other let's try to build each

1160
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,560
other up

1161
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,119
kind of my last thing here i want to

1162
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,200
drive home to

1163
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,040
is this industry is finally getting to

1164
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,680
the point where i think it's a very good

1165
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,599
industry where we're exhibiting a lot of

1166
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,920
virtues of building each other's up

1167
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,240
supporting each other yeah there's a

1168
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,319
there's right they're always

1169
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,720
going to be a-holes like you can't look

1170
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,240
at and say well we aren't in a good

1171
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,839
place because this person said something

1172
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,520
that i just stopped

1173
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,000
it's much better than it was

1174
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,760
it used to be we constantly ripped on

1175
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,280
each other we always constantly called

1176
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,200
each other noobs we constantly try to

1177
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,760
find ways to build ourselves up so that

1178
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,079
we looked better so we didn't look weak

1179
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,319
to other people

1180
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,839
and i would ask

1181
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,319
we need to keep it up and it's not some

1182
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,480
haphazard mistake there's been a number

1183
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,160
of us in this industry that have worked

1184
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,520
very very hard to focus on the positive

1185
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,839
to build people up to constantly give

1186
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,760
back to the community but it's only

1187
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,200
sustainable if we all work together

1188
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,359
so please keep working together

1189
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,359

looking forward to listening to it for

1203
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
the rest of the day leslie thank you so

1204
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,920
much for being here we have a couple

1205
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,079
questions since i've got like a minute

1206
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,400
i've got like two questions at the top

1207
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,200
all right so the first one is uh legal

1208
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,599
legal concerns with cyber deception do

1209
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,079
you talk to your lawyers etc no you

1210
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,480
don't need to um and let me explain why

1211
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,640
um i shouldn't say that lawyers hate it

1212
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,839
when i say that lawyers like you should

1213
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,079
talk to us all the time for everything

1214
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,760
um whenever you're doing cyber deception

1215
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,119
in the form of accounts and you're

1216
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,800
dealing with documents that are on your

1217
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,960
systems they are yours as long as you

1218
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,200
aren't getting persistent uh like access

1219
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,040
to an attacker's computer system you're

1220
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,800
more than likely going to be okay and

1221
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,200
the main case for that is case the judge

1222
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,280
walter rice ruled um it is one thing to

1223
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,960
track a stolen computer system down to

1224
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,480
get its ip address or geographic

1225
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,319
location it is something entirely

1226
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,800
different to violate federal wiretapping

1227
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,359
laws to do so so simply getting ip

1228
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,000
address or location information probably

1229
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,040
okay

1230
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,720
don't get access to their files don't

1231
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,640
start going through their web history

1232
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,000
kind of set that up as a line you're

1233
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,640
more than likely going to be okay

1234
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,280
okay super well we're about out of time

1235
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,720
and i need to switch over to the next

1236
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,240
talk i apologize but there are a few

1237
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,000
more questions for you in the slack and

1238
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
