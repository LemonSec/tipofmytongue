1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
we have how to get into get involved in

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,080
the security community and preserving

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,480
the past for the future with dr meg

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,360
layton hi how are you i'm good good to

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,200
see you angela how are you

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,120
doing great

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,759
looking forward to your talk

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,840
well i'm a little anxious to close it

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,119
out but i figure after the last uh talk

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,080
on the on on the cameras and taking the

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,160
photographs preserving them is a nice

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,880
transition absolutely

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,800
um i'm going to share my screen

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,399
and you're going to tell me it looks

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,719
good

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,160
it does look good

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,000
awesome

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,680
okay

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,120
um just so you know angela when i switch

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,960
to the second part of the talk i will no

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
longer be able to see the screen because

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,719
i actually will turn around at that

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,120
point so okay if something happens just

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,559
give me a

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,719
verbal cue that i have to address

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,399
something on my end we'll do

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,160
okay thank you you're welcome

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,799
okay so um

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,400
there's a 1675 letter by isaac newton

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,200
that says if i have seen further is by

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,280
standing on the shoulders of giants and

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,080
a large part of this sentiment

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,400
is having other folks lift you up to

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
take you further and the infosec

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,880
community is a great way to do this

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,720
making sure you preserve your learnings

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,119
is a great way to lift up others into

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,479
the futures

39
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,640
getting involved in the community is a

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,840
popular response when new people ask how

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,720
can i learn more about security a lot of

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,880
people answer you should get involved in

43
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,479
the community

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,600
but that response seldom answers the how

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,360
for people who are just breaking into

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,759
the field it's almost like you need the

47
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,680
secret decoder ring to be able to break

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,240
into the secret decoder community

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,000
the wonderful thing about the field is

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,759
that it's constantly changing which

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,520
means everybody has something to

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,079
contribute

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,520
so here's a little bit about what you

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,919
need to know about me i've been around

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,800
20 years in security 30 years in tech

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,280
i'm an adjunct professor for classes in

57
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,680
cyber security that include risk network

58
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,319
forensics introduction to cyber security

59
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,239
and i've been a cyber patriot mentoring

60
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,879
coach for the last several years i have

61
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,120
a whole slew of certifications after my

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
name but the more important information

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,120
is that i am a mom

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,239
a teacher a traveler a buffy fan a

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,239
passionate lifelong learner and i

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,200
occasionally break into 80s songs

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,800
so that's what you need to know about me

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
um i did a lot of research on the

69
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,200
definition of community and so i put

70
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,040
together this little word cloud of kind

71
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,440
of what came up when i when i said okay

72
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,000
what makes a community and i discovered

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,160
that in general the formal definitions

74
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,400
talked a lot about common attitudes and

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,560
common interests and goals and they

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,959
talked a lot about sharing

77
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,519
when i talk to my children or my classes

78
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,440
about community i think these are

79
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,239
missing a fundamental part of what makes

80
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,800
a community you need both the give and

81
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,280
the take what i mean by this is that you

82
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,239
can be working towards a common goal and

83
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,319
still not feel like you are part of a

84
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,800
community perhaps you are working

85
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,480
towards a common goal as part of your

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,040
job you have been tasked as part of a

87
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,200
pta committee

88
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,280
that's a little different than an actual

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,519
community a community

90
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,840
requires individuals to interact in

91
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,319
their commonality to give as well as to

92
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,959
receive without that the community sort

93
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,040
of dies off

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,519
in jane franklin's wonderful book in

95
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,560
security she talks about a posse a small

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
group of people that you can count on

97
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,040
when the going gets tough and i would

98
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,319
argue that if you have a posse

99
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,400
they likely will provide you insights

100
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,519
into your community she then talks goes

101
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,760
on to talk about weak ties and building

102
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,480
a wider community connection so that you

103
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,879
can access different types of thinking

104
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,799
and sort out different types of

105
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,000
challenges

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,400
that concept is based on sociologist

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,560
mark granavetter who talks about how to

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
ensure you build connections which are

109
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,639
loose and diverse and when you're

110
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,520
building out your community you really

111
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
want to make sure that your connections

112
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,880
are loose and diverse

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,639
so when you're looking around and trying

114
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,199
to evaluate your community the best

115
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,040
place to start

116
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,680
is just look around you infosec is a

117
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,080
giant ocean of people

118
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,479
of interests it's not so much a

119
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,960
community as an ecosystem when you say

120
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,040
the infosec community

121
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,520
so you want to narrow it down you want

122
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,680
to narrow it down to what have you found

123
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,960
useful

124
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,639
what makes you feel like you belong

125
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,400
what interest do you have in common

126
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,720
do you wish what you wish you knew more

127
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,919
about

128
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,080
what do you enjoy most and it's

129
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
important to note here that everybody's

130
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,560
community doesn't look the same

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
people have different goals they have

132
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,919
different interests and they have

133
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,320
different lived experiences

134
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,080
you want to ensure that you have enough

135
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,320
diversity so that your community has a

136
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,280
path to expand your views

137
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,360
i use this graphic down in the corner

138
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,240
because a long time ago when my children

139
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,639
were just born i had this wonderful kind

140
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,880
of chat room with where we called

141
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,600
ourselves the geek moms and then i found

142
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,840
a sort of corner of the chat room that

143
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,000
were infosec people and then i found a

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,720
kind of corner of that room where we

145
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,880
were people who would do ctfs really

146
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,400
late at night because that's when we

147
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,479
were up with our children and so we

148
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,039
would only do them that late at night

149
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,960
and we would always make a team together

150
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,799
and it was just kind of fun that way

151
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,919
so this is my danger will robinson slide

152
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,759
lots of people take the idea that they

153
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,360
want to be a contributor to the

154
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,199
community and think of it as another

155
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,440
chore something to do in addition to

156
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,600
what you are already doing

157
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,440
please don't take this to be the point

158
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,479
of the talk

159
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,639
at no point am i saying that what you

160
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,639
are doing right now in the middle of a

161
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,880
pandemic in light of new and interesting

162
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,840
challenges and commuting patterns with

163
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,160
new and strange sleep patterns i am in

164
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,080
no way saying that what you are doing

165
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,919
right now isn't enough

166
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,840
if your goal of the moment is to come

167
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,759
out the other side of the pandemic

168
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,840
without having lost your mind that is a

169
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,280
wonderful goal

170
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
more power to you heck if your goal

171
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,440
today is to get everyone fed and then

172
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,039
everyone in the house into a pair of

173
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,039
pants that's a great goal go ahead and

174
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,360
do that i applaud that

175
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,599
if your goal is to have learned to code

176
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,840
one thing that's awesome

177
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,039
don't be left feeling this way

178
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,440
at no point should somebody come up to

179
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,680
you and ask you these questions and make

180
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,400
you feel like spongebob here

181
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
if these are your goals

182
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,080
that's awesome

183
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,360
if your goal and public tools and

184
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,080
writing things and talking gives you

185
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,319
high levels of anxiety then these are

186
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,199
not your goals and that's okay

187
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,280
recognize these questions for what they

188
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,520
are random gatekeeping which says more

189
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
about the person asking the question

190
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,280
than it says about you

191
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,120
it's likely them saying look at this

192
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,360
thing i did and praise me because i am

193
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,960
cool

194
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
which you can find out by just asking

195
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
the same question back

196
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,880
the most important thing when you get

197
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,960
involved in something is to be honest

198
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,199
with yourself about what you have and

199
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,400
what you want especially right now so

200
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,680
i'm going to

201
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,599
tell you what my friend steve says which

202
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,919
is hey don't hate people because they

203
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,479
don't have cves you're being a jerk

204
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,160
um and he said we could cite it as

205
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,919
needed so here you go steve here's your

206
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,360
site

207
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,800
um

208
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,199
so noted

209
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,680
uh so now here's where you're really at

210
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,879
the cox what what can you contribute if

211
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,400
you're new

212
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,639
think about what you can share how often

213
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,520
do you share oftentimes people who are

214
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,560
new

215
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,479
think they don't have enough of

216
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,360
something to contribute you're enough

217
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,080
and so this is where i often tell people

218
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,240
you're enough and what you have is

219
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,479
different than what i already know

220
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,120
one perspective to me today of how i

221
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,440
broke into infosec from somebody who's

222
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,159
just on that part of the journey is

223
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,039
super useful to me i broke in 20 years

224
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,360
ago i guarantee you your journey is

225
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,679
different than mine

226
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,599
everyone is looking for what someone

227
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,959
else knows

228
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,880
last year i said something

229
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,560
in twitter about

230
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,720
how if you are presented with data

231
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,560
before you do anything it is good to

232
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,880
trust but verify

233
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,080
to which somebody had answered

234
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,480
times my data was wrong and how stupid i

235
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,120
looked afterwards might be my new

236
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,440
talk topic i would totally go to that

237
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
talk that is a talk i would go to

238
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,519
because i don't think we talk enough

239
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,279
about some of the mistakes we've all

240
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,320
made

241
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,160
so when you're thinking about this

242
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,480
remember that not everyone can share the

243
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,600
same way

244
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,880
so if

245
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,680
a way you can contribute is blogs or

246
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,160
talks or coaching or mentoring those are

247
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,959
great ways but also think about how you

248
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,240
can support

249
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,320
what you can support and how do you

250
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,080
support if you have a favorite

251
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,560
conference or cause a lot of the

252
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,279
conferences especially the smaller ones

253
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,519
are run by volunteers

254
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,440
being a good audience being a good

255
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,800
cheerleader

256
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,040
a good supporter is so important of

257
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,480
course there's a possibility of

258
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,440
supporting with money but also retweet

259
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,200
amplify voices

260
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,839
do a paper review so many of us need

261
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,399
extra eyes on those papers

262
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,680
planning implementation all that sort of

263
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,200
thing

264
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,120
is so important

265
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,399
think about what you can contribute

266
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,200
how can you contribute and again

267
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,560
you want to repeat with other

268
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,120
communities as i said before

269
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,600
everybody's community doesn't look the

270
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,440
same and you're not the member of only

271
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,680
one community you have many many

272
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,560
communities so it's not a one and done

273
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,120
but more of an exploration of yourself

274
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,920
of what you need of what you know

275
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,160
and of what others have to offer so

276
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,000
don't stop at the first thing that

277
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,959
emerges and recognize that your needs

278
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,360
and the needs of others actually change

279
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,839
over time and that's okay

280
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,160
you can get involved with the community

281
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,800
today and then you can gracefully bow

282
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
out and move on to something when your

283
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,479
needs change that's okay

284
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,720
um so here's a couple examples of kind

285
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,040
of what it looks like in my life and

286
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,959
what that might look like in your life

287
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,800
is going to be completely difference and

288
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,079
that's okay

289
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,600
a long time ago

290
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,360
in a lamb far away i am a sans fan as

291
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,160
you could probably tell from the the

292
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,240
plethora of letters after my name and

293
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,920
i've been a learner there for a long

294
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,640
time actually the first thing that i

295
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,560
ever was published in

296
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,480
a long time ago was called a community

297
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,760
consensus project put out by by sans

298
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,839
so i've been to a lot of sans

299
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,279
conferences as a learner booth marketer

300
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,640
um and a lot of vendor conferences and

301
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,959
i've been a sans mentor for for a course

302
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,040
or two and so that means that i have a

303
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
personal connection to several sans

304
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,480
educators

305
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,399
and um

306
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,920
one of them called me at one point was

307
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,519
like hey you really need to get on this

308
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,839
webcast you you want to listen to what

309
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,480
um this woman is is gonna say when she

310
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,360
gets on her name is tara and so tara

311
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,720
wrote her book

312
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,279
and um she if you don't know tara she

313
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,639
wrote woman in tech and

314
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,120
through sans i kind of connected with

315
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,399
with tara and since that time

316
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,560
we've kind of built this friendship a

317
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,880
cohort she's been a co-worker we have

318
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,959
this kind of mutual support system and

319
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,560
if you look real carefully you'll even

320
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,760
find my name in her book somewhere

321
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,560
but that was part of me

322
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,040
i was doing my best to amplify the voice

323
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,880
because women in tech is such an

324
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,320
important cause to me so i got on and i

325
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,480
i did my best to amplify the voice and

326
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,320
that was a contribution i could make to

327
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,639
that community at the time

328
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,800
similarly

329
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,360
i am a scouting parent both girl scouts

330
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,200
and scouts bsa

331
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
and um

332
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,839
so i was in a scout troop

333
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,880
and

334
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,279
the parents were talking about their

335
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,279
children who were going to the new high

336
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,200
school the following year

337
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,040
and they were talking about the high

338
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,800
school was brand new so it didn't have

339
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,120
any clubs yet and

340
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
they were trying to figure out

341
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,279
hey what kind of clubs would these

342
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,320
rising freshmen be interested in doing

343
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,800
and they talked about has anybody heard

344
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,480
about this thing called cyberpatriot

345
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,959
some of the scouts were interested

346
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,639
some of the parents were interested a

347
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,959
bunch of us worked in cybersecurity and

348
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,120
that's how we all became kind of colgan

349
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,160
cyber patriot coaches and mentors and

350
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,560
made that happen but the community

351
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,680
itself actually started out at at the

352
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,120
scout meetings

353
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,959
um and i'm not sure that that journey

354
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,839
would have been the same had we come up

355
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,200
kind of not connected in scouts first so

356
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,360
it's really important to recognize that

357
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,560
your journey into the community can

358
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,480
be as important as finding that

359
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,320
community that you fit into

360
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,440
your path forward kind of whoops

361
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,040
looks like this

362
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,240
you want to think about your

363
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,120
opportunities and your assets

364
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,279
you want to think about what you enjoy

365
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,880
you want to think about who is in your

366
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,199
posse that you can depend on and who is

367
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,720
in your network and what are your

368
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,120
current resources

369
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,399
and remember that that's two two ways

370
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,760
what do you need and what do you have

371
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,680
and when you i think talk about

372
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,560
resources i don't just mean like what's

373
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,279
in your brain but i also mean think very

374
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,760
carefully about your time do you have a

375
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,839
day a year you could maybe dedicate to

376
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,240
this an hour a month

377
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,160
do you love to review papers in the

378
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,240
evening with a glass of wine and would

379
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,720
you be willing to give your feedback

380
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,160
do you have an account where you can

381
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,760
boost others

382
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,480
share the mike and cyber might might be

383
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
loving to talk to you

384
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,560
do you love to talk do you hate to talk

385
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,279
but you love to read do you hate to read

386
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,839
and talk but you love to write

387
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,920
what if all you can do is applaud and

388
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,720
smile like park yourself in the front

389
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,120
front seat of a conference and do that

390
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,279
what if all you can do is bake or you

391
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,800
think that's what you can give right now

392
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,720
you know what the next time a log for

393
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,160
jay comes around go ahead and bake

394
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,079
banana bread for your sock trust me

395
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,480
that's a that's a contribution to the

396
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,160
community right there

397
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
if your best time to contribute is

398
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,079
between 2 and 4 am

399
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,320
i've captured the flag moms that'll be

400
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,639
happy to talk to you

401
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,120
if you don't like to attend conferences

402
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,800
don't think that's the only way you can

403
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,040
do it and a lot of the conferences have

404
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,920
volunteer roles that you can slide into

405
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,600
without ever having

406
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
attended the conference at all

407
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,360
if you have a social media account

408
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,440
there's all sorts of things that you can

409
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,320
do

410
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,120
think about cross-promotion think about

411
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,040
education

412
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,360
if you remember nothing else from today

413
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,440
remember this

414
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,079
signal boosts and encouragement in this

415
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,360
day and age

416
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,000
cannot be underestimated it is very

417
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,399
little effort to be kind and encouraging

418
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,959
and that fuels people to continue their

419
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,000
journey and continue forward

420
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,959
everyone has weak ties and everyone has

421
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,440
that ability to strengthen you but you

422
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,600
need to start the journey to strengthen

423
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,079
your network and make sure that you've

424
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,399
got that connection into the different

425
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,639
communities you're already probably a

426
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,120
part of

427
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,680
so you want to start this journey by

428
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,759
kind of remembering the basics everyone

429
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,000
has something to offer and everyone has

430
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,800
something to need and this they need and

431
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,360
this is a marathon and not a sprint

432
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,199
and remember again that your needs and

433
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,720
abilities change over time the important

434
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,399
thing is that

435
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,560
you know your value and you pick your

436
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,680
reasons

437
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
and that's why we love peggy carter

438
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,199
because she knows her values and

439
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,199
everyone else's opinion doesn't really

440
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,839
matter i had somebody ask me once um

441
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,839
why did i think that

442
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,000
cyber patriot was a good fit for me and

443
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,320
the answer really was simple i wanted to

444
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,639
spend more times with my kids

445
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,920
my kids are perfectly happy to do cyber

446
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,760
challenges and that meant that if i

447
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,240
could make time to be a tech mentor i

448
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,640
could spend more time with my kids

449
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,959
serving as a tech mentor for their for

450
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,359
their teams so there are opportunities

451
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,880
for real life

452
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,760
and tech life to overlap and you want to

453
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,079
take advantage of those as you're

454
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,000
defining your community and thinking

455
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,119
about your resources

456
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,679

your corporate policies and make sure

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,799
you're allowed to talk about

465
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,640
what you're going to talk about if

you're social media bound

467
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,840
be sure to review your corporate

468
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,120
policies um your organization doesn't

469
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,280
always publish what they what they

470
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
expect of you and if you're not sure

471
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,360
make sure to check with somebody because

472
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,039
you don't want to be the person who

473
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,880
commits to doing something that you

474
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,480
can't actually do because you've

475
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,000
discovered that it's

476
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,679
a violation of your policies

477
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,880
i have a couple places to start pancakes

478
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,039
con most of us all of us here are

479
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,679
volunteers cyberpatriot is always

480
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,919
looking for volunteers

481
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,160
share the mic in cyber is a really great

482
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,880
way to amplify those voices and make

483
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,480
sure that you have

484
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,200
a way to lift other people up

485
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,360
and if you're looking for a conference

486
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,120
in your area i'm going to tell you to

487
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,640
reach out and find out where your

488
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,120
b-sides conference is

489
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,520
they will also happily look for places

490
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,880
like that there's also a couple

491
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,120
non-traditional places i'm a big fan of

492
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,880
the hacker book club

493
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,240
um

494
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,400
project cs girls i'm a big fan of the

495
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
sisters mailing list i actually

496
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
reconnected with somebody i knew from

497
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,840
high school because i was in the sisters

498
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
mailing list which made to some very

499
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,520
very great

500
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,919
opportunities to kind of reconnect and

501
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,240
strengthen those weak ties

502
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,520
so when you're thinking about

503
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,760
strengthening your weak ties

504
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,200
you want to find the twitter of your

505
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,039
linkedin and find the linkedin of your

506
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,120
twitter or whatever social media you're

507
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,640
on find out who they follow who have

508
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,240
common interests

509
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,360
to you and that gives you an opportunity

510
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,720
to make your links stronger

511
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,960
find a common place to

512
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
survey what

513
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,039
interests people have to learn to

514
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,799
collaborate

515
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,440
and look beyond the obvious look to your

516
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,280
slack channels your

517
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,840
discords your mailing lists and if you

518
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,600
have a favorite once you pop it in this

519
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,400
flag so other people can maybe join you

520
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,720
there to lurk and collaborate i'm sure

521
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,440
people will always be willing to chat

522
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,280
with each other and there's nothing

523
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,640
wrong with saying hey i um

524
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,039
chatted with you on the slack at

525
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,840
pancakes con um

526
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,919
and i'm interested in dungeons and

527
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,240
dragons and saw you had some comments on

528
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,480
that whatever it is that connects you to

529
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,679
that person

530
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,760
always contributing to your community

531
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,159
you want to sort of start with

532
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,400
what do we have in common and that makes

533
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,720
it much easier to make that journey

534
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,120
all right so that's kind of my my

535
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,799
remembering that you need to know who

536
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,840
you know what you know and how you learn

537
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,320
that will absolutely fuel and inform

538
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,880
your journey as you travel through if i

539
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,919
did this

540
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,480
right i'm about 20 minutes in

541
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,039
i'm happy to take questions and comments

542
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,200
at the end and i'll be in the slack

543
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,960
discussion but i do want to move on to

544
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,200
the second part of this

545
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,840
which is something completely different

546
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,440
um

547
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,480
which is about scrapbooking so we've all

548
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,960
heard the saying that once it's on the

549
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,120
internet it's there forever

550
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,360
but computers and the internet don't

551
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,880
always apply the best context

552
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,039
properly preserving and archiving your

553
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,440
pictures for the future gives everyone

554
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,600
something to look at even when the power

555
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,520
goes out or you're in the middle of a

556
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,720
pandemic

557
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,919
or

558
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,600
the cloud goes down

559
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,440
and it can help connect you to folks

560
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
when you don't get a chance to see them

561
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,679
in perhaps two years or a very long

562
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,960
while

563
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,120
scrapbooking teaches us with minimal

564
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,760
tools and just a little perseverance you

565
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,400
can capture memories in tangible ways

566
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,919
for the future

567
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,679
a lot of people say hey why do i get to

568
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,080
talk to you about scrapbooking and a

569
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,880
long time ago i actually worked

570
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,440
when i was a kid preserving

571
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
memories of some of the senior citizens

572
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,799
in our town

573
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,799
through living history programs we would

574
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,960
record them we would sort through their

575
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,919
memorabilia and we would try to preserve

576
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,400
those for the future one of my very

577
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,799
first jobs was this is photomat pho

578
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,320
photo me i don't know if anybody

579
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,919
remembers those little

580
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,320
kiosks but i used to work in one and i

581
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,400
worked my way through the school in my

582
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,039
work study at the library

583
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,640
my husband when i met him was a

584
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
professional photographer and about 20

585
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,559
years ago i was a creative memories

586
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,799
consultant which creative memories used

587
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,200
to be this big scrapbooking company i

588
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
don't actually know if they're still

589
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,799
doing but archiving and preserving

590
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,120
memories and stories is just a thing

591
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,440
that has always been important and so

592
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,520
when we talk about scrapbooking when i

593
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,919
talk about scrapbooking we are talking

594
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,159
about preserving a story for the future

595
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,400
many rainy days when my kids were young

596
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,080
we would sit around and look at our

597
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,440
books of photos for children that's way

598
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,280
more engaging than

599
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,640
scrolling through a screen is they they

600
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,039
connect to the paper they touch it and

601
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,360
they have some of this texture and this

602
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,640
context

603
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,360
um that child says it's there and then

604
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,159
it's gone if it's on the computer but

605
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,159
you really want to think about how do

606
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,799
you make the pictures and those memories

607
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,799
tangible so that it lasts

608
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,520
it's so important so as i switch to this

609
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,919
next part and i'm going to stop sharing

610
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,919
so that i can show you kind of what i'm

611
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,080
working on i wanted to give you a little

612
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,960
bit of this is all about preserving the

613
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,000
story

614
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,240
one of the tricky things in particular

615
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,240
is that if you try to do this much

616
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,559
farther down the line

617
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,880
time can add to the concept of that

618
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,559
unreliable narrator you don't

619
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,640
necessarily remember everything about

620
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,480
the photos on your phone

621
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,640
um so i'm going to show you a little bit

622
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,840
to kind of

623
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,960
talk through

624
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,880
the steps you're going to follow which

625
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,440
is to select mount journal and enhance

626
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,600
i'll show you the tools i'm using

627
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,360
but then i'll also talk a little bit

628
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,080
about projects that where you or

629
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,559
somebody else has probably already done

630
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,960
the the work and that should make it

631
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,600
easier for you to just get started and

632
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,440
put a couple things

633
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,880
um

634
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
down to preserve for the future the

635
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,080
reality is we're in unprecedented times

636
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,840
so preserving right now

637
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,760
um hey how did you feel about the

638
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,840
pandemic or what do you remember about

639
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,640
it will save you loads of trouble later

640
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,400
because one one of the things that um

641
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,279
i

642
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,000
was always sad about i don't know can i

643
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,480
even see i can't see my screen

644
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,559
one of the things i was always sad about

645
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,120
was that

646
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,799
i couldn't

647
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,720
ever tell

648
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,360
i didn't save as much as i should have

649
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,440
um

650
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,080
from 9 11. so when my kids came to me

651
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,080
and said

652
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,360
hey mom what do you remember about 9 11

653
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,679
i didn't have so many

654
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,600
physical things to give them so

655
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
hopefully you all can see me somebody

656
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,840
give me a heads up can you still see me

657
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,200
if i move over here it looks good okay

658
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,520
so that that's really trouble i regret

659
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,120
brett i didn't print out all the

660
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,360
wonderful emails that i got from friends

661
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,039
in new york city and about their

662
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,600
experiences so when you think about that

663
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,400
in the con context of today when

664
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,360
somebody asks you hey we learned in

665
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,440
school about the last time a pandemic

666
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,600
occurred what do you remember think

667
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,000
about what is happening right now

668
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,880
and

669
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,400
look at the pictures that are being

670
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,799
posted and imagine looking at these in

671
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,360
20 years what would you talk about them

672
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,120
what would you say to somebody about

673
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,520
them so when i'm talking about getting

674
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,240
started i'm going to talk about

675
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,440
things to get you started today

676
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,480
the first thing we're going to talk

677
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,120
about is selecting so select what you

678
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,360
are preserving it's important to think

679
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,760
about what is commonplace now which

680
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,080
might be different in many years

681
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,159
um what car are you driving what house

682
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,799
do you live in you select the best photo

683
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,480
and then you select the best part of

684
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,400
this photo so i'm actually putting

685
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,480
together a page now called quarantine

686
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,440
nights

687
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,080
it's a partner to a page that

688
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,720
starts with covid days and hopefully if

689
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,559
you all can see this this is kind of

690
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,400
what my full picture looks like but the

691
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,240
only part i'm interested in is the

692
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,640
bottom part of the photo so what i do

693
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,559
when i'm selecting the parts of the

694
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,640
photo is i actually use a little paper

695
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
cutter because it makes it much easier

696
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,080
for me

697
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,360
and i just line it up and i say okay

698
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,679
i'm selecting that part of the photo

699
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,520
now it's this big

700
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,960
and that gives me a little more room on

701
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,760
my page as i'm doing things

702
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,919
and i selected that part of the photo

703
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,600
because the top part is not important

704
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,480
what is important is when the pandemic

705
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,720
began i had to move my desk and move

706
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
into this corner of the room

707
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,760
and so that helps me focus on things the

708
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,520
second part of what you're going to try

709
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,720
to do is to mount and that means picking

710
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,039
what i put this on

711
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,400
um

712
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,960
and how i do it so i tend to stick with

713
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,440
what are called tape runners

714
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,679
which is essentially a tool like this

715
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,440
and it's got a little sticky thing on it

716
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,360
and i hold on to the

717
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,120
this part of it and i stick it on the

718
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,919
picture and that gives me

719
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,400
a line of kind of double-sided tape on

720
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,640
the back

721
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,799
and i do that because that's a tool i'm

722
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,880
used to there's lots of different tools

723
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,399
you can use and i'm certainly not a snob

724
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,720
about what you're doing

725
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,480
i'm a fan of them but there's lots of

726
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,720
options so mountain corners you may want

727
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,840
to remove

728
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
if their photos you may want to remove

729
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,919
at some point are good because those are

730
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,799
you can take in and out photo mounting

731
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,360
sleeves are also good you want to also

732
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,840
think a little bit about your background

733
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,080
because your page can be quite

734
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,480
overwhelming and big and what i've done

735
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,600
in this case is i've used what i i call

736
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,919
kind of this pop of color here on the

737
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,559
side can y'all see that i don't know

738
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,279
um

739
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,159
and i do that because i try to make sure

740
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,279
that the

741
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,520
blank space is not overwhelming and it

742
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,120
can add to my story

743
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,039
the third step is to think about

744
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,880
journaling

745
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,640
um when you think about journaling

746
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,320
this is where people tend to get a

747
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,240
little squirrely and including me i used

748
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
to get a little bit squirrely about it

749
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,399
because pictures are worth a thousand

750
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,320
words but what we're trying to do here

751
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,399
is preserve the story so you need to

752
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,240
make sure you tell it

753
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,000
the great thing is you don't have to do

754
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,399
it all at the same time and you can pick

755
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,480
the ways

756
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,159
people get squirrely here because a lot

757
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,520
of people tell me they hate their

758
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,919
handwriting they want to type it up so

759
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,399
it looks neat don't do that

760
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,480
and the reason i tell you don't do that

761
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,279
is because i keep my dad's old notebook

762
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,200
just so i can read his handwriting so

763
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
trust me that that handwriting is

764
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,279
somebody's is going to be somebody's

765
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,520
treasured memory later on

766
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,840
um the

767
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,399
you don't want to wait for some day when

768
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,080
you can type it up because some day

769
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,120
never comes so get your words down pen

770
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,039
does make a difference make sure it is

771
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,600
waterproof fade resistant and permanent

772
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,919
now you can say i'm not a person who

773
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,080
does a lot of writing that's okay

774
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,840
there's lots of different ways that you

775
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,640
can

776
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,200
journal and in this page see i have a

777
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,880
picture i don't know am i too close if i

778
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,919
do that

779
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,320
there's a picture of my husband and i um

780
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,080
it was about two

781
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,159
probably february of 2000 and we're in

782
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,159
colorado but if you look at the picture

783
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,520
you won't actually know that right so

784
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,240
if you capture the story in bullets uh i

785
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,720
tell you it's february this is the view

786
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,039
from buffalo bill's grave

787
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,799
we're on the colorado mountain and i'm

788
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,480
there because i was training with

789
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,039
african affiliates in denver that's a

790
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,679
way that works fine there i could also

791
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,080
just do a quick caption george and i

792
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,399
take a break from playing american tour

793
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,240
guides for the african affiliates to

794
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,559
enjoy the colorado scenery

795
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,039
i know what i'm doing i know where i am

796
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,960
and then i can do a much longer

797
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,840
storyteller if that's important to me so

798
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,080
think about your captions and your

799
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
journaling and think about what that

800
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,240
means to you

801
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,919
the last thing you want to sort of think

802
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,399
about is enhancing and this is where you

803
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,279
get to enhance your story a little bit

804
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,240
my favorite way to do this is to soften

805
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,799
the edges of my photograph and i do that

806
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,399
you see these sharp edges

807
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,320
with what's called a corner rounder and

808
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,600
essentially i just pop this in here

809
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,360
and i click here and what happens

810
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,919
is the edges become

811
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,840
rounded

812
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,159
it's a fun and quick way to make sure

813
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,240
that

814
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,360
it's not as harsh and ending

815
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,480
as

816
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,760
other things and there's lots of

817
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,200
different rounders out there i actually

818
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,960
have a christmas one that puts little

819
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,159
christmas trees in the edge of it so

820
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,919
you do that sort of thing and you see

821
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,799
i've already done it for this photograph

822
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,559
here's my other second

823
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,240
buffy reference i don't know if you see

824
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,760
that and

825
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,919
you do that and the other way that you

826
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,880
can enhance is just buy stickers who

827
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,919
doesn't love stickers right and so

828
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,919
i often times just grab a couple

829
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,679
stickers and i kind of put that down

830
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:16,799
here

831
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,120
so then i end up with sort of a page

832
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,279
that looks like this

833
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,760
and this is my quarantine nights page

834
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,159
and it says some nights seemed busier

835
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,200
than pre-covered fancy fridays for mom

836
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,000
and a virtual prom for george so this is

837
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,120
me as i was attending one of alyssa's um

838
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,279
fancy friday nights and that same night

839
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,840
my son ended up with on at his virtual

840
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,960
prom and when we set up his virtual prom

841
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,039
in the background i had set up this

842
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,320
slideshow of prom scenes from famous tv

843
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,360
shows and movies so i had like buffy and

844
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,279
footloose and a couple other things just

845
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,960
kind of playing on rotation in the

846
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,159
background with all of his um

847
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,399
all of his balloons and things like that

848
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,640
and having a husband with photographic

849
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,159
backgrounds was certainly helpful to

850
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,240
this experience so what i'm going to do

851
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,640
with this page is this is my page of the

852
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,120
pictures i'm going to journal entirely

853
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,640
this story on the back of this page

854
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,399
so that helps people kind of think

855
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,080
things through

856
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,879
similarly

857
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,279
this is my

858
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,720
pancakes con page for my 2000 animal i

859
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,519
mean my from my 2020 album so when i say

860
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,559
people love

861
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,200
stickers i always order my stickers

862
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,519
and i get them all up but i've also put

863
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,440
in like pictures from people's

864
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,679
twitter accounts where they were paying

865
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,720
attention to the talks so um and i and

866
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,120
the story that i'm telling on this page

867
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,200
is about how tech people took to the

868
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
internet to leverage their talent and

869
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,159
resources and online conferences such as

870
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,600
pancakes

871
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,320
con supported social distancing while

872
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,559
still sharing information so that's a

873
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,559
memory in 20 years at some point

874
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,559
somebody will have of that

875
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,039
and that's important right now you may

876
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,279
be looking at all this and thinking this

877
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,799
is overwhelming

878
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,799
so think about some of the projects that

879
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,799
you could do right now i'm going to

880
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,720
share some of my favorites that i do

881
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,399
every january the first is if you get

882
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,799
picture cards from the for the holidays

883
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,880
from family

884
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,640
that's wonderful that means somebody

885
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
else has already done the hard work for

886
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,679
you

887
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,440
you want to put them in the album grab

888
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,360
them all

889
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,760
stick a sheet of red down the side and

890
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,640
start sticking them on the pages

891
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,960
it is so fun to see how family grows and

892
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,440
changes over time and gives the kids

893
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,120
something to look at

894
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,039
when they only see their cousins or

895
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,559
their friends

896
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,120
once a year and you can usually finish

897
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,760
these pages by new year's i tell people

898
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,799
this

899
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,640
and originally when i used to tell

900
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,480
people this it was because my kids were

901
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,880
very young and they didn't always have

902
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,279
the long-term memory

903
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,159
that

904
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,640
had them recognizing their teenage

905
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,320
cousins or the other people that we

906
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,159
would see in the summertime or things

907
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,879
like that and so before we went on trips

908
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,320
i would always pull out the christmas

909
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,040
albums and show them

910
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,560
remember

911
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,440
uh cousin andy and cousin karen and

912
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,199
their kids and this is what they look

913
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,800
like and that's awesome

914
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,079
um in recent years i've had a second use

915
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,359
for them as my mother has gotten older

916
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,199
because she doesn't always remember the

917
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,719
context of some of the people and

918
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,800
visitors she has so i can't stress

919
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,280
enough how useful those photo cards are

920
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,119
to people like me who use them for

921
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,040
things like that

922
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,480
and so that's the first thing i would

923
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,399
encourage you someone else has already

924
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,040
done the hard work of selecting photos

925
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,599
and selecting their best parts of those

926
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,079
photos and they've put them on a card

927
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,239
all you need to do is stick that down on

928
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,400
pages you don't even necessarily need to

929
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,320
tell stories at that point because their

930
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,400
names are usually on the cards so i

931
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,119
would encourage you to think about that

932
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,440
the second thing is i am one of those

933
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,040
photo card families and i've been a

934
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,200
photo card family since i originally got

935
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,800
married and that's fine

936
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,359
um and originally when you did photo

937
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,560
cards you could only have one picture so

938
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,200
when i started scrapbooking i would in

939
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,520
fact

940
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,320
put together a page

941
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,160
that became my photo card and take a

942
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,320
picture of that page so this would be

943
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,000
the page i would put together and then

944
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,680
my photo card would end up looking

945
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
something like this

946
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,560
and what i started doing this is my my

947
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,119
picture from my husband and i in orlando

948
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,079
and under

949
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,839
what i started doing that year in 2001

950
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,040
is

951
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,760
laminating these on a sheet of

952
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,240
double-sided wrapping paper to make a

953
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,119
placemat so this 11 by 17 sheet of paper

954
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,960
i would laminate it and that would give

955
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,720
me a placement a wipe down placemat

956
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,040
well times have changed technology has

957
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,880
changed now you're not limited to one

958
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,880
thing so it's actually much easier for

959
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,760
me

960
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,599
so i now do this same thing and i

961
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,079
have had to change the paper in the 20

962
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,520
years i've been doing it because i ran

963
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,359
out of paper off the first roll so now

964
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,440
i'm on blue paper but i do the same

965
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,480
thing and i stick my my pictures on here

966
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,280
my cards on here and on the back i

967
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,200
actually now put the letter that i send

968
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,440
along with my photo card and what that

969
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,440
means is now i have

970
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,920
20 placemats which is good but i also

971
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,160
have these kind of 20 20 years of

972
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,839
memories where again i've already done

973
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,480
the hard work i selected the photos to

974
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,880
put them on the card so you know what

975
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
i'm just gonna laminate it and stick it

976
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,680
there and again loads of fun there's

977
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,240
nothing so much fun is having your high

978
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,359
school child come and bring their their

979
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,280
girlfriend or boyfriend over and be able

980
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,880
to stick out these

981
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,640
placemats from when they were very

982
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,320
little so that's fun so that's the

983
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,480
second project that i would recommend to

984
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,800
people to sort of think about

985
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,599
um

986
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,880
but there's

987
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,280
because the technology has changed since

988
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,280
i started this i'll also encourage you

989
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,359
to think of more things start on a much

990
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,880
smaller scale

991
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,800
is there a favorite trip or a favorite

992
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,640
memory or maybe just

993
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,280
about quarantine and and covet in

994
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,359
general is a time period you want to

995
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,839
kind of put things together and when you

996
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,079
do that there are many many services

997
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,760
where you can kind of put together a

998
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,560
book

999
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,119
that just captures those

1000
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,200
pictures and you can send them digitally

1001
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,359
to a service and it'll put it together

1002
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,880
so this is um

1003
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,680
many years ago we i took my kids and we

1004
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,079
we took a barge down the erie canal and

1005
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,000
this is kind of our trip down there i

1006
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
didn't do heavy journaling except for

1007
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,400
the first page where i explained about

1008
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,800
the trip and then the rest of it is just

1009
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
pictures of our journey

1010
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,560
um and

1011
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,280
actually lyrics from the sounds the song

1012
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
low bridge everybody down i don't know

1013
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,200
if people know that song but

1014
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,960
it's now playing in my head so there you

1015
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,280
go you might get me to break into song

1016
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,560
after all but it it just captures that

1017
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,200
moment in time for me

1018
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,359
finally

1019
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,560
if we are sort of our well-curated

1020
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,880
social media people

1021
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,119
you're already doing the hard work

1022
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,599
um you're already picking and choosing

1023
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,839
what you want to share and what you

1024
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,160
think will will be important for the

1025
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,240
future and when you do that sort of

1026
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,359
thing

1027
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,520
um you should find a way to preserve it

1028
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,160
so again there's lots of opportunities

1029
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,119
and lots of services that will do that

1030
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,480
my aunt

1031
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,800
before she passed away was actually an

1032
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,520
archivist down in new orleans and the

1033
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,480
last time she was visiting dc was

1034
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
actually to see what she considered her

1035
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,520
letter um at smithsonian she had loaned

1036
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,680
it to the smithsonian for one of their

1037
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,599
their um

1038
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,920
displays and so she came up and we went

1039
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,599
down to the smithsonian we got into a

1040
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,119
big discussion about how because so many

1041
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,760
people have their memories digitally how

1042
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,000
do we preserve them for the future and i

1043
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,760
told her that what i do at the end of

1044
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,000
every year is i take a dump of all my

1045
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,240
social media posts and i essentially

1046
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,839
throw them into a book

1047
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,480
um and i do that and the books are

1048
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
varying lengths but i do it on the 1st

1049
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,119
of january every year and the book goes

1050
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,440
from last january first to this january

1051
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,160
1st and it essentially pulls in all my

1052
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,880
social media posts and tells me

1053
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,119
you know what my comment was and the

1054
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,400
picture that i sent at that point um

1055
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,720
and sometimes there are other things i

1056
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,800
shared like this one which is my one of

1057
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,640
my favorite muppet episodes with gilda

1058
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,440
radner in it and sometimes there are

1059
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,240
things that are happening right then so

1060
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,880
i do that every year i pull it out and

1061
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,280
in the past year since

1062
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,920
my daughter's been home

1063
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,839
in the pandemic and my son has gone off

1064
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,680
to school she's been flipping through

1065
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,040
them and kind of pulling out her

1066
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,680
favorite pictures to send to people

1067
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,760
because it is much easier to flip

1068
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,440
through a book and find what you're

1069
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,119
referencing than to try to go back

1070
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,400
with

1071
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,040
you know 5 000 photos and find the one

1072
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,640
photo you're looking at you've already

1073
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,560
done the hard work you've curated for

1074
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,800
for your social media feed i would

1075
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,119
encourage you to find a way to preserve

1076
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,680
that in a much more sustainable way

1077
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,480
um if not for yourself then with them

1078
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,079
for those of us that at some point will

1079
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,560
be good looking for that information so

1080
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,040
think about that the point is to find a

1081
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,920
lasting way to preserve your stories

1082
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,280
they are yours and will give many

1083
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,680
different perspectives on the past that

1084
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,440
will be treasured in ways you can't even

1085
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,200
begin to imagine

1086
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,280
based on kind of where we are right now

1087
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,240
and where we're headed the whole

1088
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,760
unprecedented times can make it super

1089
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,000
uncomfortable to to to

1090
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,920
talk to your kids about right now but

1091
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,319
think about how much harder it will be

1092
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,680
to talk to them about it in 15 years

1093
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,119
which is when

1094
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,560
they get into high school and they'll

1095
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,000
come back and start asking you because

1096
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,520
they won't remember if they're super

1097
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,359
young

1098
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,880
but your

1099
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,960
your ability to capture that information

1100
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,480
right now is really gonna make a

1101
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,119
difference in the future

1102
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,720
okay so that's sort of where i am how am

1103
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,280
i doing on time

1104
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,520
got four minutes i've got four minutes

1105
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,599
i'm happy to take questions i'll slide

1106
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,319
back here if if there's any questions i

1107
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,560
want you to know that uh i'm sure

1108
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,880
everybody loved your presentation as

1109
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,720
much as i did and and that they

1110
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,560
thoroughly paid attention

1111
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,599
but

1112
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,760
most of the chat was heavily buffy

1113
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,920
oriented

1114
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,000
well hopefully everybody got my buffy

1115
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,599
references then

1116
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,520
my son said to me nobody's ever going to

1117
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,800
catch willow when i was in the

1118
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,280
background there mom

1119
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,359
he underestimated the amount of fans

1120
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,440
at this con so

1121
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,160
yes they did

1122
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,920
yes they did

1123
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,319
you can always count on me to sneak in a

1124
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:17,200
fluffy reference or two so yeah

1125
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,119
i actually used to have a talk called

1126
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,800
everything i learned about information

1127
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,240
security i learned from buffy the

1128
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,960
vampire slayer oh my gosh do you have it

1129
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,480
is there a recording or a link

1130
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,000
maybe i'll submit that next year ah

1131
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,079
that's too bad

1132
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,599
all right yeah you need to do that one

1133
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,800
next okay

1134
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,640
um let's see i you know i personally

1135
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,560
just wanted to say like i appreciated

1136
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,400
your like warning

1137
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,960
if you cannot do all of these or none of

1138
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,319
these everything is okay still um

1139
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,800
so that was really great to hear

1140
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,079
um i know a lot of people are struggling

1141
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,839
right and and that's the point like

1142
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,319
build your community to support you

1143
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,920
and find your way to support them back

1144
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,240
at the pace that is available to you i

1145
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,319
totally agree

1146
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,400
um and then you mentioned tara wheeler's

1147
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,960
book which is i can confirm an amazing

1148

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,800
do you

1153
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,440

1154
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,000
together now or in the past or no so

1155
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
when i was had semantic tarot was at

1156

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:46,960
like

1166
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,440
did anyone get bonuses after helping

1167
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,760
with vlog4j and people were just like

1168
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,520
people got bonuses and a lot of people

1169
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,280
were like i didn't even get a thank you

1170
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,640

1171
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,160

1172
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,440
yes i mean again whatever you can do

1173
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,079
believe me it's recognized so

1174
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,400
yep

1175
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,560
someone asked if they don't have a big

1176
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,160
following on twitter and i know a lot of

1177
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,599
people already replied but if they don't

1178
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:12,720
have a big following on twitter is it

1179
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,640
worth to like post um things you're

1180
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,720
working on or advice you may have and

1181
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,880
things like that absolutely because you

1182
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,280
don't get a a following on twitter

1183
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,920
unless you start posting on twitter so

1184
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,880
it's one of those things especially um

1185
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,079
if you're

1186
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,640
if you're cross-promoting so then

1187
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,119
because of what you're interested in and

1188
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,680
you're working on if you

1189
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,200
then say

1190
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,000
