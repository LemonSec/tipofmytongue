1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,960
we have basic rfid tag cloning and

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,040
antique camera photography with gabe

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,720
skyler hi gabe

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,040
hey how's it going good how are you

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,719
i'm good

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,679
uh let me share my slides and uh

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,679
let's talk about some

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,400
new tech and some old tech and uh

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,520
let's

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,920
let's get into some trouble here

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,600
um okay

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,439
so

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,400
my talk is about rfid typhooning and

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,960
anti-camera photography um

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,719
i'm calling this a two-step dance on the

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,440
electromagnetic spectrum because they're

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,280
both on the electromagnetic spectrum

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,480
i'll get into that in a second

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,360
here's me gabe skyler i've been in ops

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,399
for

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,280
ever

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,600
i've been in devops i worked at puppet

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
labs for seven years

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,000
um and then most recently kind of into

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,239
infosec but i'm a constant tinkerer

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,800
so i've always been uh messing around

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,600
with stuff whether it was rfid tags or

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,359
antique cameras just always really

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,520
curious uh so

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,799
join me with the curiosity here

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,560
here's why i call it a two-step is

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,840
because first i'm going to talk about

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,080
radio that's on this end of the

34
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,240
electromagnetic spectrum

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,159
and then we're going to talk about light

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,320
so they are actually the same darn

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,240
things they're just on different ends of

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,880
the spectrum

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,960
all right let's start out with rfid

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,560
that's just short for radio frequency

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,920
identification

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
uh these are things used for access

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,479
control uh personal id

44
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,880
like your your id for for office when we

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,400
used to have those

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,960
payment cards um things like a transit

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,200
card will frequently use radio frequency

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,640
identification

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,680
and these are passive rfid formats which

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,880
means they don't they don't even need a

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,520
battery or anything come in all sorts of

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,960
form factors

53
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,720
the one you're looking at right here is

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,719
actually the impetus for me getting into

55
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,320
rfid at all

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,040
which was that i i ride

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
but my building's garage door needs an

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,759
rfid tag to actually get in

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,239
but as as you can sort of tell from this

60
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,360
uh trying to fumble first rfid tag with

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,440
gloves on on a vehicle that requires

62
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,000
both hands to actually you know manage

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,319
um was a little tricky so i decided you

64
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,959
know what i've heard that these are so

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,720
easy to copy i've probably boasted that

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
these are so easy to copy

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,120
to friends um so let's put my money

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,959
where my mouth is and i'm gonna i'm

69
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,239
gonna start copying some more if i

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,720
detect

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,680
let's uh let's start with how they how

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,519
they work in the first place um this

73
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,160
will be passive rfid uh that's an

74
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
interesting thing uh because that means

75
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,800
that your your tag or your card or your

76
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,160
key fob

77
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,440
doesn't have a power source to itself

78
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,280
and so the

79
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,360
comparison that people will make

80
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,640
is is to a flashlight or or a lighthouse

81
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,959
um something that you can you can pulse

82
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,120
at a normal rate but you could also like

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,040
spell out in morse code or binary of

84
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,959
some sort a message

85
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,000
um and then someone went to a mirror

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,959
so

87
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,720
if i wanted to talk to you i've got a

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
flashlight but you don't

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,239
you can imagine a situation where i

90
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,640
could blink my light i could do you know

91
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,519
send a binary message but then if i were

92
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,560
then to say okay your turn and just send

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,040
an even pulse

94
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,040
you could use the mirror to reflect or

95
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,040
not reflect that pulse

96
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
selectively and you could actually tell

97
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,560
me a message back

98
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,040
vast oversimplification um but that's

99
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,360
the idea here is that that the the

100
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,560
reader has the blinking light um and

101
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,280
then the card could borrow that energy

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,040
to actually make a message go back as

103
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,840
well

104
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
your rfid tags are

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,560
are

106
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,879
going to go at a certain frequency

107
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,200
that's just the speed that the the

108
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
lighthouse is spinning at

109
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,319
and the two most commonly you're going

110
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,680
to see for things like access

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
technologies

112
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,760
are 125 kilohertz and 13.56 megahertz

113
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,599
uh you'll probably just want to do some

114
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,439
research to figure out which ones yours

115
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,920
are uh all this stuff is pretty pretty

116
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,879
public

117
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,040
um but if you want to look cool

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
there are actually easy ways to detect

119
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
since after all the reader

120
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
is the flashlight and it's sending out

121
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,840
energy

122
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,000
all you really need in in the case of

123
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,240
what i'm showing here is a card with an

124
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,720
led that can pick up that energy

125
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,600
and just

126
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
channel it into an led

127
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,199
so what you're seeing here is is

128
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,120
actually the reader on the garage door

129
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,520
that i've got and i'm just holding up

130
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,600
something that's the same exact format

131
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,560
as a

132
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
credit card and it's telling me that

133
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,720
this one uses low frequency

134
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,400
so it's super easy to just figure it out

135
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,320
on your own if you want

136
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,599
also you kind of feel like best buy

137
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,040
so that's the flashlight how does the

138
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,560
mirror work somebody's got to flash that

139
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,560
like back it's got to read things it's

140
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,479
got a answer to it and that's what's

141
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,639
called a chip set

142
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,759
if you look

143
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,160
in here i've got a whole bunch of form

144
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,880
factors that i'm looking at but here

145
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,840
inside this one is a loop that's a coil

146
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,199
it's an antenna

147
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,000
then there's a teeny little chip

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,039
so it's taking in the pulses and then

149
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,840
doing some processing and answering

150
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,199
you'll find that

151
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,520
that access keys are generally pretty

152
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,880
simple

153
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,360
unless somebody's invested a whole bunch

154
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,240
but i'm my apartment building

155
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,160
they're a little cheap

156
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,440
uh

157
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
what i've been finding and don't quote

158
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,320
me i'm just a tinkerer uh is that the

159
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,720
lower frequency ones tend to be simpler

160
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,520
here just a few examples of the chips uh

161
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,039
they're not encrypted they're they're

162
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,960
really just identifying themselves with

163
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,400
a number

164
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
and the reader is trusting that

165
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,639
whereas from the ones i've found the

166
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,800
higher frequency ones are a little

167
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,199
fancier they may have encryption uh they

168
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,199
can be written to

169
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,840
it's just just the trend i've seen there

170
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,800
so mine's a low frequency

171
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,680
and

172
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
i can just get right into solving the

173
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,360
problem

174
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,080
so

175
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,919
what i thought to myself was well how

176
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,479
far can i get if i go onto ebay

177
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,479
i've looked up my key i know that it

178
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,440
uses the

179
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,560
tm-5577 chipset that's a low frequency

180
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
why don't i just go on ebay and find

181
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,240
something and i did

182
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,440
and

183
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,840
this is a perfectly acceptable answer i

184
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,160
know we're all hackers and and

185
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,240
and uh orienting this towards people who

186
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,319
are learning stuff we all want to learn

187
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,560
stuff but sometimes you just need to get

188
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,240
the job done

189
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,520
don't worry i'm going to get more

190
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,400
exciting

191
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,360
but

192
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,400
on ebay 10 bucks this thing's cheap

193
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,919
it just works

194
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,759
uh it's chipset specific so i had to

195
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,759
know my chipset my frequency

196
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,599
but it works if all you need to do is

197
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,599
copy a couple of these things what do

198
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,759
you do it even comes with spares

199
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,960
spare key fobs for you

200
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,319
these also are kind of notorious for

201
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,599
playing some shenanigans

202
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,360
once i started to get into the more

203
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,880
advanced stuff and actually looking at

204
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,360
the data on the cards

205
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,759
i realized that this little thing

206
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,759
sets a password on the key fob and some

207
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,599
of them will actually set it

208
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,680
read only so you can only ever use this

209
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,880
thing once

210
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,400
unless you know what password the

211
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,319
manufacturer used

212
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,639
to sort of give you this rudimentary

213
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,919
vendor lock-in

214
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,800
so

215
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,960
you just need to copy things who cares

216
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,440
but if you really want to play around

217
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,240
spend a couple bucks more or borrow from

218
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,840
somebody

219
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,799
one of these guys

220
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,240
this is the prox mark iii

221
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,599
pretty much the only thing i found that

222
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,720
really just makes things easy usually i

223
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,280
would be vendor neutral

224
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,000
i have a vendor neutral but this vendor

225
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,080
or this design is really great it is

226
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,400
open source so

227
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,160
somewhat vendor agnostic in that sense

228
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,599
that you can get them from a bunch of

229
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,280
different places

230
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,120
with either the firmware already built

231
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,319
in there or not

232
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,800
some assembly will be required to kind

233
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,680
of

234
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,240
get your setup working

235
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,720
you'll be connecting to it with a usb

236
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,639
modem interface sometimes

237
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,879
but it really does do it all

238
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,560
what you're looking at

239
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,599
is this red coil is an antenna

240
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,519
for the low frequency there's also an

241
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,760
antenna for the high frequency

242
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,919
and it really can just read pretty much

243
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,240
anything write pretty much anything

244
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,480
if a card's encrypted you're going to

245
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,800
have to do a little more work

246
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
but for something like my

247
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,080
building block

248
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,040
it's actually just so so rudimentary

249
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,640
that it's it just works

250
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,560
so what i did was i read my card

251
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,440
and this is my key on the low frequency

252
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,760
antenna i'm reading it

253
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
here's a readout of what's going on the

254
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,839
software no that's not my actual number

255
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,519
but what you're looking at here is a

256
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,040
facility code

257
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,360
which is basically building number you

258
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
can think of it that way and then card

259
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,000
number which is really more to identify

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,040
you

261
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,880
and actually with a five-digit number

262
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,320
here you can actually imagine this as

263
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,000
the pinnings of a key

264
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,720
um that that these are the the settings

265
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,240
for it so just like a hardware key just

266
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,320
like a normal key that you would have

267
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,080
metal key

268
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,640
we also have a static identity right

269
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,680
here that you can copy

270
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,359
it's really quite simple

271
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,760
and then you just write it

272
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,399
so i did my research um

273
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,320
also when i read

274
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,680
i could see

275
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,399
what type of chip i was using

276
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,959
and then just to write it

277
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,399
very simple

278
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,200
just told the prox mark 3 to write it

279
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,000
and here's me writing my facility code i

280
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,680
have my card number

281
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,279
and then i'm also telling it how to

282
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,959
encode this

283
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,560
because it said it's a hidden card with

284
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,800
that encoding

285
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
tons of form factors

286
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,560
and i think when i started out this

287
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,200
really was what i was going for was

288
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
that key that i had the blue one that

289
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,040
you see over on the right side

290
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,839
is pretty bulky

291
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,519
and i've copied a few of these for my

292
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,519
friends as well and there are reasons

293
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,800
that you want to have a different form

294
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,839
factor same frequencies and chipsets

295
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,040
and key fobs and cards

296
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,200
and in my key

297
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,600
you can also get injectable

298
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,560
chips

299
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,640
um this is actually what veterinarians

300
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,120
use when they chip your your your dogs

301
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,440
or your cats or whatever

302
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,079
is there actually just using an rfid tag

303
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,600
that's small enough to be injected

304
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,240
you can also do this to humans

305
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,440
but i was not in the mood for that

306
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,880
to be honest though actually i was gonna

307
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,920
i was going to purchase one of the

308
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,560
injectable ones because they're small

309
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
and then try to sew it onto my glove

310
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,959
something like that

311
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,920
which is

312
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,079
interesting because incidentally wookie

313
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,680
is doing leather working

314
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
on track 2 right now so we've got

315
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,240
something in common on our talks

316
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,320
what ended up working for me

317
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,160
was that you can actually get a ring for

318
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,279
your finger

319
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,240
actually i've got it on right now

320
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,959
that has that that chipset and the

321
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,360
antenna in it antenna is a loop after

322
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,360
all so very simple

323
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,399
to embed that into a ceramic ring

324
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,160
so my problem of

325
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,480
i have this key i have gloves it's all

326
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,720
really annoying is that now i just put

327
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,079
on this ring when i go out riding

328
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,959
and when i get back

329
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,000
i just

330
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,920
wave my hand at the reader and the

331
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,479
garage door opens

332
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,399
so that was my solution to my situation

333
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,480
and here's my encouragement to you

334
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,519
is

335
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,720
to

336
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,959
have fun with this as well

337
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,320
all you really have to do is a little

338
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,800
bit of research to figure out which chip

339
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
set and which frequency you're looking

340
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,800
at

341
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,360
it's okay to go the cheap route i think

342
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,600
anybody's going to judge you in fact

343
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,440
your friends who don't know about rfid

344
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,040
are probably gonna be amazed

345
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,480
that you pulled out this little blue

346
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,600
thing and copied their key for them

347
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,959
the fancy stuff is fun i will admit that

348
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,959
um leads to some interesting rabbit

349
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,399
holes

350
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,279
my key is similar to

351
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,600
probably three quarters of my friends

352
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,639
keys

353
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,160
which is that it's a very simple chip

354
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,880
with just the facility code

355
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,399
and the card number

356
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,120
super easy to copy however the other

357
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,959
quarter of my friends have

358
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,600
uh typically they're high frequency but

359
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,760
interesting cards that actually have

360
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,320
encryption or that write a value to the

361
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,959
card every time it's used

362
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,360
so those are fun

363
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,760
but i'm i'm not going to be i'm not

364
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,360
going to be copying them anytime soon

365
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,600
probably

366
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,399
and

367
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,360
it

368
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,680
it really is fun i i did add amazing

369
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,519
friends uh miss fire enemies here

370
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,760
because it really is a lot of fun

371
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,920
to show people how this stuff works i

372
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,959
think it's

373
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,800
it's similar to the first lockpick

374
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,959
village that you go to

375
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,959
where you realize that

376
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,680
the

377
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,760
the internal workings of this thing

378
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,680
that's supposed to be

379
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,920
trustable

380
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,040
are

381
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,399
not as fancy as you thought

382
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,760
just because it's a computer and you

383
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,360
can't see inside it doesn't mean you

384
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,120
can't figure out what's inside it and do

385
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,360
something to it

386
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,560
so

387
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,320
really do encourage you to

388
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,800
to play with this stuff um if you've got

389
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,680
if you've got the the chance to

390
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,199
but hopefully at least you have an

391
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,639
understanding now

392
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,199
that the uh the technology isn't all

393
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,920
that tricky and that when you say to

394
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,600
your friends oh yeah those things are so

395
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,360
easy to copy

396
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,639
they actually are

397
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,320
and you can kind of back that up a

398
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,079
little bit and say yeah there was

399
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,480
there's this dude showed us a motorcycle

400
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,680
thing with the the rings

401
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,040
let's flip this flapjack all right

402
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,279
rfid is fun let's get to the other end

403
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,959
of the spectrum uh which is going to be

404
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,560
nc cameras

405
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,360
um

406
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,920
the impetus for this one

407
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,040
uh is really interesting i just um

408
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,399
i was at a

409
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,680
swap meet

410
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,560
and

411
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,120
saw a anti-camera

412
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,560
and did one or ten bucks for it um

413
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,240
he was willing to accept five bucks for

414
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,959
it

415
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,320
uh the thing was

416
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,399
pretty dirty and grimy but i figured you

417
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,560
know it looked nice

418
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,399
it was a while ago but these days it

419
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,480
would be you know in my zoom room that

420
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,399
would have been where i bought it um and

421
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,720
then once i got home with it i realized

422
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,079
that this little five dollar piece of

423
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,720
junk actually still works

424
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,199
and so it sort of sent me on a trip

425
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,160
to

426
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,639
the other end of the uh the em spectrum

427
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,440
here

428
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,079
uh and a different time as well so all

429
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,480
the way back to uh the early 1900s

430
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,800
looking at these things

431
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,079
and it's really not that hard to do

432
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,480
so

433
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,720
to give the same treatment

434
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,120
as the rfid how does it work

435
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,880
um

436
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,199
i i grew up with film cameras i know a

437
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,560
lot of people didn't

438
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,040
especially if you're a student right now

439
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
um so let me just give you this super

440
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,880
oversimplified view just like with rfid

441
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,279
which is that um well all we're doing is

442
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,199
we're taking visible light in

443
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,600
to a box

444
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,519
the light going into the box goes

445
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,680
through a lens so it creates an image on

446
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,759
the back of the box

447
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,399
and then we have film in there

448
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,839
and

449
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,000
film i think the easiest way to describe

450
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
how film works

451
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,639
is it's similar to getting a somewhere

452
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,839
is that

453
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,199
if there's something that's photo

454
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,720
sensitive on the back here and that's

455
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,680
the film

456
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,519
or if there's something like you know

457
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,240
your arm that's photosensitive

458
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,480
and you apply different amounts of light

459
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,519
to it

460
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,079
it's going to actually store that image

461
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,240
so if you imagine you know writing

462
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,959
things in sunscreen on your arm or

463
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,120
scraping it off maybe signing your name

464
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,199
on your arm and then you go and you get

465
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,399
sunburned the places that get more light

466
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,759
uh because they didn't have as much

467
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,839
sunscreen are gonna be darker and the

468
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,759
places that uh didn't get a lot of light

469
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,000
are gonna be light that's really all

470
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,399
that's going on with film uh it's really

471
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,119
nothing all that fancy it's just here's

472
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,880
something out here that i see

473
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,640
light comes in it's something that's

474
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,799
photosensitive and then later i use

475
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,959
chemicals to just fix that

476
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,480
at the spot it is

477
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,880
right there

478
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,280
so super simple that's why a five dollar

479
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,319
piece of junk actually still works

480
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,319
uh before you get into fancy cameras uh

481
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,760
or junkie cameras i guess in my case

482
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,880
um

483
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,000
you will need to accept that uh chaos

484
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,679
is gonna happen

485
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,640
um

486
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,880
film is sensitive to light

487
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,400
you're gonna

488
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,039
fumble it and drop it uh you're gonna

489
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,280
try to change the film around in total

490
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,240
darkness so it doesn't get an image uh

491
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,640
it's not going to work

492
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,520
old cameras leak light into them so

493
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,039
you're not just getting the image that's

494
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,120
out there you're getting like the crack

495
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,960
in this side of it

496
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,720
especially the old ones

497
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,000
um

498
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,200
the

499
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,320
they

500
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,480
they are not um automatically adjusting

501
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,679
for the amount of light that's coming in

502
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,600
you're gonna have to do a lot of guesses

503
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,280
uh so you're gonna end up with photos

504
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,440
that are completely blown out because

505
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,919
too much light came in

506
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,760
film has to be wound between shots

507
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,440
you're going to forget

508
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,799
in the upper right here is a double

509
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,960
exposure because i took two photos at

510
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,080
the same piece of film

511
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,799
my five dollar camera was certainly full

512
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,080
of mold

513
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,520
um but really to to to uh invoke bob

514
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,400
ross

515
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,080
um

516
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,919
you don't get into this stuff because

517
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,320
you're afraid of mistakes

518
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,520
there aren't mistakes that are happy

519
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,799
accidents

520
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,960
and i picked sort of some representative

521
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,480
photos here of

522
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,039
uh blown out bamboo well that's kind of

523
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,760
cool high contrast uh mold in the lower

524
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,880
left here

525
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,440
i don't know kind of looks cool

526
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,919
blurry things double exposures

527
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,080
these are all going to be part of it

528
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,480
and and i think one of the one of the

529
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,559
fun things about these uh happy

530
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,400
accidents so to speak

531
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,679
is that you're going to get people on

532
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,000
whatever social media feed you have

533
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,320
asking you how the heck you did that and

534
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,400
what filter you used

535
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,559
and the answer is i really just used a

536
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,520
whole bunch of metal do

537
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,640
let's talk about some of these devices

538
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,840
that you get for five bucks

539
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,160
this is the pocket codec

540
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
this is really one of the first attempts

541
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,960
to democratize photography

542
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,200
to make a camera that could be used with

543
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,120
a pretty simple film

544
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,919
and with pretty simple mechanism

545
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,000
it is collapsible

546
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,760
so what you're seeing here is the

547
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,320
bellows so it actually collapses down to

548
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,720
a pretty small size

549
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,280
i would not try to fit it into most

550
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,160
pockets a jacket pocket probably work uh

551
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,440
certainly not fashionable pair of jeans

552
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,840
collapsible so easy to take around

553
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,880
has a little kickstand on it

554
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,440
older cameras and older film

555
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
take a while to actually burn in that

556
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,480
image

557
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,080
so you need to hold them still so this

558
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,559
is designed for a normal person to just

559
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,159
stand it up

560
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,480
it's facing straight forward then

561
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,559
and then use the shutter without having

562
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,520
to actually hold it still

563
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
you will

564
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,679
get to use your dremel on some of these

565
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,919
uh the more you do the more more

566
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,200
wonderful

567
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,280
uh chances you're gonna have to justify

568
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,679
buying a really nice dremel

569
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,240
sometimes spools of film

570
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,919
don't exist anymore you have to take one

571
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,400
that does exist shave off pieces of it

572
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,280
you can have you can have a lot of fun

573
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,679
don't be afraid to break these they are

574
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,679
democratized they are built

575
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,080
uh for people to to mess with them

576
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,400
these are the sorts of photos that i got

577
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,679
out of this guy

578
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,640
um

579
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,600
also dozens of photos that didn't look

580
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,880
uh

581
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,320
like this um blown out uh things where

582
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,679
it was in my pocket but it was really

583
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,480
bright sunlight outside leaks came in

584
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,039
but i did end up with with some fun ones

585
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,039
um and again this is this is kind of

586
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,880
where your friends say hey hey what

587
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,280
filter did you use that's that's kind of

588
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,960
cool like that looks sort of like creepy

589
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,360
and old

590
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,760
uh let me go back here

591
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,240
and the pocket kodak was 1900's to the

592
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,919
30s

593
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,240
there was a span where kodak made the

594
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,760
vest pocket

595
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,600
and this was from the 10s to the 20s

596
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,360
through the 20s

597
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,840
this was specifically built

598
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,799
to be quote the soldier's camera it's

599
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,120
nice and small

600
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,760
it's uh actually around the size of a

601
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,240
smartphone maybe the max version but

602
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,840
still

603
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,080
and there are a ton of these

604
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,960
they are cheap when there's not a

605
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,039
bidding bubble going on ebay if they're

606
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,640
cheap at a flea market they should be at

607
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,240
most 20 bucks

608
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,120
um

609
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,530
they

610
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,799
[Music]

611
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,640
didn't age all that well so you are

612
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,120
gonna want like some gaffers tape to

613
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,440
tape over anything where you think light

614
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,520
might be leaking in

615
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,200
it won't be a perfect job

616
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,240
so

617
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
so again get ready for those happy

618
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,640
accidents

619
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,400
and here's the results of that this one

620
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,240
was actually in pretty good shape so i

621
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,760
was able to take a pretty clear image

622
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,159
here of my franchesca

623
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,320
this was actually indoors

624
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,440
she looks slightly bemused because

625
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,840
the film takes a while to expose so she

626
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,000
actually had to sit still there

627
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,600
so this was like five seconds of her

628
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,360
being like okay gabe all right fine

629
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,840
i've got an outdoor picture here

630
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,480
these these white spots this is where

631
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,799
light was leaking in where my gapper's

632
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,400
tape was not quite doing the job

633
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,520
and then here's a fun one these cameras

634
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
were designed with black and white film

635
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,280
in mind

636
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,080
so they made choices about the lenses

637
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,240
and they made choices about

638
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,080
where the film was going to go through

639
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,679
informed only by the idea that they were

640
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,520
going to be doing black and white

641
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,600
which i guess is that sunburn as well is

642
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,440
you know redder or redder or not

643
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,520
i guess tan i don't know

644
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,760
and so putting color film in it really

645
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
gave me this really weird

646
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,039
effect

647
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,320
don't be afraid to just go and

648
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,640
experiment with these if the film fits

649
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,559
try it on the camera it might come out

650
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,559
looking really weird it might be you

651
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,080
know a million dollar

652
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,840
iphone background love forever

653
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,960
here's actually the one that i got at

654
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,240
the swap meet

655
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,880
this is the brownie hawkeye 50s to the

656
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,240
60s

657
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,880
and odds are if you see you know goofy

658
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,159
picture of your grandparents from the

659
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,360
50s it was shot on one of these

660
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,039
this was this was truly an effort to

661
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,400
democratize

662
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,000
photography or at least

663
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,400
portraits and family things

664
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,200
with a mass market

665
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
sold everywhere

666
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,600
point and shoot you can't adjust the

667
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,159
shutter speed you can't adjust how wide

668
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,200
the lens is you have no choice about any

669
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,039
of this um

670
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,039
but that means they are virtually

671
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,120
indestructible because there's

672
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,520
just not a lot of moving parts on them

673
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,600
they're made out of bakelite it's a

674
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,760
thick piece of bakelite like you could

675
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,039
run run this thing over with a car

676
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,520
and totally cheap

677
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,840
i got i got the camera dude to give it

678
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,840
to me for five bucks

679
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,678
just totally cheap and really wonderful

680
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,120
i really enjoy them they all

681
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,159
end up taking photos similar to this

682
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,200
and

683
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,520
they're all kind of square photos

684
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,480
which is

685
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,720
which is really like it really gives it

686
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,440
that that antique feel to the photo

687
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,240
itself i was shooting in broad daylight

688
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
here on the left

689
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,760
actually in the shade

690
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,440
uh this one in the middle this is full

691
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,799
daylight uh i don't even know why

692
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,880
there's this splash of effect

693
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,559
um probably the sunlight coming in

694
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,159
somewhere probably mold

695
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,799
on the lens somewhere but totally

696
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,400
totally cool

697
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,039
um then this is me

698
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,360
who knows why i have like

699
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,919
great detail on my hair

700
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,919
but then all this stuff is foggy all

701
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,240
around don't know

702
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,799
but as these cameras age they they get

703
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,240
uh peculiar

704
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,559
in in very interesting ways and i think

705
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,279
it's a lot of fun

706
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,120
plus five bucks

707
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,480
move a little more modern here

708
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,039
and talk about the polaroid

709
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,919
this is the polaroid sx70

710
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,080
these are probably more of a familiar

711
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,960
style to you uh since um

712
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,200
it's uh slideshows and things geomorphic

713
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,880
interfaces like to show

714
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,919
polaroids as representing a photo

715
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,840
uh the sx70 is from the 70s and 80s

716
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,440
again another camera trying to

717
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,960
democratize

718
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,400
although i do appear to select

719
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,640
democratic cameras as well

720
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,480
they're they're way easier to work with

721
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,520
and they tend to hold up better

722
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,919
70s and 80s this one is collapsible

723
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,760
collapses down to about the same size as

724
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,640
the kodak pocket

725
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,440
so

726
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,799
pretty small

727
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,120
a little heft to it

728
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,720
but the fun thing about polaroids is

729
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,799
that they are instant

730
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,480
put that in quotes

731
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,000
they do take a few minutes to process

732
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,799
uh

733
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,520
and

734
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,120
they are seeing a modern resurgence

735
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,400
you've probably

736
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,799
you've probably at least seen a polaroid

737
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,279
camera in in a store somewhere

738
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,000
um it's it's a fascinating story to to

739
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
look up actually is that folks did

740
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,279
revive

741
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,559
the the brand uh and the film

742
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,559
and it is now actually possible to buy a

743
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,799
brand new polaroid

744
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,440
um but this one's antique i enjoy the

745
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,799
the antique

746
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,480
and i enjoy just how messed up it is

747
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,440
uh they are not cheap the film is not

748
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,399
cheap

749
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,960
uh especially when you consider that you

750
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,640
only get one shot at the photo you can't

751
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,440
take like 12 without using up the whole

752
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,120
whole pack of film it can be a little

753
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
expensive

754
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,799
and

755
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,080
one of the cool things though that i

756
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,600
would encourage you

757
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
if you're going to do some polaroids is

758
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,240
mess with mess with the photo while it's

759
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,080
developing

760
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,240
there are all sorts of people who who

761
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,720
just make whole whole forms of art by

762
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,799
taking a polaroid of something and then

763
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,880
taking a spoon and mashing the film

764
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,640
while it's developing

765
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,760
and it makes swirls and and it's it's

766
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,360
really a lot of fun

767
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,440
um there are other things you can do to

768
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,880
it as well

769
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,679
so

770
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,200
if you do get into polaroids that's

771
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,279
that's my encourage encouragement too

772
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,960
and here are the sorts of photos that i

773
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,200
got

774
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,840
and as you can see they're kind of kind

775
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,399
of blown out middle one's kind of blurry

776
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,600
it's at night

777
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,000
uh i think the camera collected light

778
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,399
for probably about five minutes

779
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,640
to get that shot

780
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,240
and then in broad daylight it doesn't

781
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,600
know what to do with the light it gets

782
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,279
completely sunburned

783
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,440
uh you end up with this but

784
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,399
but i

785
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,480
i love the uh i love the look that it

786
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,279
that it gives to things the uh

787
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,399
like you really do see a lot of

788
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,320
polaroids of people

789
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,399
having a good time laughing

790
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,279
um

791
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,799
and then i also like this one on the

792
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,080
right because it kind of feels like a

793
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,600
clint eastwood

794
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,200
thing

795
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
uh this actually was in boquillas i'm

796
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,039
sure they've they've filmed westerns

797
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,279
there

798
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,120
and then have fun um

799
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
there are some really cool old cameras

800
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,679
out there and because

801
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,559
because film photography is really being

802
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,679
abandoned

803
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,679
means you can get some really good deals

804
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,600
on stuff

805
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,320
the the film still exists

806
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,799
for for many of these cameras

807
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,600
um

808
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,120
and

809
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,440
you could just have so much fun this

810
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,600
this one upper middle here

811
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,000
this is a viewmaster camera

812
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,039
um

813
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,600
if you've ever seen a viewmaster it's

814
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,279
it's the 3d

815
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,200
where you you click it's the red

816
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,799
binocular looking things where you click

817
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,399
and you get a 3d image

818
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,960
this actually takes 3d photos that can

819
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,520
be used in a view master

820
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,520
really really fun camera um

821
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,360
there's little baby max

822
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,520
teeny little camera you feel like a spy

823
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,240
uh they don't make the film for this

824
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,360
anymore

825
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,279
uh so

826
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,600
if you're if you're okay hacking

827
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
which i am

828
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,440
get ready to hack on this one because

829
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,720
you will be

830
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,039
pulling apart a spool of film

831
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,960
in complete darkness taking scissors

832
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,120
trying to slice it

833
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,159
and then

834
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,919
roll it up and jam it into the camera

835
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,360
and close the camera in complete

836
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,640
darkness uh so that nothing is exposed

837
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,320
and then you'll have to

838
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,520
figure out what to do after that

839
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,159
then this guy over here on the right

840
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,080
this this beauty is a russian 3d camera

841
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,320
uh cold war technology

842
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,960
uh sputnik is what it what it says up

843
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,320
there

844
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,200
and

845
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,039
cold war cameras are really interesting

846
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,559
because

847
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,679
the us and the ussr

848
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,440
were

849
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,240
were really trying to show each other up

850
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,760
and so there's such interesting

851
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,360
technology happening

852
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,080
um you look at the viewmaster camera

853
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,240
this thing is is american technology it

854
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,760
wants to get noticed

855
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,840
uh for being pretty

856
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,120
the sputnik

857
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,440
does its job really well

858
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,320
and in a really intelligent way

859
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,559
so these two lenses in fact

860
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,000
if you take a look down here there's

861
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,960
this little crossbar

862
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,159
what's going on is as you focus

863
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,440
the crossbar

864
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,880
and this gear in the middle are making

865
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,720
sure that both

866
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,440
of the lenses have the same opening and

867
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,679
the same focus

868
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,919
and it just works the thing just works

869
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,000
it's beautiful it's also built like a

870
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,200
tank so you can drop a sputnik and not

871
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,519
worry if you drop a viewmaster you're

872
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,200
probably going to worry a little bit

873
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,360
it's pretty tough but

874
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,240
still

875
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,760
very interesting differences going on

876
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,919
there you can really see sort of a

877
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,840
anthropology

878
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,519
through through these antique cameras

879
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,519
here's how you can get started um

880
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,519
number one is go down to a flea market

881
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,320
five bucks um don't be afraid to bargain

882
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,120
um

883
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,039
you can get some piece of junk that

884
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,880
still works

885
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,600
and if you're just starting out a five

886
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,200
dollar brownie bakelite box with no

887
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,039
adjusting things

888
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,200
you tape it up with some gaffers tape

889
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,760
try it out and see if you like it and

890
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,159
you're not set back all that far

891
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,880
just a couple of bucks um

892
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
for film

893
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,200
these are the three sizes that are

894
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,960
easiest to work with

895
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,399
and most of the cameras out there are

896
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,799
going to use something like 120

897
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,640
the the old ones that i'm looking at are

898
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,480
127. you can find these at your your

899
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,840
usual photo

900
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,279
stores or online uh photo stores

901
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,200
they'll have these and then 35

902
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,720
millimeter um

903
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,840
which is really what the the end of the

904
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,399
1900s uh really a lot of cameras a lot

905
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,399
of consumer cameras were using 35

906
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,039
millimeter that stuff is out there

907
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,720
if you go and you buy like those

908
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,399
disposable cameras that's got 35

909
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,640
millimeter film in it

910
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,039
very very easy to find

911
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,440
of the three 35 millimeter is the

912
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,960
easiest to use

913
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,039
uh because it comes in a cartridge it's

914
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,399
self-contained

915
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,080
uh so

916
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,919
i encourage you

917
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,840
if you're if you're worried about

918
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,919
dealing with the film fumbling it and

919
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,760
keeping it away from light 35

920
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,480
millimeters so there you go

921
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,360
i found mine in a swap meet so flea

922
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,960
market swap mates totally way to go

923
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,320
they probably are going to think that

924
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,760
you're just a hipster buying it for your

925
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,960
zoom room

926
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,840
and

927
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,279
things don't work out with the camera

928
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,240
you can turn it into a hipster zoom

929
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,679
ebay ebay also has a lot of these

930
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,640
watch out for speculative bubbles

931
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,440
uh for instance my kodak vest pocket uh

932
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,039
it's one of my favorites

933
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,039
uh that i told you was like 20 bucks or

934
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,720
something um

935
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,320
it was

936
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,840
but then

937
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,640
ebay has this way of getting bubbles

938
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,440
where

939
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,199
the last time i checked to see what a

940
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,879
kodak best pocket was somebody wanted

941
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,040
250 or best offer

942
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,879
and i offered

943
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,199
like 200 and they basically told me i

944
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,800
was being a complete jerk um

945
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,079
you know the

946
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,040
market will pay or people speculate um

947
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,199
the thing was worth 20 bucks so there

948
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,000
will be cycles where you're you're

949
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,440
getting the brownie

950
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,918
the bakelite box of doom

951
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,719
real cheap one month and then you're

952
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,239
getting the best pocket real cheap the

953
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,079
next month

954
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,320
so watch out for those

955
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,560
do a little bit of research there uh you

956
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,760
will find these at estate sales

957
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,359
probably it's been sitting around in

958
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,159
somebody's attic uh problems

959
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,440
mold probably has a crack or two but uh

960
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,680
i mean who cares uh and some of these

961
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,640
you can practically throw in a

962
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,920
dishwasher

963
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,079
so check out estate sales if you're into

964
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,839
that kind of thing

965
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,280
or

966
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
better yet is not wait until there's an

967
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,119
estate sale

968
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,000
to go ask your relatives um grandparents

969
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,680
parents even

970
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,000
may just have these lying around

971
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,800
especially once you get the word out

972
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,079
there or once you've got one or two

973
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,640
already your relatives are going to find

974
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,000
out and they're going to be like oh yeah

975
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,079
we got this thing we had no idea what to

976
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,040
do with that

977
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,200
so you can get plenty of these for free

978
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,880
just by letting people know that you're

979
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,720
looking for them

980
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,640
they don't they don't want them but they

981
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,480
don't want to throw them out

982
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,640
so it's kind of fun for them to get get

983
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,240
a little extra life i don't know

984
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,680
as you go take notes

985
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,280
uh these

986
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,079
cameras are not an exact science

987
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,280
um

988
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,079
you

989
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,480
can have an app on your phone that tells

990
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,839
you exactly what

991
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,400
film speed and lens opening and exposure

992
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,839
time to use

993
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,000
which is really great if you've gone out

994
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,320
and purchased a really expensive slr or

995
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,680
something

996
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,599
not terribly useful if you've got the

997
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,599
kodak pocket camera

998
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,000
where your two choices are an exposure

999
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,560
time of a 25th of a second or a 50th of

1000
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,599
a second

1001
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,079
that's your choice that's all you got

1002
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,079
you can hold it open for a few seconds

1003
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,000
if you like but

1004
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,920
that's pretty much it

1005
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,359
aperture size how how wide open the the

1006
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,960
light opening is

1007
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
a lot of times you don't there's no

1008
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,880
number on there

1009
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,119
and so the apps are going to be really

1010
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,720
interesting

1011
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,760
and they'll give you a little bit of

1012
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,440
guidance

1013
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,760
but what you're going to want to do is

1014
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,040
take notes

1015
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,280
and just say hey for instance i've got

1016
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,520
this new kodak best pocket i've used 400

1017
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,720
speed film

1018
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,160
that'll be right on the

1019
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,200
film canister itself

1020
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,960
and then i'm just going to take really

1021
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,240
quick notes

1022
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,400
on what i was shooting so that when i

1023
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,119
get the film back from processing i can

1024
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,680
remind myself which frame it was

1025
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,160
what type of light it was

1026
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,119
um

1027
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,960
how my

1028
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,880
uh how wide my aperture was how much

1029
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,680
light i was letting in and then how long

1030
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,079
the shutter was open for

1031
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,440
these can be

1032
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,760
approximations because

1033
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,359
these old cameras they don't give you

1034
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,520
all these numbers to work with they're

1035
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,079
not a fancy slr so you're just going to

1036
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,480
have to write down something like hey

1037
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,040
the aperture was wide open it was in the

1038
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,680
daylight and i used the 25th

1039
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,079
um

1040
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,160
the other thing that i've that i found

1041
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,920
is is useful is even if you don't want

1042
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,359
to take notes

1043
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,520
you can at least pull out

1044
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,480
your

1045
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
your app on your phone

1046
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,400
and just screenshot it that's actually

1047
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,520
exactly what this is is a screenshot

1048
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,480
from when i was trying out a new camera

1049
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,800
and so all in here i can tell pretty

1050
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,240
much the same stuff

1051
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,040
um is the speed of my phone

1052
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,079
um roughly how wide the lens could have

1053
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,440
been

1054
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,839
what exposure was recommended and so at

1055
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,079
least it's kind of a proxy for

1056
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,160
this is how quickly i should have done

1057
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,560
this here's how much light

1058
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,480
the app was seeing

1059
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,680
so

1060
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,440
that uh if you don't want to take notes

1061
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,359
that's the way to kind of take notes is

1062
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,920
to say wow this exposure time was really

1063
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,200
really small that means it was really

1064
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,598
really bright that was a daylight shot

1065
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,560
and just had fun uh with both of these

1066
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,839
things rfid tags and antique cameras are

1067
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,640
just it's just a lot of fun it's it's a

1068
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,240
thing that you've only seen from the

1069
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,079
outside maybe

1070
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,200
you weren't sure if you could like

1071
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,560
actually get in there

1072
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,599
and try

1073
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,920
copying a key tag or

1074
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,720
or using that that camera that that you

1075
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,440
know

1076
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,880
grandpa had

1077
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,440
you really can uh it's it's pretty easy

1078
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,280
and you can go a pretty cheap route see

1079
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,720
if you like it

1080
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,560
or solve the problem at hand

1081
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,400
um and

1082
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,119
if you don't like it you know if you do

1083
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,680
now you got some more fun stuff to go so

1084
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,480
that's

1085
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,640
this actually is an anaglyph from uh

1086
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,119
combining a sputnik photo it takes two

1087
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,280
photos at a time and then there are apps

1088
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,839
out there that'll turn two photos into a

1089
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,839
uh red red blue

1090
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,280
3d image

1091
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,040
so that's what this guy is

1092
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,359
it's just saturn fine

1093
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,320
and that's my talk i'm gabe schuyler uh

1094
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,000
if you're on the hell site with blue

1095
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,800
bird gabe skye you can follow me uh i'll

1096
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,359
be in the slack on on this track on the

1097
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,800
track one uh answer questions happily

1098
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,160
or dma that's that's so comfortable

1099
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,599
hi gabe that was an awesome presentation

1100
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,680
um my question is which camera is your

1101
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,078
favorite

1102
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,240
oh that's a tricky one but it has to be

1103
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,640
oh man

1104
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,119
favorite favorite is the vest pocket

1105
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,520
because it's small that's collapsible

1106
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,960
and like you feel like some sort of old

1107
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,040
tiny person when you're like

1108
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,720
you're like oh i'm gonna take your

1109
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,400
picture you know to your friend and then

1110
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,319
you're like

1111
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,440
click

1112
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,400
so that's like what it is

1113
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,160
like you feel like you should have one

1114
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,640
of those flash bulbs and a cigar hanging

1115
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,839
out of your mouth

1116
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,800
and so for the little tiny mini

1117
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,480
how big

1118
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,040
was the film

1119
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,119
what i had to do was

1120
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,880
take a 35 millimeter uh film uh which is

1121
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,400
probably about as wide as like your air

1122
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,640
pod case

1123
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,079
and

1124
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,720
go into complete darkness

1125
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,599
and

1126
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,440
cut it in half

1127
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,359
down the the whole length

1128
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,680
but then just like kind of wound it up

1129
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,839
stuffed it in

1130
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:54,000
there and luckily the

1131
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,599
machines that they process this film on

1132
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,359
don't care how wide it is

1133
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,079
uh so they just it's the same process

1134
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,440
like clip it in

1135
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,160
feed it into the machine and that it

1136
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,920
actually worked that's super cool okay

1137
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,119
um let's see if we have other questions

1138
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,720
i really like

1139
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,000
i didn't know

1140
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,760
that you could i mean it makes sense but

1141
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,119
i didn't know that you could take like a

1142
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,240
spoon to a polaroid and and make things

1143
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,079
happen that's really neat

1144
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,400
yeah

1145
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,760
yeah you gotta try it if you've got a

1146
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,160
pole right

1147
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,920
and i don't know if you've experienced

1148
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,440
this but it seems as though like the

1149
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,599
older polaroids if you can get the

1150
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,160
the film that fits it's they seem to be

1151
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,920
work or they seem to work better than

1152
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,640
the new ones

1153
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,800
huh i haven't actually tried anyone in a

1154
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,960
while i just had the junky old one yeah

1155
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,200
which which is also fun in the same way

1156
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,480
as the best pocket because it's also

1157
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,160
collapsible so you're like hey you want

1158
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,920
to pull right of you and your friend's

1159
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,760
like yeah sure and you're like okay

1160
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,839
right

1161
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,480
click

1162
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,520
so clunky it's fine

1163
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,000
lots of comments about like the brownie

1164
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,240
and people you know being like that's my

1165
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
era of the yes

1166
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,319
the russian the russian camera was super

1167
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:15,200
cool

1168
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,599
oh i love that thing it's it's brilliant

1169
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,040
and it's similar to the

1170
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,280
um which now i understand is not true

1171
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,200
but it's similar to like the

1172
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,520
how people say like the us invented the

1173
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,880
space pen

1174
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,560
you know with like tons of engineering

1175
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,200
and the russians just used a pencil

1176
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,240
um which i think is now urban legend but

1177
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,599
still it's the same thing it's like we

1178
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,960
had the view master and it's like

1179
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,319
amazing engineering and they're like

1180
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,720
yeah but this works too

1181
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,880

1182
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,400
place that you

1183
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,920
would send your stuff to if somebody

1184
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,280
doesn't have like the setup to develop

1185
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,880
some of these things at home

1186
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,800
um

1187
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,200

1188
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,440
there are

1189
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,760
there are labs out there

1190
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,920
and actually if you if there is a

1191
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,839
photography shop

1192
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:02,800
in your

1193
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,880
in your city or whatever

1194
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,040
just go talk to them they can they will

1195
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,280
send it out to a lab that knows how to

1196
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,839
work with it

1197
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,920
okay um

1198
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,839
and then somebody else asked uh if the

1199
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,599
rfid is affected by interference at all

1200
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,760
um i haven't had trouble with it but

1201
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,000
it's uh it's so close

1202
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,560
the the reader and the tag are close

1203
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,640
enough and it's low-tech enough that i

1204
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,000
haven't really had trouble

1205
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,480
