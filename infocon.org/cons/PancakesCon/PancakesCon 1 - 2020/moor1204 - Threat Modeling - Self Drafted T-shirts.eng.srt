1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,400
and you will probably need to unmute

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,480
yourself

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,800
but i can see your desktop and your

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
webcam

5
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,840
are you able to hear me

6
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,479
all right it looks like we're having

7
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,320
some technical difficulties she'll give

8
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,839
us just a few moments

9
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,280
okay can everyone hear me sounds perfect

10
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,360
okay i'm working on the video portion

11
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,479
now so bear with me

12
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,040
technical problems always crop up it's

13
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,840
fine

14
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,119
i think it's because we have so many

15
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,119
interested folks which is fantastic

16
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,640
it's a good problem to have i completely

17
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,639
agree with you

18
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,560
okay so i'm gonna keep uh

19
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,800
waiting to see if this will pop up for

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,680
video

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,920
in the meantime i can introduce myself

22
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,640
really quickly

23
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,840
um so my name is moore 1204 other folks

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,040
call me mel

25
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,440
i'm an application security engineer at

26
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,160
a software startup in north carolina

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,000
um so really excited to talk a little

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,680
bit about threat modeling

29
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,239
which is a way to preemptively look

30
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,200
through

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,560
your software applications and design

32
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,800
to determine whether or not there are

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,400
potential security vulnerabilities

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,760
before they ever get to production so

35
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
it's a really great exercise

36
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,920
it doesn't look like i can actually show

37
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,840
my screen for some reason it's just

38
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,879
showing me a spinning wheel

39
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,440
so that's a little bit unfortunate um

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,900
but i can try to talk through

41
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,840
[Music]

42
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,360
um

43
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,720
oh great fabulous all right well i'm

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,640
going to present then i just can't see

45
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,720
that you can see it

46
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,920
so let me go ahead and present and we'll

47
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,399
get started can everyone see my slides

48
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,040
yep they're showing up just fine awesome

49
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,840
okay

50
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,519
all right so we're going to talk about

51
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,280
two things today threat modeling and

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,040
self-drafted t-shirts

53
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,040
um so you can see my tagline here is

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
model your threats and then model your

55
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,120
new t-shirt so we're really excited

56
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,519
let me go ahead and move through so

57
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,799
let's talk a little bit about what

58
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,720
threat modeling actually is

59
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,040
um and bear with me i just found a typo

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,560
so just uh

61
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
gloss over that but we'll talk about how

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,239
threat modeling

63
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,000
it sort of works to identify communicate

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,280
and understand

65
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,959
potential security vulnerabilities in

66
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,560
your software um

67
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,000
and this is a source from owasp that

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,599
gives this specific

69
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,760
definition or more of an academic

70
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,560
definition of what threat modeling is

71
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,720
but generally speaking it's just

72
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,560
documenting or diagramming

73
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,000
and hopefully mitigating potential

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
security vulnerabilities at the design

75
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,000
phase of your software development life

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,480
cycle and realistically you may use

77
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,680
threat modeling as well

78
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,798
to go through your legacy software but

79
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,478
the hope is that you'll catch these

80
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,000
types of things before they ever get to

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,240
production

82
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,000
so why might you want to threat model

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,080
well you can identify design

84
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,759
flaws in your software before they go to

85
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,360
production in theory

86
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,080
um you can help identify flaws in your

87
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,600
legacy software as we talked about

88
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,800
before

89
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,759
you can potentially train your teams to

90
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,680
think about security vulnerabilities as

91
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,280
a part of their design process so this

92
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,759
can be

93
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,040
operations it can be your future teams

94
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,400
it can be your sres it can be your

95
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,360
software

96
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,600
folks on the front and the back end and

97
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,040
it can also be your security team so

98
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,400
they can get more

99
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,120
skilled at finding potential security

100
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,479
vulnerabilities

101
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,520
as well and also it helps to improve the

102
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,680
design process as a whole over time so

103
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,560
folks will get

104
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,240
accustomed to doing threat modeling as a

105
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,520
part of their software design process

106
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,400
and hopefully become better and better

107
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,720
at

108
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,840
finding potential security

109
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,360
vulnerabilities before they become an

110
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,280
issue

111
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,639
so here's a little bit of a brief

112
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,720
history of threat modeling

113
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,639
obviously lots of these things are

114
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,639
relatively new in the grand scheme of uh

115
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,000
the history of the world

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,160
um but in the software world um threat

117
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,320
modeling is something that's been

118
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,840
utilized since the 1970s if not using

119
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,880
the term threat modeling specifically

120
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,400
so in the 70s christopher alexander used

121
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,639
the concept of threat modeling even

122
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,960
though it didn't have that term yet

123
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,720
to find potential threats in common

124
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,240
architectural patterns

125
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,960
um so there's lots of papers on um

126
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,080
there's one specific paper that

127
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,160
christopher alexander wrote but also

128
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,919
lots of papers as contemporaries of him

129
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,639
that are really interesting to read and

130
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,000
in the 1980s

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,400
uh robert barnard introduced the concept

132
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,080
of attacker profiles

133
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,639
um so that was uh another uh iteration

134
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,160
on the things that christopher alexander

135
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,240
had done in the past

136
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,840
and then in the 1990s things really

137
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,120
started to take off with the advent of

138
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,080
regular use of the open internet so

139
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,360
edward omarosa

140
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,039
introduced the concept of threat trees

141
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,880
which i'm sure some of you have

142
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
become accustomed to are familiar with

143
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,080
and then our

144
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,440
very famous bruce schneier

145
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,199
introduced the concept of visualizing

146
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,919
attack trees with nodes and leafs

147
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,080
and he has a lot of really great papers

148
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,680
and blog about

149
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,520
threat modeling and really interesting

150
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,280
if you're interested in getting more

151
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,880
information about that and then uh

152
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,360
microsoft introduced the thrive strap

153
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,639
model or the strides

154
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,000
threat model that we'll talk about in a

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,479
few minutes and microsoft is kind of

156
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,759
known

157
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,240
for i guess operationalizing this a

158
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,000
little bit more than other folks so

159
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,440
we'll talk a little bit about that

160
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,280
threat model process

161
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,318
in the next couple of slides

162
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,800
so there's more than one diff type of

163
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,560
threat modeling framework

164
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,360
i've listed four here i am most familiar

165
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,479
with stride so that's the one we're

166
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,360
going to talk about

167
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,720
um but fast seems like one that might be

168
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,080
really interesting to explore in the

169
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,199
next couple years

170
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,039
um in particular because we're looking

171
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,759
at um threat modeling not just for

172
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,280
our software and our infrastructure but

173
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,680
also

174
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,240
across the entire sdlc are there places

175
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,440
where we're

176
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,360
maybe in our ci cd pipeline that we

177
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,440
haven't considered

178
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,319
could potentially be problematic and so

179
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,000
i'm actually keeping an eye out on the

180
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,599
vast threat model

181
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,759
for the future but currently we're using

182
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,879
strides so we're going to talk about

183
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,240
that

184
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,280
so what is stride it's an acronym that

185
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,720
stands for

186
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,759
spoofing tampering repudiation

187
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,840
information disclosure denial of service

188
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,759
or escalation of privileges so

189
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,879
we're looking at five

190
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,440
or six different areas that we want to

191
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,120
focus on

192
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,080
threat modeling in particular and so

193
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,360
i'll talk a little bit about what

194
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,160
spoofing is

195
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,319
it's basically pretending to be someone

196
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,479
you're not tampering is

197
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,160
tampering with data it can be tampering

198
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,000
with network packets it can be tampering

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,840
with

200
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
um login pages for example

201
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,800
and repudiation is not being able to

202
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,399
prove someone has or has not done

203
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,039
something

204
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,599
and that really centers around logging

205
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,120
and monitoring

206
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,839
there's information disclosure which is

207
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,200
basically providing a

208
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,440
authorized user with information that

209
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,560
they shouldn't have

210
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,120
or shouldn't have access to denial of

211
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,720
service is pretty straightforward it's

212
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,200
you know obviously not being able to

213
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,000
access a resource

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
so you should be able to because either

215
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,920
you're overloading the network or

216
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,320
overloading your resources and then

217
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,080
escalation of privileges

218
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,440
is pretty uh pretty scary type of thing

219
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,080
where

220
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,320
you shouldn't have access to something

221
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,240
and you're able to give yourself a

222
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
accelerated access to a resource or a

223
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,600
series of resources that you shouldn't

224
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
have access to

225
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,680
so here's a very very simple um

226
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,279
network or diagram that we're going to

227
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,720
use to go through an

228
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,839
actual stride threat model um this is

229
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,640
obviously a over well overly simplified

230
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,680
um

231
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
service that we've outlined and this

232
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,080
comes from the threat modeling book

233
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,959
that adam shostak wrote in 2014 it's an

234
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,040
excellent resource if you're interested

235
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,560
um if you're interested in um

236
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,080
actually getting really really deep into

237
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,000
the stride threat model in particular

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,720
um lots of interesting resources with

239
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,200
regards to brainstorming uh

240
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,959
ways that you can threat model there's

241
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,640
all different types of

242
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,279
really great templates as well so um

243
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,080
this is

244
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,399
this comes from that book very very

245
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,040
simple i've probably never seen

246
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,480
a production service it's quite this

247
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
simplistic but for the

248
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,920
um so we can utilize the um

249
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,760
the time that we have we'll just pretend

250
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,440
that this is a thing that

251
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,240
folks could actually have in production

252
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,839
so when you think about threat modeling

253
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,279
you think about what could potentially

254
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,399
go wrong

255
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,839
um so uh here is a list of questions

256
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,200
that we've come across

257
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,519
um when we look at that in engineering

258
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,320
diagram or that data flow diagram

259
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,720
to determine what we need to think about

260
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,440
when we

261
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,800
redesign our software so spoofing

262
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,279
is thinking about is it possible for

263
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,800
someone to pretend

264
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,959
to be someone they're not to gain access

265
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,760
to our web server or a data center

266
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
is it possible from a tapering

267
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,800
perspective

268
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
for someone to be able to edit the data

269
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,560
in our database when they shouldn't be

270
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,839
able to

271
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,200
um repudiation is can an

272
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,360
authorized user maybe brute force login

273
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,040
page and we aren't doing anything with

274
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,640
regards to logging to make sure that we

275
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:02,959
know

276
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,120
that's happening um can a user

277
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,959
request information from a search query

278
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,120
that they shouldn't um be able to do or

279
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,640
maybe they get more results than they

280
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,440
should

281
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,440
have access to um or do we have for

282
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,200
with regards to the denial service do we

283
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,560
have um

284
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,880
limitations or throttling on api

285
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,160
resources which

286
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,680
isn't shown in this particular diagram

287
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,079
something to think about um

288
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,680
do we limit the number of times a user

289
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,120
can request a login page

290
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,000
incorrectly those types of things and

291
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,680
then elevation of privileges

292
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,120
is can our customer access our database

293
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,880
directly from the open internet that's a

294
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,519
pretty

295
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,920
bad thing to do um do we prevent them

296
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,440
from doing something like that

297
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,959
um so these are the types of questions

298
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,399
that you go through when you talk about

299
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,440
threat modeling

300
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,680
um and it's really a um kind of an

301
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,399
uh an alternative to um a really

302
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,160
positive attitude that most developers

303
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,600
have which is that

304
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,519
okay we got this thing to do the one

305
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,639
thing that we want it to do

306
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,360
this is a way to say well how are how

307
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,959
are all the places that we want this

308
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:07,680
thing to do

309
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,720
the thing that we want to do like a

310
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,040
login page um are there ways to break it

311
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,399
are there things that we aren't thinking

312
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,760
about that we need to

313
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,200
um include into our design process um

314
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,480
that we wouldn't necessarily think about

315
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,600
because really we're most concerned

316
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
about making sure it works

317
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,920
so threat modeling is a great resource

318
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,519
to kind of turn that on its head and

319
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,000
think about

320
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
how we could design our software better

321
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,680
so here is a workflow to go through the

322
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,720
stride threat model in particular

323
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,839
typically you'd want to start with an

324
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,600
engineering diagram or data flow diagram

325
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,519
like we saw before

326
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,760
almost all of our production software is

327
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,519
going to be way more complex than that

328
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,760
but you can start with components of

329
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
that instead so you break it down into

330
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,079
pieces so you can think about

331
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,279
maybe you only are focused on the api

332
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,040
endpoints for a particular service or

333
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,519
microservice that you've put in place

334
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,320
so you don't have to do the entire sdlc

335
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,800
in one

336
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,360
go that actually i would not advise uh

337
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,839
on that

338
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,880
so um you know start small with the data

339
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,279
flow

340
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,360
diagram of something that you want to

341
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,200
threat model

342
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,519
and then along that trust boundary which

343
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,480
are um

344
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,160
you know we saw that trust boundary was

345
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
the dotted line um on the little

346
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,079
services so the data center had its own

347
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,839
um trust boundary in the database it's

348
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,320
not

349
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,200
open to the internet had its own um

350
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,800
dotted diagrams so

351
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,880
um you think about along that truss

352
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,079
boundary um

353
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,839
are there places um that

354
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,680
we need to be concerned about um and we

355
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,600
can go through the stride model and say

356
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,480
um are there places where we this could

357
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,399
potentially be spoofed are there places

358
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:50,880
where

359
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,839
um we're introducing the opportunity to

360
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,600
be vulnerable to denial of service for

361
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,360
example

362
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,720
and then write out specifically how the

363
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,639
vulnerability could occur

364
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,880
and call out those susceptible systems

365
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,040
that you've outlined

366
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,880
and then for those out outlined

367
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,560
vulnerabilities you're going to want to

368
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,279
write security tickets jira tickets

369
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,040
whatever it is that you use to track

370
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,320
this type of

371
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,399
type of work and include it in the

372
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,160
design for the feature

373
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,360
and the my my recommendation is to

374
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,160
ensure

375
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,560
that your um your feature teams are

376
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,880
actually incorporating that as

377
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,760
acceptance criteria uh for actually

378
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,320
shipping that feature

379
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,160
and and ensure that those tickets are

380
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,519
being addressed by your development

381
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,160
teams

382
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,240
often that they may decide this is not

383
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,279
part of the

384
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,000
um you know the ga of that particular

385
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,720
feature and

386
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,760
it's important to reiterate how

387
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,839
we want to ensure that these things

388
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:48,800
these security

389
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,279
vulnerabilities are addressed before we

390
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,199
actually um submit this and put it into

391
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,000
production for

392
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,360
for users to utilize and then another

393
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,639
thing that's really important to think

394
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,279
about is

395
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,839
incorporating regression testing into

396
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,440
the now fixed vulnerabilities

397
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,720
and the reason that you want to do that

398
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,519
is to make sure um in new features that

399
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,639
you're not actually

400
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,160
going backwards and reintroducing these

401
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
security vulnerabilities in a future

402
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
release

403
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,760
and finally hopefully you'll sleep a

404
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,199
little bit better knowing that these

405
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,880
specific vulnerabilities didn't make it

406
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,600
into production

407
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,320
so here are three tool free tools you

408
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,079
can use there are obviously paid tools

409
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,839
that you can utilize as well

410
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,839
um so there's the microsoft threat

411
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,279
modeling tool that's based on this

412
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,880
threat stride that model that we talked

413
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
about today

414
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,600
um it is windows only so that's a little

415
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
bit of a disadvantage for those

416
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,959
linux and mac users but there's also

417
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,759
the um a new tool that owasp just

418
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,839
released as a 1.0 uh

419
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,959
called threat dragon it is

420
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,839
um a tool that you can download mac or

421
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,560
linux

422
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,079
i assume it probably works in windows

423
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,680
but i haven't tried it

424
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,959
um but it's a really interesting kind of

425
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,440
flow diagram that you can utilize and

426
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,639
you can actually pull that down as a

427
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,000
json object and include

428
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
it in your release so you can reuse it

429
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,759
and re

430
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,000
and add new things to it in the future

431
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,800
as your

432
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,320
software features change and then

433
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,880
you can also just kind of go really low

434
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,800
key and do a lucidchart plus

435
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,759
webform template and incorporate that as

436
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,519
reports and we've done that in the past

437
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,880
uh where i work so

438
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,320
it seems to be working pretty well

439
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,560
obviously automation be fantastic but

440
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,880
this is a great start

441
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,560
so that's sort of where we're at with

442
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,639
regards to threat modeling

443
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,880
um i'm gonna go ahead and start talking

444
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
a little bit about self-drafted t-shirts

445
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,639
if everybody's ready to go to the next

446
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,959
slide

447
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,000
okay so self-drafted t-shirts are

448
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
actually pretty easy to create

449
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
um if you just have a little bit of

450
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,920
patience and um

451
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,240
um kind of work through some of the

452
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,839
challenges of learning how to sew

453
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,120
if you don't already know how to sew

454
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,439
this is a great place to start

455
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,720
because it's pretty straightforward

456
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,799
you're really only sewing a few lines so

457
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,400
nothing too complicated and you're

458
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,760
starting with a template that you know

459
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,319
already works

460
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,720
so one of the things that i always find

461
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,400
really challenging is finding

462
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,720
really great fitting t-shirts and for

463
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,319
those of us that are um

464
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,079
kind of female presenting in the uh

465
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,679
infosec world we know that a lot of

466
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,760
times we go to conferences and

467
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,760
um the t-shirts are just not quite the

468
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,880
right fit

469
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,320
so i uh decided to learn how to create

470
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,840
my own t-shirts um or really modify the

471
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,200
t-shirts that i do get from some of

472
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,640
these conference talks so that they will

473
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,480
actually fit me in a way that i

474
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,240
prefer so i showed you an example of my

475
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,919
favorite t-shirt this is not my actual

476
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,039
favorite t-shirt but

477
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,960
my favorite t-shirt is a rolling stones

478
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,559
t-shirt um so just

479
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,840
uh just suspend your disbelief on that

480
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,799
um and it's honestly really hard to find

481
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,000
the right t-shirt fit even

482
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,280
if you're not talking about infrastruct

483
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,520
conference t-shirts so i always try to

484
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,160
modify and tailor my clothes when i can

485
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,360
i'm so i'm going to show you how to do

486
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,000
that so there's a couple of ways that

487
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,799
you can

488
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,600
draft a new your new favorite t-shirt

489
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,720
you can

490
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,520
start with your favorite t-shirt so i've

491
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
shown you one here it's just the inside

492
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,960
out of a t-shirt that i have i don't

493
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,160
know if you can see my

494
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,280
myself here um but if you can um so this

495
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,360
is inside out and i'll show you kind of

496
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,640
when we talk about how to

497
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,919
assemble this um how you can

498
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,960
sew these seams together so what you'll

499
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,600
do

500
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,720
is we're going to either remove the

501
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,240
seams here

502
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,080
basically disassembling my favorite

503
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,520
t-shirt or

504
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,640
you can trace around the t-shirt with

505
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,960
um some tissue paper and it's a lot

506
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
harder to do because you can see

507
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,440
um i don't know if you can see my screen

508
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,160
here but

509
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,480
um you have this um kind of crew neck

510
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,320
here and that's a little bit hard if

511
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
uh you haven't done it before to

512
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,840
replicate um

513
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,679
but we'll talk about um how we might go

514
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,919
about doing that in just a few minutes

515
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,320
um so i'm going to show you how you can

516
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,000
do both of these things they're pretty

517
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,080
straightforward um but um

518
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,400
we'll go through it now um so here's a

519
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,440
list of the things that you're gonna

520
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
need to make this happen

521
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
um you're gonna need your favorite

522
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,200
t-shirt which i have here

523
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,400
um i would purchase a jersey knit fabric

524
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,080
from either the fabric store for those

525
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,679
of us who are not um

526
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,400
shelter in place just yet or an online

527
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,840
store so you can probably find it from

528
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
amazon or joann's or

529
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,559
any number of really great online fabric

530
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,520
stores

531
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,000
or you can do what i mentioned before

532
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,640
with my info

533
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,600
t-shirts and do a t-shirt that's too big

534
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,039
and then you just trace along that and

535
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:47,760
actually

536
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,919
pull in the seams you're going to need a

537
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,679
pair of sharp scissors

538
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,240
so that you can cut your thread and or

539
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,720
the seams on your t-shirt

540
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,080
you're going to need some tissue paper

541
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,880
for tracing some straight pins or safety

542
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,159
pens

543
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,320
some needle and thread that matches the

544
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,760
color of your t-shirts in this case i

545
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,280
have a gray t-shirt so i need to get

546
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,039
some gray thread that matches as closely

547
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,080
as possible

548
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,159
or really sorry to interrupt but could

549
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,760
we possibly try to get the webcam

550
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,559
working

551
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,400
oh is it not showing uh it's still

552
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,919
spinning i can't seem to

553
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,880
i'm gonna click it one more time because

554
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,320
it we were

555
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,080
thinking that we probably should have

556
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,360
been seeing something the way you were

557
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,240
talking

558
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,559
yeah and it's uh it basically is just

559
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,200
the spinning wheel i can't seem to um

560
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,679
to show my webcam i'm not sure why

561
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,360
um we gave it a shot

562
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,400
yeah sorry about that um but i will talk

563
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,600
as if you can't see me instead

564
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,320
uh okay so you can't see my gray t-shirt

565
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,440
but i have a great t-shirt in front of

566
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,120
me um in front of my face that you can't

567
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,679
see

568
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,840
um so apologies for that um but thank

569
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,039
you for bringing it up that you can't

570
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:57,919
see

571
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,039
um so what you're gonna wanna do um you

572
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,039
have the option also

573
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,799
i did talk about kneading needle and

574
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,960
thread and a permanent marker so that

575
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,400
you can trace

576
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,120
around the perimeter of the pieces or

577
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,000
the whole t-shirt

578
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,039
we also uh optionally can do a seam

579
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,559
ripper which is a little bit easier than

580
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,320
using a pair of scissors to cut the

581
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,440
seams

582
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,720
um or you can also use a sewing machine

583
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,080
or serger if you have something

584
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,840
of that um and that will make it a

585
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,120
little bit easier as well

586
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,559
but we're going to assume that you

587
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,039
probably are not going to go out and buy

588
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,000
a sewing machine or serger if you don't

589
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,360
already have it

590
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,880
you can do this by hand as well just

591
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,679
takes a bit longer

592
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,799
all right so if you choose option two

593
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,480
which is to um

594
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,240
um use the pieces of your uh t-shirt

595
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,360
um you're going to um if you have a

596
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,640
t-shirt in front of you this might be

597
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
easier to visualize but

598
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,960
if you turn your t-shirt inside out

599
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,799
there are a number of seams that you'll

600
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,440
see

601
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,480
and it's just held together by thread

602
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,240
so you'll just rip out those seams

603
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,919
very carefully with a pair of scissors

604
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,520
or seam ripper

605
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,039
and if you have a commercial t-shirt it

606
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,840
will have serger seams

607
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,799
so it looks like it's looping over the

608
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,520
fringe of the seam itself

609
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,720
so you'll want to very carefully take

610
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,520
the

611
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,000
edge of your scissors and slide it

612
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,919
underneath the thread and just cut it

613
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,760
through

614
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,679
and just be super careful because you

615
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,960
can cut the

616
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,480
fabric itself and then you'll end up a

617
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,000
hole in your

618
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,679
with a hole in your new favorite t-shirt

619
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,760
um which in if you or your old paper

620
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,840
t-shirt which you may not want to do

621
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,760
um if you ever want to reassemble it and

622
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,960
um still wear your

623
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,360
old favorite t-shirt um okay so

624
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,640
you'll um remove those seams

625
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,360
uh remove the seams and then um start

626
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,640
with the sleeves

627
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,679
the side seams and then the sleeves

628
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,520
and then put the two sleeves aside when

629
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,960
you're done um

630
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,480
and then you're going to cut the

631
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,559
shoulder seams which is going to be

632
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,880
from the collar to where the sleeves

633
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,360
were located

634
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,280
and then when you're done you should

635
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,360
have four pieces so you have the two

636
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,039
sleeves the one front piece with the

637
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,159
scoop in the

638
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,000
front and then the back piece which

639
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,280
should have a tag attached

640
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,960
okay so the next step is to trace this

641
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,760
shirt

642
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,080
um so you want to find some tissue paper

643
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
or newspaper if you want if you don't

644
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,600
have tissue paper

645
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,640
and you're basically just going to line

646
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,120
out

647
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,000
the pieces of the t-shirt onto the

648
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,880
tissue paper

649
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,200
and you're going to find your permanent

650
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,080
marker

651
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,600
and lay out your t-shirt onto the um

652
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,799
the paper and then essentially trace it

653
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,720
you can use uh straight pins or safety

654
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,320
pins to pin it to the tissue to make it

655
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,360
a little easier

656
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,640
um that's essentially what you're going

657
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,559
to do and then you're going to cut out

658
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,760
the fabric plus the tissue paper pieces

659
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,620
and then you're going to

660
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,720
[Music]

661
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,240
take the you're going to take the tissue

662
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,159
paper pieces and separate it from the

663
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,679
old t-shirt pieces

664
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,600
and put it on top of the new fabric that

665
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,880
you bought and then you're just going to

666
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,279
pin

667
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,559
those tissue paper pieces to the

668
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,760
fabric and you're going to do the same

669
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,679
thing where you outline the perimeter of

670
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,720
that and then cut it out

671
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,039
and then the next step is to assemble

672
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,480
the t-shirt

673
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,840
and i'm just making sure i'm good on

674
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,919
time um so

675
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,720
you're going to take um the shoulder

676
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,000
seams first

677
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,039
and line them up um inside out

678
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,600
basically so the the piece the part of

679
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,120
the fabric that you want to be on the

680
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,039
outside when you actually wear it

681
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,960
um you're going to put those uh two

682
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,240
sides together

683
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,200
and um pin the shoulder seams together

684
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,000
and then sew

685
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,279
right across from one end to the other

686
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,320
and you're gonna do the same thing for

687
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,840
the other side of the shoulder seam so

688
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,200
there should be two shoulder seam

689
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
shoulder seams and you're gonna sew them

690
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,400
both um

691
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,159
separately inside out and then the next

692
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,039
thing you're gonna do

693
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,799
is pin the sleeves to the armholes

694
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,600
and so you'll want to make sure that the

695
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,400
shortest

696
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,760
part of the shoulder or the sleeve

697
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,720
itself

698
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,400
is going to go to the bottom that's

699
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,600
going to be the bottom part of the

700
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,520
sleeve

701
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,679
and then you're going to sew that around

702
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,720
the perimeter of the sleeve hole that um

703
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,640
from the shoulder seam down to where the

704
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,559
side seams will be sewn

705
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,520
you're going to do that for both both

706
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,640
sleeves

707
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,520
and then um after you're done with that

708
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,679
you'll pin the side seams together

709
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,520
and you'll start from the bottom so that

710
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,200
if you do

711
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,240
make a mistake and don't line the um the

712
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,919
sleeves together just right then you'll

713
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:56,720
be able to

714
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,240
accommodate for that and kind of pinch

715
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,400
it into the um

716
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,080
into the the hole here where the

717
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,879
armpit should be

718
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,039
and so that's pretty much all you're

719
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,279
going to need to do to get a really

720
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,320
basic outline

721
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,919
of a new favorite t-shirt that you know

722
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,919
will fit just right

723
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,600
there's optional finishing that you can

724
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,400
do i would definitely consider

725
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,240
especially depending on the type of knit

726
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
that you get

727
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,760
creating a hem at the bottom of the

728
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,559
t-shirt so that you'll just fold it over

729
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,440
and then sew along the bottom there you

730
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,880
can also

731
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,279
hem the sleeves and there's a lot of

732
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,799
different tutorials on how to do that

733
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,880
you can also do really fancy

734
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,799
hems if you wanted and this might be a

735
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,919
good place to do

736
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,440
contrast stitching which is basically

737
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,960
choosing a color that's completely

738
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,279
opposite of the t-shirt itself

739
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,880
just to make give it a little pizzazz

740
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,200
and you can also order a knit collar i

741
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,720
would not recommend making one yourself

742
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,400
unless you're an advanced sewist

743
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
um it's actually pretty difficult to do

744
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,520
in my opinion but maybe

745
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,799
other folks are a little more talented

746
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,520
than myself um and you'll just use that

747
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
um to get that kind of ribbed collar at

748
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,720
the top

749
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,919
um and then you or you can use bias tape

750
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,360
which those of you who know what bisap

751
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,600
is it's a really fantastic thing to do

752
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,799
and the other thing i didn't mention

753
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,039
that you can do is

754
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,720
include a little pocket if you wanted so

755
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,399
i have the t-shirt that i have right

756
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,760
here which you can't see unfortunately

757
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,240
has

758
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,480
a floral pocket that i put on the front

759
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,799
here um so that's really a nice little

760
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,000
um

761
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,120
contrast to the gray t-shirt um

762
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,679
so that's pretty much all i have does

763
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,679
anybody have any questions

764
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,039
not sure if i can see them or not let me

765
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,520
see i did see one question that rose to

766
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,279
the top that was not about the webcam

767
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,960
and it's uh do you think that it'd be

768
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,720
smart to develop a tool similar to

769
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,840
stride or threat dragon

770
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,520
i don't see why not absolutely

771
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,200
especially if it's um you know

772
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,159
non-microsoft friendly absolutely i

773
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,120
think that'd be really great

774
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,279
which industry tool do you think works

775
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,520
the best

776
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,480
uh so as far as um that's a good

777
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,000
question and we actually only use open

778
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,640
source so

779
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,159
i don't know that i can answer that

780
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,760
intelligently but i know that there are

781
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,360
lots and lots of tools out there

782
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,919
that range in price that other folks

783
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,360
could probably pipe in and

784
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,640
provide some guidance on all right and

785
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,960
somebody was asking if you use fortify

786
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,880
we don't but i know that other folks in

787
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,559
the industry have used it

788
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,000
okay i'm switching those topics i guess

789
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
when making your own t are you removing

790
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,640
the color from the equation

791
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,320
uh yes so that's the stuff that i didn't

792
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,919
include here but

793
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,760
some t-shirts do have that collar and

794
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,200
you would definitely want to remove the

795
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,080
collar

796
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,480
um and then if you're able to get um for

797
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,600
your new t-shirt

798
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,919
um a collar that you can order online

799
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,520
you can usually get them from

800
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,360
um kind of nice they're they're

801
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
considered notions so if you go to like

802
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
a an online fabric store and try to

803
00:28:59,279 --> 00:28:59,919
order one

804
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,360
you should be able to find them or

805
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,960
amazon also um

806
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,799
but you'll want to if you do want to

807
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,000
have that color you'll definitely want

808
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,399
to

809
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,640
include that in your new t-shirt but yes

810
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,760
that is something that you'll

811
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,760
want to remove unless you want to

812
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,919
not include a collar and that way you'll

813
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,279
just have that extra

814
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,640
inch and a half or so of give at the top

815
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,679
for your new t-shirt

816
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,760
all right let's see if we have anymore

817
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,039
and it doesn't like

818
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,600
look like we do so thank you so very

819
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,240
much for this talk that's fascinating

820
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,919
i didn't even think that you would need

821
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,720
to take a t-shirt apart to be able to do

822
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,159
that but it makes sense because i feel

823
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,679
you on that t-shirt fit thing from

824
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,480
conferences

825
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,080
oh yeah awesome
