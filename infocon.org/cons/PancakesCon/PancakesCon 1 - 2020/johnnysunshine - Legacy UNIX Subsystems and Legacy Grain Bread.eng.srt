i also want to announce we are switching

17
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,120
over moderators

18
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,440
and we have the leveling union who will

19
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,599
be continuing moderating

20
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,040
uh for the rest of this afternoon so uh

and we also have today johnny fuzz guy

25
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,959
who is going to be presenting

26
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,879
his uh talk with uh

27
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,799
legacy unix subsystems and legacy green

28
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,760
bread so this is for most of the

29
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,239
computer history there has been unix

30
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,239
along the way we've cultivated many

31
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,280
legacy systems that still exist today

32
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,200
often some hidden corner of the unix

33
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,319
file system

34
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,120
still usable but rarely used mostly

35
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,200
having been replaced with modern

36
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,840
messes for most of human history there

37
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,239
has

38
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,159
been bread along with the way we've

39
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,400
cultivated many legacy grains that still

40
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,159
exist today often some

41
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,840
hidden corner of the world still

42
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,680
unusable but really used

43
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,280
mostly having them replaced with more

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,159
modern grades in this talk johnny will

45
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,080
briefly go over some of the weird bits

46
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,560
and spots flying around in your unix

47
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,080
that may have never been

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,480
used or in some greens lying around the

49
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,400
world that they have never been used

50
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,680
and show you how to use them so off to

51
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,238
you johnny

52
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,680
hello hi everyone uh welcome to my

53
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,880
talk um

54
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,479
if it sounds like it's slapped together

55
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,479
in four days that would be because it is

56
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,560
slapped together in four days in fact

57
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,040
um so i want to talk to you a little bit

58
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,320
about

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,000
some old stuff because i like it um

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,040
old computers old grains uh

61
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,080
i didn't study history but i kind of

62
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,199
am a bit of a history nerd

63
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,840
so who do i even think i am um i'm gonna

64
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,360
start with the computer part

65
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,400
um so i didn't

66
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,479
uh i grew up um pulling computer parts

67
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,039
out of the trash putting them together

68
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:01,840
um

69
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,320
i had a 8088 well into the 386 era and a

70
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,840
486 well into the pentium 2 era

71
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,600
so i've always kind of had old computers

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,120
kicking around

73
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,639
um i was sort of adjacent to the hackers

74
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,840
scene it was terrible so

75
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,720
people people were jerks you could never

76
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,199
really be

77
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,639
lead enough um so

78
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,639
i kind of slipped into just being a

79
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,000
programmer

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,680
being somebody who really liked old

81
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
computers i also really liked the large

82
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,600
computers so some of the history of

83
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,280
of um the way that we have

84
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,000
created uh machines over time um

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,720
i don't know i just like really liked

86
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,919
big machines

87
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,960
um so

88
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,680
i was a programmer i studied comparative

89
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,720
philosophy

90
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,919
uh through college um somewhere along

91
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,160
the line i took a formal logic class i

92
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
enjoyed it quite a bit

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,160
uh it was cross-listed with computer

94
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,360
science so i

95
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,400
sources um eventually got my degree in

96
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,840
that but i still have a minor

97
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,720
in uh in comparative philosophy with

98
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,840
kind of a

99
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,719
focus on like the history of ideas

100
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,319
so during college being somebody who

101
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,199
really liked

102
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,600
large machines um sun microsystems

103
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,880
open sourced solaris uh while i was in

104
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,440
about my

105
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,319
third year of college um and this was

106
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,319
great to me because

107
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,080
this was a this was a real operating

108
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,600
system that were on real machines i

109
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
didn't have to play with linux anymore

110
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,639
and i i don't i don't mean to um

111
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,560
to denigrate linux at all on this uh it

112
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,720
was just like at the time it was

113
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,080
it was a from the famous like

114
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,919
post from from line of storyboards

115
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,199
introducing it it was

116
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,759
not as real as you know real unix so

117
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,199
this was like a real unix i got

118
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,800
that i got to play with so i started

119
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
playing with it eventually got a job at

120
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,720
sun microsystems in their operating

121
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
systems engineering group

122
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,599
um and kind of went from there

123
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,199
um sun doesn't exist anymore uh but

124
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,880
while i was there i picked up a lot of

125
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
stories about

126
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,199
how things you know were put together

127
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,720
some of the history of why they were put

128
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,759
together

129
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,160
um so hopefully i can share something

130
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,400
useful with you guys

131
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,759
you people sorry um so let's start with

132
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,199
the beginning of unix uh unix started in

133
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,960
18t bell labs

134
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,000
um it started

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,160
because uh kernighan

136
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,800
wanted to play video games um that's not

137
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,080
even a joke so

138
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,400
the the machines that they use mostly uh

139
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,360
were very large

140
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,440
very expensive batch processing machines

141
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,720
that cost something on the order of

142
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,520
hundreds of dollars

143
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,560
an hour to to use but

144
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,560
bell labs had an old pdp-8 kicking

145
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,759
around which was this

146
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,479
um this tiny machine it was about the

147
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,000
size of a refrigerator

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,360
um that was you know

149
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,680
just open for grabs and carnigan wanted

150
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,360
to play a lunar lander game

151
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,479
um you know it was the late 60s early

152
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,120
70s

153
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
um with people that just landed on the

154
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,479
moon

155
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,759
um and so you know there was a few video

156
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,360
game simulations kicking around for

157
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,440
machines that you could

158
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,919
plot your own course and you know land

159
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,440
on the virtual moon

160
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,159
um having this machine kicking around

161
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,519
kernighan decided you know what i'm just

162
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,559
going to write my own

163
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,760
we can have some fun it'll be great um

164
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,919
so like all good projects he invented a

165
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,279
programming language and an operating

166
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,560
system to go with it

167
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,240
um and that operating system

168
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,160
was unix which was a play on the name

169
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,920
from multix which was a multi-user

170
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
operating system

171
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,040
uh this was unix because they were

172
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,880
clever like that i guess um

173
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
the the interesting part about writing

174
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,720
writing unix though is that he decided

175
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,519
to write it in

176
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,600
in a high-level language uh which was

177
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,040
one that he created himself he didn't

178
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,560
write it in cobalt or anything

179
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,680
but that language was c the c

180
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,279
programming language

181
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,440
um and so he wrote

182
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,279
most of the operating system in c with

183
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,720
some subroutines

184
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,680
in the uh in the upgrades or the

185
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,600
assembly code for the pdp-8

186
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
um that machine kind of outlived its

187
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,680
usefulness fairly early on

188
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,600
um so it almost immediately got ported

189
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,360
to the pdp 11 which was the

190
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,720
successor to the eight um where it kind

191
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
of lived on and the pdp 11 became

192
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,920
very very popular uh on

193
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,680
university campuses because it was you

194
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,959
know relatively speaking

195
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,480
incredibly cheap um so it

196
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,720
sort of ended up spreading from there so

197
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,560
uh kernighan's board he's playing video

198
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,800
games he writes this operating system

199
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,040
um and then management starts knocking

200
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,880
on his door asking him you know

201
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,399
what are you doing with your time why

202
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,600
are you wasting time um

203
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,120
while he was writing it he was writing

204
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,079
the the manual uh of how to use it

205
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,920
uh in and the the manual he decided to

206
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,240
put

207
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
like online as in on the machine itself

208
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
rather than just printing it out

209
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,920
um which meant inventing type setting

210
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
uh sorry a type setting program to go

211
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,120
with it so that was also part of the

212
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,399
operating system was type setting

213
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,079
so that's what he sold to management

214
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,519
this is a typesetting program

215
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,600
for all of the secretaries around the

216
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,120
world so that they can make nice

217
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,640
formatted documents

218
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,440
to sell to other bits of management um

219
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,519
so essentially unix started off as a

220
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,000
video

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
game that turned into a printer it's now

222
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,480
2020 unix is still not very good at

223
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,519
either of those tasks

224
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,800
but here we are so

225
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,000
what happened to unix after that it went

226
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,120
to college

227
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,320
it met some people and it got a job um

228
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,760
the college it went to was the

229
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,519
university of berkeley which is the

230
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,720
university

231
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,440
around here um it's not too far from

232
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,959
where i live in oakland

233
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,120
uh this uh photo is a

234
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,160
photo of the university of berkeley um

235
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,000
so there were some

236
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,360
so the software at the time uh was

237
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,160
distributed

238
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,720
uh with the source code it was um just

239
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
sort of the way things work you

240
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,959
still sold licenses and software uh

241
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,680
licenses

242
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,920
uh and source code with the software so

243
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,760
people could debug it and fix it and

244
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,440
patch it and what have you

245
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,800
um so these unix tapes started shipping

246
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,839
around everywhere

247
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,720
um it was you know one of many options

248
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,160
that you could use on your pd

249
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,480
on your like brand spanking new pdp 11

250
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,920
if you're a college or a

251
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,880
medium-sized to large business um

252
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,079
and at the university of berkeley a

253
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,320
bunch of people decided to start

254
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,440
adding stuff to it um somebody wrote an

255
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,519
annotated guide as the lions guide to

256
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,720
to unix the lion the lions guide because

257
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,399
it was because unix was written in a

258
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,360
in a um a modern high-level language

259
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,959
reading the source code was very very

260
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:21,360
easy

261
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,639
unlike other operating systems which

262
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,800
were all written assembly which you know

263
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,600
pages and pages of opcodes for one minor

264
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,399
subroutine

265
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,160
unix had something in a modern language

266
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
that was human readable

267
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,279
um and the algorithms that were involved

268
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,200
you know could be more easily um

269
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,399
could be more easily understood uh and

270
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:42,959
so

271
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,399
university started using it as a

272
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,079
textbook um they started stripping

273
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,279
around in their operating systems

274
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,880
classes in their electrical engineering

275
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,519
classes

276
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,279
uh here's you know one example of an

277
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,800
operating system that you might want to

278
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,160
write it's in a language where you can

279
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,680
understand what's going on

280
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,399
um so lots and lots of universities

281
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:58,959
started

282
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,160
using unix in berkeley they started

283
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,120
adding

284
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,800
features to it they just patched stuff

285
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,360
onto it um

286
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,920
added some new utilities um some new sub

287
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,160
routines because it was a unix software

288
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,440
because it was uh open source um

289
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,079
and full of uni like universe operating

290
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:18,639
systems

291
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,279
development was still uh a new field um

292
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,320
they were just kind of using this kind

293
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,839
of dumping ground for all kinds of

294
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,639
experiments they write new schedulers uh

295
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,480
they write new file systems just kind of

296
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,120
like

297
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,800
seeing what would work teaching the

298
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,839
students and like researching

299
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,360
um different things about operating

300
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,639
system because we hadn't like nailed

301
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,920
that down yet

302
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,240
um so it kind of became a dumping ground

303
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,639
for all kinds of little experiments

304
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,720
including the most important one was the

305
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,279
tcpip stack

306
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,160
which was a network communication stack

307
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,360
that we still use

308
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,800
um as an experiment in university uh

309
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,320
sorry as an experiment between a couple

310
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,199
universities

311
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,160
um and this really opened up a lot of

312
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,440
doors

313
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,240
having networking now on an operating

314
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,639
system used by several universities

315
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,600
uh meant that you could start talking to

316
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,560
other universities

317
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,839
other students in the university um

318
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,440
the quote that i have up now the network

319
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,880
is the computer with some micro systems

320
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,000
logo or south summer

321
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,440
from slogan uh in the late 90s um

322
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,639
and it it sort of was

323
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,320
true um because of my background of

324
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,279
working at sun

325
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,040
i know a lot more about sun and i don't

326
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,160
i don't want to say that they are the

327
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,839
ones that like invented everything um

328
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,519
but i just know more of the background

329
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,959
so some microsystems started

330
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,000
as the stanford university network um

331
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
they created a they created um

332
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,360
uh a machine that was meant to fit in

333
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,800
the network it wasn't meant to be a

334
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,199
standalone machine this pdp-11 that you

335
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,800
know you come in and you do your batch

336
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,320
jobs it wasn't even something that you

337
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,839
log into

338
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,079
from a serial console in the same lab so

339
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,279
that two people could use it at the same

340
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,800
time

341
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,560
it was really meant it was built out as

342
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,120
a network computer

343
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,920
and this changed a lot um so

344
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,600
they built so many other technologies

345
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,040
around that

346
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,079
prospect um

347
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,639
and let's say that you're you're coming

348
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,600
out of

349
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,720
the 80s uh or yes 70s

350
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,839
and you wanted to build something like

351
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,120
that from scratch what would you invent

352
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,639
first um

353
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,480
first thing you would think is you have

354
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,320
one big machine one big expensive

355
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,880
machine

356
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,040
and a bunch of little cheap junk

357
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,839
machines kicking around

358
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,759
um because you know you you want people

359
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,880
to be able to

360
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,160
use it in their lab in their

361
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,519
uh library maybe even in their dorm room

362
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,360
um so

363
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,519
what might this machine want what might

364
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,040
you want this machine to do

365
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,440
um so first of all you'd want to have uh

366
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,240
some storage

367
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
you know people have files they have

368
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,839
theses to write theses

369
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,040
um they have you know

370
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,120
just code to run on several different

371
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,320
machines so they need to have

372
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,639
they need to have files right so you

373
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,360
know you create a file system

374
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,560
nfs the network file system

375
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
um the other thing you might want is you

376
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,680
know you

377
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,839
you have several people from around the

378
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,839
university logging into stuff

379
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,040
um we're talking about over the network

380
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,800
now it's not a local thing so you can't

381
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
really rely on unix's permissions

382
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,519
like the unix permissions were designed

383
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,320
for you know

384
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,839
two people logging in on two different

385
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,759
serial consoles to one machine

386
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,560
and sharing time um but now we're

387
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,399
talking over the network so

388
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,600
how do you enforce some kind of

389
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,880
authentication authorization scheme

390
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,079
um and you probably want some way

391
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,320
for users to communicate with each other

392
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,600
um you know

393
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,240
research labs are more than just uh one

394
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,400
person's plugging it away

395
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,000
uh you have several people that want to

396
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,599
communicate with each other um

397
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,799
they might want to be able to look each

398
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,640
other up one of them might be in

399
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,240
one lab the other one's in their dorm

400
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,079
room one might be in stanford leos at

401
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,959
berkeley

402
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,400
um so you know email already existed

403
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
at at that time um but a way to look up

404
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,919
other users that are

405
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,240
using the same system that you are um

406
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,760
which is also important if you're going

407
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,119
to be a big file storage

408
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,679
system because you know you have two

409
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,120
different users

410
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,720
right from two different machines

411
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,320
writing files on one

412
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,240
big nfs server you have to come up with

413
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,080
some kind of like authorization

414
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,000
authentication scheme

415
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,559
um some way of like knowing which users

416
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,440
are around

417
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,200
that you may not know already you know

418
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,000
if my name is john on one machine

419
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,640
how does the big machine know that um

420
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,320
so they created sunrpc as part of the

421
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,600
nfs scheme

422
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,440
um so sun rpc uh

423
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
is uh it has a new name now it's like

424
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,559
open networks

425
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,960
rpc or something like that um this is

426
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,160
still in

427
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
in most modern units this is in linux

428
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,679
like it's around it's

429
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,480
used as part of the um the linux nfs

430
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,679
server

431
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,039
um so some rpc starts

432
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,679
off you've got a port mapper on port 111

433
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,360
that you can talk to

434
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,520
uh you ask the port mapper what services

435
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,400
are available

436
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,080
it will give you a list um

437
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,600
and it's it's a remote procedure call

438
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,720
uh protocol so it

439
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,480
you basically talk to it the same way

440
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,000
you would talk to any other

441
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,200
c uh function so

442
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,440
it's just it's literally just a function

443
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,400
um that you call

444
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,280
for various different port mappers for

445
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,559
various different uh

446
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,840
rpc things um uses the unixc calling

447
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
conventions the att convention

448
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,520
um uh it has a data serialization

449
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,120
format uh called xdr um

450
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,200
when you are writing a new protocol you

451
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,880
would use rpcgin

452
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,600
um which is an application uh it's a

453
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,880
command line utility

454
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,679
um so you start off with a sort of proto

455
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,919
protocol i don't know how you would

456
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,440
phrase that you start off with a

457
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,880
like a template basically and it will

458
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,559
generate some c code

459
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,720
um you can use i net d to execute uh

460
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,200
to execute applications that use uh sun

461
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,240
rpc

462
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,919
um the there's one thing about sun rpc

463
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,120
especially in linux is that there's

464
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,039
several implementations um

465
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,280
the kernel has one for the kernel uh nfs

466
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,320
server

467
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,640
glib c has one there's probably a few

468
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,840
more kicking around

469
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
and whenever there's several

470
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,120
implementations of something

471
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,559
there's always bugs kicking around we

472
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,320
see this like everywhere uh

473
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,679
xml parsers and json parsers etc

474
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,280
um and there have been historically a

475
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,520
bunch of bugs in sun rbc both on solaris

476
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,879
itself as well as in linux

477
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,159
but this still exists in your linux

478
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,960
today if you go to any random ubuntu box

479
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,039
um you will find implementations of sun

480
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,159
rpc kicking around

481
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,200
despite it being designed for remote

482
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,919
procedure calls on a university in 1982.

483
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,039
or whatever

484
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,640
um the other thing

485
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,799
that they needed the reason why it

486
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,480
existed is because you have these files

487
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,679
you need to write

488
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,880
so you have this file server you need to

489
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,720
be able to like connect to it

490
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,760
call procedures like write um

491
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
and so you know that's why they created

492
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,200
center rpc the other thing that they

493
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,640
needed for nfs

494
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,799
was the vfs layer so vfs is the virtual

495
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,159
file system layer

496
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,080
um it has originally unix had

497
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,480
read write open stat a bunch of other

498
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,919
file calls that your applications would

499
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,760
call when they need to do work

500
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,960
uh on files and in unix everything is a

501
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,679
file

502
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,039
um and that was pretty like

503
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,640
deeply embedded in the kernel and how

504
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,559
that worked so

505
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,840
for nfs uh

506
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,000
the vfs layer was added and and this

507
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,520
allowed um

508
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,159
this allowed people to use multiple

509
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,640
different

510
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,640
file systems uh with the same interfaces

511
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,799
so you could read and write et cetera

512
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,159
and then somewhere would end up

513
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,360
talking to the correct one you could use

514
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:27,760
the

515
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,320
the fast file system the the proper unix

516
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,280
file system

517
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,200
it could be an nfs store and now as an

518
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,720
application you didn't have to care

519
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,840
um you just read and write to files

520
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,200
um and the bff layer is

521
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,440
is you know standard it's used for

522
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,320
everything

523
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,520
um there's a page cache the one the

524
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,080
the block diagram i have up now is the

525
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,120
modern linux

526
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,840
vfs system sort of abbreviated there's

527
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,480
some more

528
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,960
stuff in there um but you know like it's

529
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,080
around uh

530
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,720
file systems are the same as far as

531
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,080
applications are concerned

532
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,200
and the implementation code between the

533
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,799
kernel vfs layer and applications

534
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,720
the only thing a file system developer

535
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,000
needs to do is write something

536
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,080
that speaks uh vfs semantics

537
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,399
um

538
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,320
the other thing that uh the other thing

539
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,080
about file systems is we have kicking

540
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,000
around something called the auto mounter

541
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,360
um this is still in linux today um

542
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,000
you can use uh you can set it up to use

543
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,120
um

544
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,120
uh uh remote home directory automatic

545
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,799
home directory so if you're a new user

546
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,240
logging into

547
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,200
uh logging into a machine it can check

548
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,640
the various databases

549
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,080
and make sure your home directory is

550
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,639
still there

551
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,080
it's sort of a key play uh key set of

552
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,440
places to look

553
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,960
um but

554
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,039
so say so say this is the case you do

555
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,159
log into a machine

556
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,720
um and you're a new user that has never

557
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,000
touched this machine before

558
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,120
and it's using the automator to pull uh

559
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,880
your home directory from another nfs

560
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
server somewhere because you know

561
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,640
um you need that um there are ways to

562
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,919
figure out who you are

563
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,919
um naming services uh

564
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,120
the naming services switch is still used

565
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
um there's not really another way to do

566
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,159
it uh

567
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,799
it's sort of a complicated piece of code

568
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,919
sort of not

569
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,559
um kind of tied into lots of stuff the

570
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,520
the uh sorry the dance

571
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,120
um the naming services switch allows you

572
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,679
to do things like uh

573
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,880
like look up um ethernet numbers

574
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,080
groups hosts like host names

575
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,600
passwords shadow passwords etc

576
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,120
um this

577
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,320
is a functionality that's around

578
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,679
um for nist

579
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,760
plus or sorry for nist the network

580
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,039
information services

581
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,960
which was a way for there to be a

582
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,120
centralized repository of all the naming

583
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,320
um naming and emails and host names and

584
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,799
what have you anything to do with

585
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,640
with names um

586
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,240
to switch sort of switch between them

587
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,760
they're configurable so you can

588
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,360
you can talk to nist you can talk to

589
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,799
ldap you can talk to dns

590
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,400
um depending on how you have it set up

591
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,760
you can talk to just local files which

592
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,679
is how most systems are set up

593
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,520
you assume that your password is sorry

594
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,559
you assume that your username and

595
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,320
password comes with a password file

596
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,320
um if it on a default installation this

597
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,440
is probably true

598
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,200
but this is configurable you can set it

599
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,880
up so that instead of

600
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,720
pulling from etsy password it pulls from

601
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,640
ldap which is the whole point of the

602
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,720
name services switch

603
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,600
um if you are an application trying to

604
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,480
talk to the internet

605
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,360
uh trying to talk to dns this is sorry

606
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,760
um

607
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,960
this is what you think that it looks

608
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,799
like your app talks to a dns server it

609
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,480
gets a result and then you start talking

610
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,000
to an ip address doing whatever it is

611
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,640
you want

612
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,360
in reality what happens is you call get

613
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,440
host by name goes into libsy goes to the

614
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,120
name services cache daemon

615
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,400
and if there's a cache hit it will

616
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,320
return if there isn't it goes into the

617
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,159
naming services switch to start looking

618
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:20,880
up

619
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,360
who where to start looking for this

620
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,120
there's potentially several services if

621
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,640
i look at the etsy hosts file if i look

622
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,559
at ldap i look at this

623
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,960
um and if it fails at all of those then

624
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,880
it will start looking at the dns

625
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,360
it'll go out call dns come back with a

626
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,600
result and give it back to you

627
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,279
it's a lot more complicated than what

628
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,200
you're initially sold which is you know

629
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,240
you talk to

630
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,960
your app talks to dns and then gets a

631
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,080
result back

632
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,520
there's actually a lot of things going

633
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,679
on there and there's several daemons

634
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,679
and several pieces of code that are

635
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,159
involved

636
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,720
and yeah i guess it's more complicated

637
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,760
than you think

638
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,039
um so now we have all of these

639
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,279
these facilities kicking around um

640
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,760
and you have like random people talking

641
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,159
to your machine you have undergrads

642
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,760
um you have researchers you have

643
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,960
uh support staff in a university uh boy

644
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,919
wouldn't it be great if we had some

645
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,799
security

646
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,240
how are we gonna do that um

647
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,120
so the the first sort of i guess

648
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,760
facility that

649
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,400
um you may or may not you may not be

650
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,720
familiar with pam uh that's unpluggable

651
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,640
authentication manuals

652
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,840
modules um

653
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,679
uh pam is a facility for authorization

654
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,159
session management uh and there's a

655
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,720
couple others

656
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,960
um

657
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,880
session management is stuff like uh

658
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,159
logging the

659
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,480
w10 utep databases so when you log into

660
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,679
a machine

661
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,279
there is a

662
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,120
there's a log of who uh

663
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,960
who is logged in before um

664
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,120
you can access it with last when you log

665
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,080
into a machine and

666
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,240
you see the banner that says last login

667
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,000
at you know whatever time

668
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,399
that also pulls from utep and w10 uh

669
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,080
they've been extended these are

670
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,720
legacy files but whatever um unless

671
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,520
somebody's deleted it

672
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,120
nefariously um then

673
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,000
this is a very primitive way of logging

674
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,440
access

675
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,720
for auditing later

676
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,799
and it still exists the utep and wtm

677
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,080
databases still exist

678
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,399
once we got uh hosts allow and host deny

679
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,000
you know you might not want every single

680
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,159
machine on the university network to be

681
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,320
able to talk to your particular

682
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,480
uh nfs server say you're the chemistry

683
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,760
department you probably don't want the

684
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,600
philosophy department talk to your nfs

685
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,480
server

686
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,240
um they don't need to they could i guess

687
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,840
um so they created kind of a primitive

688
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,720
firewall

689
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,480
um and these are your hosts allowing

690
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,240
host denied in

691
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,600
the the firewall like uh can limit by

692
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,039
subnet or by hostname

693
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,039
uh all of which are spoofable of course

694
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,559
um and it can also do

695
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,720
things by subnet or home name so our

696
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,039
hostname so you know if

697
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,080
the biochem department logs in

698
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,440
uh you can log it just

699
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,279
as auditing um

700
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,799
and there's lots more uh functions

701
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,320
lots more functionality coming around in

702
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,640
unix that i didn't even touch on

703
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,520
snmp for network management um there's

704
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,360
all kinds of file system like access

705
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,640
controls

706
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,000
uh extended attributes um there's lots

707
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,880
of different ways for

708
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,640
applications to speak to each other uh

709
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,440
with you know shared memory with signals

710
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,080
um

711
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,360
lots of stuff and threading i'm yeah

712
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,720
there there's lots going on

713
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,240
um this talk sort of i'm

714
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,000
kind of fleshing out a much larger one

715
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,200
um on just more and more stuff that's in

716
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,559
unix that you may not have ever

717
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,559
encountered you may have encountered and

718
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,840
don't know what it does

719
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
um and you know you may not have even

720
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,559
heard of it

721
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,679
uh lots of stuff has been picked up over

722
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,320
the years

723
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,679
uh in unix um all kind of stemming from

724
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,559
the idea of

725
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,799
you know one machine on a university

726
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,640
becomes several machines on a university

727
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,600
network

728
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,799
um becomes commercialized

729
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,679
becomes operational we've picked up a

730
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,440
lot of craft over the years unix is 40

731
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,559
years old

732
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,080
um and in those 40 years

733
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,080
subsystems continue to exist because

734
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,440
they're used nis

735
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,120
the network information service invented

736
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,279
in like 1981 or whatever that was

737
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,440
um is still around and still being used

738
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,679
in production by some

739
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,799
organizations even though mostly if

740
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:09,600
you're going to

741
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,360
set up a new one you probably wouldn't

742
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,200
use nis you would probably use something

743
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,520
like

744
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,639
fcd or whatever

745
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,840
so now i'm going to switch into bread

746
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,039
um and this is the same slide from

747
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,120
before who do i think i am

748
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,399
uh my family uh

749
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,120
is russian mennonite um they were

750
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,320
peasants

751
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,520
uh growing like pet peasant farmers in

752
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,399
russia

753
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,360
soviet union came out came around uh

754
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,039
collectivization happened

755
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,159
they were kulax so they left um they

756
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,000
went to paraguay

757
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,320
where they lived on a colony uh

758
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,279
literally a colony um it was a farm the

759
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,120
world kind of changed around them

760
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,720
they're off in the sticks somewhere

761
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,159
having not really known anything other

762
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:02,559
than

763
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,559
being a russian peasant um so

764
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,000
they did things the old way um

765
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,159
eventually my family moved to canada

766
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,440
where i was born

767
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,399
um but you know my my grandmother still

768
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,080
baked in the old way you know

769
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,960
you throw a bunch of stuff into a pot

770
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,440
and

771
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,640
when it feels right you make it um

772
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,159
and i learned i learned baking for my

773
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,760
grandmother um

774
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,159
and kind of just never stopped um being

775
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,440
a history buff

776
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,519
uh i got interested in in what

777
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,360
food looked like before we started

778
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,880
getting at it um

779
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,120
i went on a real binge on the columbian

780
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,640
exchange for a while which is

781
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,919
uh when new world foods came to the old

782
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:48,720
world

783
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,840
um things like peppers

784
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,200
did not exist in europe prior to the

785
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,600
15th century and

786
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,600
you know started learning about bread

787
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,960
so ancient bread um this is a

788
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,799
loaf that was preserved from pompeii

789
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,039
which was the second century bc

790
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,880
um so by this point bread was already

791
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,080
like

792
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,000
like well in in

793
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,919
sort of well in circulation uh it was

794
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,519
super common there was bakeries if you

795
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,880
ever go to pompei it's awesome

796
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,200
um but there's crane mills and granaries

797
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,799
and bakeries everywhere

798
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,799
um really cool to wander around they

799
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,960
have you know chunks of preserved bread

800
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,720
from the the eruption

801
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,200
but where did bread start um

802
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,320
there is evidence of of uh

803
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,640
a primitive kind of flatbread from

804
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,600
thirty thousand years

805
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,519
uh ago um

806
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,600
largely as as starch on rocks so it was

807
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,159
pretty

808
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,159
uh it was evident that what was

809
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,080
happening was was bread being

810
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,799
bred or some kind of grain-based food

811
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:01,840
was being made because

812
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,519
they had been grinding grains there's

813
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,760
start there's ground starch on rocks so

814
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,799
there's flour

815
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,200
um and that was probably used for a

816
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,000
primitive

817
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,279
form of flatbread um

818
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,279
so later what happened um which we have

819
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,320
more evidence for

820
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,919
uh is uh agriculture happened

821
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,840
um there's there's several different

822
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,679
kinds of of

823
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,440
there are several crops that we call the

824
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,960
neolithic founder crops

825
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,240
and these are the first things that

826
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,960
humans started cultivating um

827
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,760
there's three cereals four pulses and

828
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,559
phlox

829
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,760
um the cereals were you know we found

830
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,480
grass

831
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,240
grass was edible it made a good flat

832
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,200
bread so we started growing it

833
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,679
uh those grasses are

834
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,279
the modern names for them are emmer iron

835
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,960
corn and barley they're all uh

836
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,279
hammer and iron corn are precursors to

837
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,000
modern

838
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,279
wheat uh barley is

839
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,720
you know barley it's deleted

840
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,799
um they are domesticated in the early

841
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:07,679
holocene

842
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,040
uh so they they all predate pottery um

843
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,839
so they're they are found in the farming

844
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,440
communities of the fertile crescent

845
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,879
which is the part of

846
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,399
uh northern africa in

847
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,639
the near east which is turkey uh in the

848
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,839
middle east

849
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,639
um and they form the basis of

850
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,409
agriculture

851
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:28,480
[Music]

852
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,839
uh for the western world

853
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,879
um so

854
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,918
ancient grains this is an example this

855
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:38,639
is

856
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,199
four bowls of grains i've got here um

857
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,719
there's emmer iron corn

858
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,079
and rye and modern wheat um so

859
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,760
the the top left here

860
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,199
is uh hammer the top right is rye

861
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,599
the bottom left is einkorn or sorry yeah

862
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,119
the bottom half does iron corn and the

863
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:57,920
bottom right

864
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,400
is you know modern just red hard wheat

865
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,320
um so they all look different

866
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,280
um the i think the iphone tried to

867
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,480
beautify this a little bit

868
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,599
um but you can tell side to side that

869
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,000
einkorn and wheat uh are fairly similar

870
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,359
in color with einkorn being a little bit

871
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,160
paler

872
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,640
uh ammo is very dark ryan has kind of a

873
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,960
greenish grayish tinge to it

874
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,960
um the the two interesting ones here are

875
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
um to me anyways uh are emery and

876
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,240
einkorn which are the

877
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,079
the two like neolithic founder crops

878
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,920
these have existed as long as humans

879
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,760
have had agriculture and they predate

880
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,440
pottery um amer is a 28 chromosome

881
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,320
um so okay modern wheat has 42

882
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,560
chromosomes in it emirates 28.

883
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,599
um it's native to the area of sort of

884
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,000
israel

885
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,079
and iran this is where it's native to as

886
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,359
in like grows

887
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,480
wildly uh initially

888
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,440
wild hammer uh scatters when it hits the

889
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,560
ground

890
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,599
just to distribute the seeds

891
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,880
whereas cultivated wheats do not um they

892
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,480
you know stick together because it's

893
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,160
easier to cultivate um

894
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,359
amber is still around uh it's eaten in

895
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,839
italian cuisine sometimes it's pharaoh

896
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:16,320
so you use it for salads and things um

897
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,240
it was popular uh it's it's sort of

898
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,079
there's thousands of years of it in

899
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,280
hunter and gather

900
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,599
uh uh

901
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,680
uh culture i guess um so this is this

902
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,960
would be one of the ones that

903
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
they found you know fragments up on

904
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,560
rocks from 30 000 years ago

905
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,760
um it was really popular in egypt

906
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,160
um unclear why they had other grains

907
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,960
they had uh

908
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,800
barley and iron corn as well they just

909
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,000
really liked it i guess

910
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,640
um it declined in pop uh popularity

911
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,359
during the uh

912
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,240
during the bronze age in mesopotamia um

913
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,880
switching

914
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,839
to einkorn instead uh unicorn which is

915
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:54,079
the

916
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,480
one on the bottom left here as a 12

917
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,119
chromosome

918
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,520
it's a very short grain it's about utah

919
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,440
um it's not very productive it doesn't

920
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,000
create

921
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,200
like it doesn't have as many like seeds

922
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,400
as other kinds of wheats for for uh by

923
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,359
acreage i guess

924
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,320
um but it grows better in colder

925
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,400
climates and marginal soils

926
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,000
um it was used sort of in

927
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
in southeast turkey and the northern

928
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,440
part of the fertile crescent

929
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,640
um that's where it was cultivated um it

930
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,240
does not

931
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,479
uh

932
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,920
i don't know it was it was still used um

933
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,359
until fairly recently

934
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,400
as kind of a common grain

935
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,400
um i've ground them into flour i have a

936
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,119
flour mill

937
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,880
uh because i'm that kind of bread nerd

938
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,119
um so here's some examples of some

939
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,720
ancient flour here's here's some

940
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,160
examples of it ground into flour so in

941
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,200
the bottom

942
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,560
the bottom row is um modern

943
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,680
uh modern flowers there's a

944
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,680
white flower on the left there's whole

945
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,839
wheat regular wheat flour

946
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,599
on the center and then the bottom right

947
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,520
is rye flour and then the top two

948
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,680
are emmer and einkorn iron corn is on

949
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,880
the left and mars underwears you can

950
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,800
tell that uh amber's a lot darker it's a

951
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,920
darker grain

952
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,280
uh einkorn has sort of a yellowish

953
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,320
change to it

954
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,880
in ways that modern wheat does not it's

955
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
sort of brownish reddish

956
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,480
um when you turn them into a dough

957
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,640
uh you can tell the color is even more

958
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,400
pronounced um

959
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,240
for uh emmer super brain when super dark

960
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,320
rye is you know super green um

961
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,920
and they all turn into bread pretty well

962
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,839
uh here's two examples of an iron corn

963
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,599
loaf and an emerald that i baked

964
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,800
the other day um and when you cut them

965
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,520
open

966
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,520
they're really interesting uh colors to

967
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,040
them as well so in

968
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,920
the right over here i have uh just work

969
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,880
a regular whole wheat

970
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,520
then i have an ember loaf up top and an

971
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,200
iron corn both down the bottom you can

972
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,520
really tell the golden kind of yellow

973
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,640
color that it has these are all

974
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,760
sourdoughs

975
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,000
so sourdough uh is the way that

976
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,440
uh we would have been making bread prior

977
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:11,760
to

978
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,440
uh you know modern wheat or certain

979
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,359
yeast um it kind of occurs naturally if

980
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,800
you kind of just leave

981
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,760
flour and water out um but if you want

982
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,280
to do it on purpose

983
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,240
uh you get a sourdough starter um you'd

984
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,079
collect yeast you can just leave flour

985
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:30,800
and water

986
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,480
underneath the tree somewhere probably

987
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,560
with some like muslin over top of it so

988
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,760
that you don't

989
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,880
uh collect bugs as well

990
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,640
um once you've collected it you can

991
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,880
start feeding it um

992
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,440
you feed it twice a day about 10 grams

993
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,040
each of flour and water

994
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,760
um and then every other day you throw

995
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,079
out

996
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,320
half of it for the first week because

997
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,359
what you're doing is

998
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,920
doing a lot of germ warfare um there's

999
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,280
really gross stuff

1000
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,480
that can that can actually harm you uh

1001
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,520
growing in there but eventually the the

1002
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,839
the you know sourness and the the

1003
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:06,880
yeastiness

1004
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,280
uh will kill it um alcohol content gets

1005
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,839
too high

1006
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,040
um acidity gets too high

1007
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,440
um so you wanna for the first week

1008
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,200
create a little bit of germ warfare

1009
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,280
um it will smell high heaven um

1010
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,280
and then once you after the week cycle

1011
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,400
through it'll start to smell more just

1012
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,079
kind of like sour and boozy

1013
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,520
um and then you just maintain it um

1014
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,040
just continue feeding it once or twice a

1015
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,280
day um

1016
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,680
and then you can use it for making bread

1017
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,880
you make a levine

1018
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,920
which is uh sort of your

1019
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,359
you take your starter and you add flour

1020
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,280
and water to it and you just use that

1021
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,400
for a short amount of time and then

1022
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,000
immediately bake with it

1023
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,160
uh you add alicia your dough which is

1024
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,720
soaking it soaking the flour and water

1025
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,000
um ferment it proof it and then bake it

1026
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,599
um so if you want to do this with

1027
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,720
ancient grain there's a few things you

1028
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,640
need to know the gluten

1029
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,119
exists it exists in spells that exists

1030
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,560
in all the ancient grains

1031
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,440
but it's not the right kind um so

1032
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
if you try to just treat it like regular

1033
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,960
flour you just end up with a sticky mess

1034
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,480
that glues itself together it doesn't

1035
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,359
work very well

1036
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,119
um so i what i do

1037
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,440
when i bake with ancient grains is i i

1038
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,319
make it about

1039
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,440
60 ancient grain to 40 modern wheat

1040
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,960
um just to get the right kinds of gluten

1041
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,880
in there so it puffs up real nice

1042
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,079
um i make a very wet dough uh again

1043
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:32,800
because

1044
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,440
uh the ancient grains don't stick well

1045
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,240
together

1046
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,560
um you want lots of moisture for lots of

1047
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,240
little air bubbles to get in there

1048
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,760
uh amber versus einkorn um

1049
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,200
einkorn bakes a lot easier than emmer

1050
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,319
um pinecorn i the first time i used it i

1051
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,359
just threw

1052
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,520
some mine corn flour into some wheat

1053
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,880
flour baked it

1054
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,119
came out just fine uh amber on the other

1055
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,040
hand makes brick cloves

1056
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,319
um it's it's a lot more finicky it's a

1057
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,440
lot more like rye

1058
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,960
and baking if you've ever baked with rod

1059
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,240
before um

1060
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,000
so what i end up doing is um

1061
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,040
soaking taking all my water and my 60

1062
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,480
of my flower that is hammer and just

1063
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,000
soaking it together for an hour before

1064
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,079
adding like the modern flower

1065
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,400
um

1066
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,760
sourcing and finding ancient grains is

1067
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,240
also

1068
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,760
somewhat difficult you can't just go to

1069
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,599
safeway and buy emmer

1070
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,599
you can weirdly enough go to whole foods

1071
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,400
and find einhorn flour sometimes

1072
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,760
um but i'd buy the grains

1073
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,280
raw because one of the problems with

1074
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,960
so one of the issues with with whole

1075
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,560
wheats whole wheat flours

1076
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,400
is they have oils in them that go rancid

1077
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
so old whole wheat flour tastes

1078
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,800
terrible which is why i think that a lot

1079
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,079
of americans don't

1080
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,240
and this is not a slag that's why i

1081
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,440
think a lot of americans don't like

1082
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,079
whole wheat

1083
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,040
bread if you look at like photos of uh

1084
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,760
of

1085
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,960
ransacked grocery stores um the only

1086
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,680
thing left is

1087
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,960
whole wheat bread because nobody likes

1088
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,800
it uh it's because the the

1089
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,720
flower's old and it's gone rancid white

1090
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,760
flour you can keep around in your

1091
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,160
kitchen

1092
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,359
for i don't know months um whole wheat

1093
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,400
flour kind of needs to be used

1094
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,040
immediately

1095
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,400
and it's similar with the with the

1096
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,200
ancient grains because they

1097
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,640
are not white flour um

1098
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,960
so i buy mine whole or i buy my grains

1099
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,880
full when they're whole grains they can

1100
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,160
kick around a while you can grind them

1101
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:30,800
yourself

1102
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,839
uh i have the mock mill

1103
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,520
which i recommend uh if you're gonna

1104
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,560
start running your own grain

1105
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,599
um ground

1106
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,680
grant green ground immediate uh and then

1107
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,800
baked immediately with is

1108
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,800
like completely different than

1109
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,280
than uh uh uh

1110
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,560
then old flour um

1111
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
so the important part is the taste isn't

1112
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,079
it um so pinecone

1113
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,359
is a very unique taste um it's really

1114
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,880
really cool i highly recommend if you

1115
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,520
can try

1116
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,319
eating einkorn and emmer bread at some

1117
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,119
point um

1118
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,000
they're super unique einkorn has a weird

1119
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,640
kind of like

1120
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,680
sweet nuttiness to it like a pecan

1121
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,720
um emmer has sort of like a deep

1122
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,760
tannic uh

1123
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,440
i don't know deepness to it uh kinda

1124
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,960
like tea like

1125
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,880
if you think tea while you're eating

1126
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,319
emmer bread versus

1127
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,440
modern bread um it's it's there we

1128
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,119
you know it tastes like wheat uh it has

1129
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,560
like a kind of like

1130
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,040
vague kind of nuttiness i guess closer

1131
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,240
to hazelnut

1132
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,800
um but the difference between wheat and

1133
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,000
einkorn

1134
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,520
breads are like uh you know

1135
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,800
you they're dip you definitely tell the

1136
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,520
difference ry i love uh tastes like rye

1137
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,079
um so if you've never baked bread before

1138
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,480
um and you would like to start baking

1139
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,800
bread i suggest starting with a fukashi

1140
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,000
fogata is super easy it's super

1141
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,800
forgiving

1142
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,960
um a recipe for bokashia is you know

1143
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,160
500 grams of flour 350 grams of

1144
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,200
uh of uh water which is the same for

1145
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:11,760
lots of

1146
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,800
breads um 70 hydration and like a third

1147
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,800
cup of olive oil and whatever herbs and

1148
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,480
spices you got kicking around

1149
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,520
um they could you know make a bread

1150
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,599
or make a dough put it in a pan bake it

1151
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,599
for 500 minutes or bake it at 500

1152
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,280
degrees for 20 minutes

1153
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,319
and you get a delicious progression

1154
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,920
but if you want a real bread you again

1155
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,000
would start with 500 350

1156
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,720
uh ratio you add some salt sit there and

1157
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,240
ferment it for two hours

1158
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,480
um let it rise for an hour and a half

1159
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,480
make it a 500 degrees fahrenheit with a

1160
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,839
tray of water for 45 minutes

1161
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,760
um and then you get bread

1162
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,920
um tips for better bread if you put it

1163
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,680
in a dutch oven you get lots and lots of

1164
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,880
heat and water

1165
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,880
um give it a long fermentation time let

1166
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,400
it sit for four hours

1167
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,720
beat it down make a make a dough put it

1168
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,319
in your fridge overnight

1169
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:04,319
um feed your starter better slowing uh

1170
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,800
it if you want to bake infrequently i

1171
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,560
bake once a week i keep my starter in

1172
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,280
the fridge

1173
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,359
take it out on thursday feed it feed it

1174
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,319
on friday

1175

questions is there a recommended maximum

1190

storage times

1191
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,319
for this type of flower

1192
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,359
uh so so flour uh is good so freshly

1193
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,720
ground flour is good for

1194
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,480
you know a couple weeks um

1195
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,800
i you know it's it's like any other like

1196
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,680
fresh product

1197
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,720
um you keep it for a while and

1198
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,160
mostly the taste will just kind of

1199
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,240
decline um you'll lose some of the like

1200
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,119
complex

1201
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,560
complex flavors um and

1202
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,640
if you leave it way too long like in the

1203
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,319
order of like months

1204
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,319
it'll start to go rancid and bitter uh

1205
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,520
it's not inedible

1206
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,760
it's just you know it picks up bigger

1207
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,559
flavors as the oils go rancid

1208
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,880
fantastic and what was the name of the

1209
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,480
mill that you have

1210
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,839
uh it's the mock mill mlck

1211
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,640
um they the the mock mill site also

1212
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,160
sells grains but they're a reseller for

1213
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,839
somewhere called bread topia

1214
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,319
um which sells all kinds of random weird

1215
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,319
grains right

1216
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,280
and one last one what kind of flour do

1217
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,839
you recommend for making starters

1218
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:02,559
uh just white flour is fine already

1219
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,800
white flour uh a little bit of rye in

1220
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,160
there if you have it kicking around

1221
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,680
if not a little bit of whole wheat flour

1222
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,960
if you have that kicking around you you

1223
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,559
want to add some nutrients to the

1224
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,079
to the starter for the yeast to kind of

1225
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,760
grow better um but if all you have is

1226
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,160
white flour it's perfectly fine
