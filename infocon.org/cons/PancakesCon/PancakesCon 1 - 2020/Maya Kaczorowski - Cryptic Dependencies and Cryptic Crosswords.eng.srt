1
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,480
all right

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,400
so pancakes con track two next talk up

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,720
is cryptic dependencies and cryptic

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,560
crosswords

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,760
uh from maya uh kazurowski uh who

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,720
is not a first-time speaker uh maya is a

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,240
product manager at github in the

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,560
software supply chain security

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,920
she was previously in security and

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,079
privacy at google focused on container

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,600
security and encryption at rest and

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,120
encryption key management

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,719
prior to google she was an engagement

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,640
manager at mckinsey company working in

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,200
i.t security for large enterprises

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,320
she completed her master's in

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,640
mathematics focusing on cryptography and

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,440
game theory

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,399
and is bilingual in english and french

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,760
outside of work

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,879
maya is passionate about ice cream and

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,320
making ice cream for friends at home

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,160
attending the penn state ice cream short

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,640
course

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,120
in january 2014 and researching ice

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,160
cream headaches

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,239
she also enjoys puzzling running and

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,920
reading non-fiction

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,960
and for the talk how do you determine

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,799
your code's cryptic dependencies and

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,119
should

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,240
what should you do when a new

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,720
vulnerability is discovered and also

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,280
how do you solve cryptic crosswords as

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,720
more developers and companies rely on

36
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,000
open source code that anyone can

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,920
contribute to these also open doors to a

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,360
new vector of attack

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,040
there are increasing supply chain

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,799
compromises which successfully sneak in

41
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,080
new backdoor packages

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,920
use type of squatting or even compromise

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,000
build tooling and signing keys

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,079
we'll first cover common signs of supply

45
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,759
chain attacks and when they're likely to

46
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,560
happen

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,000
for developers we'll discuss what you

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,119
can do to determine encrypted

49
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,799
dependencies and be notified of new

50
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,240
security patches you should apply

51
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,759
including best practices to make this

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,360
easier on your dev team

53
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,720
we'll also cover what you can do to

54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,320
contribute back like how you should

55
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,759
report vulnerabilities you discover an

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,200
open source

57
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,240
having a better handle on your

58
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,840
dependencies let's address cryptic

59
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,880
crosswords

60
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,640
their crosswords but with every clue

61
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,399
itself being a puzzle one part literal

62
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,240
and one part word play these originated

63
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,600
in the uk and are still gaining

64
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,360
popularity in the us

65
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,200
with the new yorker even bringing theirs

66
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,119
back recently we'll explain what a

67
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,040
cryptic crossword is the types of clues

68
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,038
you'll encounter and go through a few

69
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,038
of your favorite examples you'll come

70
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,400
away with a better understanding of what

71
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,080
you can do for supply chain security for

72
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,680
your organization and a better way to

73
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,879
flex your brain

74
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,920
on a sunday morning so please welcome

75
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,160
maya to pancakes con

76
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,360
maya over to you hello thank you

77
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
um so as you know just introduced we're

78
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,400
going to talk about cryptic

79
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,680
dependencies and cryptic crosswords so

80
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,519
hi i'm maya i'm a product manager at

81
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,360
github i work on software supply chain

82
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,319
security

83
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,800
um and i'm really passionate about both

84
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,080
knowing what's in your supply chain and

85
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,360
knowing what vulnerabilities you have

86
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
and be able to address those

87
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
as well as cryptic crosswords i think

88
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,000
they're just such a fun activity and

89
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,440
such a good way to spend time

90
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,800
so today we'll be covering both of those

91
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,640
topics first

92
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,000
cryptic dependencies in your software

93
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
supply chain um

94
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,480
and crosswords for cryptic dependencies

95
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,840
we'll first talk about what a software

96
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,360
supply chain is

97
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,440
and what we mean by that phrase we'll

98
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,879
talk about common kinds of supply chain

99
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,519
attacks

100
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,720
when they're likely to happen and what

101
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,560
we've already seen in the wild and then

102
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
for developers we'll talk about what you

103
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,680
can do to determine your dependencies

104
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,800
and protect yourself from

105
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,040
potential vulnerabilities and also what

106
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,480
to do if you discover that

107
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,000
a vulnerability exists in an open source

108
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,319
project once we have a better handle on

109
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,360
dependencies we'll turn to cryptic

110
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,239
crosswords

111
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,599
if you're not familiar with these we'll

112
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,440
first explain what they are and why

113
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,640
their clues are different from

114
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,319
crosswords you might be familiar with

115
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,680
and we'll dive into the types of clues

116
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,040
you'll encounter go through a few

117
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,879
examples to illustrate

118
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,640
so let's get started with dependencies

119
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,720
um a former co-worker of mine dan wrote

120
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,840
this and it's just so

121
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,239
poignantly you know correct when you

122
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,920
pull in an external dependency

123
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,120
you don't know what you're actually

124
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,280
getting when you pip install go get or

125
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,920
maybe touch it's not really any better

126
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,440
than plugging in a usb drive that you

127
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,120
found on the sidewalk right and we all

128
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,720
know that that's bad we all know not to

129
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,680
do that

130
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,120
um but you still pull code from open

131
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
source and i don't want you to stop

132
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,920
doing that i just want you to do so

133
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,159
securely and safely

134
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,200
so software supply chain you know as an

135
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,640
appetizer for our crossword discussion

136
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,360
later

137
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,120
um you know what are we calling these

138
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,200
cryptic why is cryptic and app dis

139
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,480
introduction and description for the

140
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
dependencies that you have well the

141
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,160
reality is that it's extremely common

142
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,199
nowadays to not

143
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
really actually know what's running in

144
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,199
your environment a large amount of code

145
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,720
that a typical organization uses

146
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,960
is from open source i've heard estimates

147
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,240
from anywhere from 80

148
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
85 95 95 99 like all kinds of all kinds

149
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,919
of ratios for what's actually

150
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,600
um in your code base that comes from

151
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,360
open source and you don't

152
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,280
actually necessarily know what that code

153
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,639
includes

154
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,240
so for example if you decide to pull in

155
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,160
dependency a for your project

156
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,080
it's possible that a itself has other

157
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,600
other dependencies b and c

158
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,360
known as transitive dependencies and you

159
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,320
don't even know that you have

160
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,479
dependencies b and c

161
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,759
and it's just not possible for you to

162
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,360
verify all this code it's impossible

163
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,759
today

164
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,840
unfortunately and so where we've landed

165
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
is that you need to be able to get some

166
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,320
information

167
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,680
and manage some risk for the

168
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,960
dependencies that you do have in your

169
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,840
code

170
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,360
and any potential vulnerabilities that

171
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
those are introducing

172
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,720
so that's why the concept of a software

173
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,320
supply chain comes into play

174
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,759
think about what a supply chain is to

175
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,520
begin with a supply chain is anything

176
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,400
that you depend on

177
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,479
to deliver your end product so for a

178
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,600
pharmaceutical company it's the

179
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,039
provenance and the verification of

180
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,440
ingredients um you know they go into

181
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,199
each drug to drive quality

182
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,960
for a chocolate bar that you might buy

183
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,280
at the store um

184
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
you uh it's a list of ingredients that's

185
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,880
on that package and some information

186
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,919
about nutritional information and

187
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,280
contents maybe you know which

188
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,320
ingredients organic

189
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,680
as well as you know which facilities

190
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,960
they're produced and if those came in

191
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,199
contact with peanuts for example

192
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,240
and so when you think about a software

193
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,240
supply chain it's the same idea it's

194
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,680
everything that goes into your software

195
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
and where that comes from

196
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,280
who wrote it uh when that code was

197
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,240
contributed

198
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,759
how it's been reviewed for security

199
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,520
issues or any known vulnerabilities that

200
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,880
exist in that code

201
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,280
supported versions license information

202
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,319
if applicable

203
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,199
everything it's everything that you

204
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,199
could need or want to know

205
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,520
about the software that you're running

206
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,400
to help you determine your risk profile

207
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,080
and so a software supply chain is really

208
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,680
anything that goes into or affects your

209
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,080
code

210
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,919
from development through your cicd

211
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,440
pipeline until it gets deployed into

212
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,960
production

213
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,240
now when you're talking about

214
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,840
dependencies as i was alluding to

215
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,319
earlier

216
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,840
what's scary about this isn't as much

217
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,199
what you're developing internally

218
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,600
although

219
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,120
hopefully you have controls in place to

220
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
say prevent developers from pushing code

221
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,400
from their bathtub

222
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,479
or uh restricted who has super admin

223
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,600
rights in your environment

224
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,960
or you have some controls around you

225
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,880
know password requirements 2fa whatever

226
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,960
it happens to be

227
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,600
what's scary though is open source code

228
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,039
that developers do pull in and where

229
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,080
that comes from

230
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,759
because although open source is easy for

231
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,160
developers it also means that it's easy

232
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
for attackers

233
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,360
i don't want to scare you i want you to

234
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
keep using open source code i want you

235
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,720
to keep contributing to open source code

236
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,160
i just want you to do it thoughtfully

237
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,639
from a security point of view

238
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,560
and so if you think about everything

239
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,919
that your software depends on all its

240
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,360
dependencies right software dependencies

241
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,400
are pervasive it's

242
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,560
normal for your projects to use hundreds

243
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,919
or even thousands of open source

244
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,280
dependencies

245
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
if any one of these dependencies has a

246
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,120
vulnerability chances are that you have

247
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,120
a vulnerability as well

248
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,479
being able to leverage the work of

249
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,759
thousands of open source developers

250
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,120
means that thousands of strangers

251
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,720
effectively have commit access to your

252
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,080
production code

253
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,400
so an innocent mistake or a malicious

254
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,840
attack to your supply chain

255
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,520
affects you deeply okay

256
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,280
so what kinds of software supply chain

257
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,800
vulnerabilities and attacks

258
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,400
actually happen you might have heard

259
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,240
security attacks broken down into three

260
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,639
kind of

261
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,319
common components you know who the

262
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,560
attacker is say a script kitty or a

263
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,199
competitor

264
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,520
a nation state how the attack is

265
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,639
conducted

266
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,599
and what the attack is attempting to do

267
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,520
a supply chain attack in and of itself

268
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,120
isn't usually the goal right it's

269
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,440
usually a step towards something else

270
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
um just like any other kind of attack

271
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,879
attackers are probably going for

272
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,400
something that they can monetize

273
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
so a botnet cryptocurrency mining those

274
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,160
are common ways of getting money as an

275
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
attacker nowadays

276
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
and what's terrifying about a software

277
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,440
supply chain attack is that almost

278
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,560
anyone can attack

279
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,479
can conduct such an attack so rather

280
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,759
than focusing on the who we're going to

281
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,960
focus on the how

282
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,720
what happens when you know to infiltrate

283
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,240
your supply chain and the what what the

284
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,039
attack is attempting to get at

285
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,080
so there are a couple different methods

286
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,400
to attack your supply chain the first

287
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,520
inserting malicious code into a

288
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,400
dependency

289
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,240
this could be a purposeful backdoor

290
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,160
known malware or known vulnerability

291
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,520
or even just introducing another

292
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,840
dependency which in itself might have a

293
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,039
vulnerability or might have another

294
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,680
issue

295
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,440
so this is directly affecting the the

296
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,519
code and the maintenance of that code

297
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,279
compromising a build tool uh you know to

298
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,880
change what you can actually build and

299
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,000
how how things are built for your

300
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,279
environment

301
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,480
what's interesting here is that this in

302
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,760
and of itself could be another supply

303
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,959
chain attack right i could compromise

304
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:47,440
the build

305
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,640
through a supply chain attack to then

306
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,800
compromise other things using that build

307
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,920
tool which is kind of crazy when you

308
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
start to think that meta that meta

309
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,040
aspect of it

310
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,440
compromising signing keys um this is to

311
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,880
make it seem like an unknown package

312
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,720
came from a known trusted source i mean

313
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,839
which one of you actually you know

314
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,200
verifies those signatures on those

315
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,120
packages anyways

316
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,600
account takeover of a maintainer

317
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,640
somebody takes over

318
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,399
a known a known good account or a known

319
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,839
maintainer's account

320
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,360
a project takeover especially of an

321
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
abandoned project

322
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,959
and accidental issues like typo

323
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,399
squatting to get users to accidentally

324
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,080
pull in your project as a dependency

325
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,360
when they mistype something or when

326
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,680
they're testing something

327
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,839
and these have a few different aims uh

328
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,200
spoiler alert as i said earlier has

329
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,480
other attacks on the security the

330
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,760
ultimate motivation is almost always

331
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,880
money

332
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,320
so first introduce a backdoor to your

333
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
environment this might be targeted for

334
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,440
users of only a particular operating

335
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,959
system for example in a particular

336
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,000
region

337
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
or at a particular company or it might

338
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,680
just be a wide swath of attackers to see

339
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,760
what they can get at

340
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,000
introducing malware this could be

341
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,440
collected in login information for

342
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,640
example

343
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,399
but the easiest way to make money like i

344
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,000
said is cryptocurrency mining so

345
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,920
malware might just be there to abuse any

346
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,360
extra compute and mine you know the

347
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,120
trendy currency of the day

348
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,880
traditional both nets also are part of

349
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,800
this category um

350
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,240
in yeah um and lastly service disruption

351
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,519
this could be for example to take a

352
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,480
service offline

353
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,640
right if i you know think about the

354
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,920
security we're always needing for

355
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,839
cia confidentiality integrity and

356
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,120
availability if i can affect

357
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,560
availability of your of your

358
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,800
um software that's also an attack on on

359
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,279
you and your environment

360
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,720
so let's dig into a couple of specific

361
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,760
attacks that we've seen in the last

362
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
couple of years

363
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,760
first event stream event stream is a

364
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,680
widely used node.js library available

365
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,560
via npm

366
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,079
and when i say widely used we're talking

367
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,200
about two million weekly downloads

368
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
so what happened in the fall of 2018 a

369
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,880
user

370
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,959
write9 control volunteered to take over

371
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,320
event stream on github

372
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,079
it's a widely used package as i said but

373
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,839
also not really well supported

374
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,279
so the author welcomed the extra help

375
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,800
and even gave the new cup the newcomer

376
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,160
publishing rights

377
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,600
i want to emphasize that the author is

378
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,880
not to blame here because we should have

379
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,399
better ways to support these developers

380
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,800
and also verify trust of our ecosystem

381
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,160
the author actually wrote a negative

382
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,920
issue he emailed me and he said he

383
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,600
wanted to maintain the module so i gave

384
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,320
it to him

385
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,600
i don't get anything for maintaining

386
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,800
this module and i don't even use it

387
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,519
anymore

388
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,800
and haven't for years okay

389
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,839
then on september 9th 2018 right nine

390
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,360
control added a new dependency to event

391
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,560
stream

392
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,279
flat map stream about a week later on

393
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,640
september 16th

394
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,399
they rewrote the code to no longer

395
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,920
require that dependency and try to

396
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,600
actually remove that original dependency

397
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,200
the change was made in the code base but

398
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,399
it wasn't pushed through to where the

399
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,320
library was hosted on npm

400
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
and then on october 5th another user

401
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,560
huge glass added malware to flat map

402
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,600
stream

403
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,279
so then transitively anybody who was

404
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,279
using event stream

405
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,200
was using the flat map stream that had

406
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,839
malware in it

407
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,600
this was discovered in late november

408
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,279
2019 uh meaningless

409
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,519
sorry 28 2018 meaning this dependency

410
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,800
and malware was running for almost

411
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,880
two months before it was discovered now

412
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,720
fortunately this actually wasn't

413
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,480
that bad it was bad that we didn't find

414
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,639
it sooner but this was extremely

415
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,600
targeted of an attack the malware looked

416
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,839
to see if the host was a developer for a

417
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,680
particular type of cryptocurrency wallet

418
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,880
the dash copay wallet if the host was

419
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,720
uh it then inserted additional code to

420
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,399
be distributed to end users

421
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,920
this code in the end user um uh package

422
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,160
uh scanned the user deposits to see if

423
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,839
they had bitcoin or bitcoin cash above a

424
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:16,800
certain amount

425
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
and if so uh capture passwords and send

426
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,079
those to remote address to be able to

427
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,760
then syphon off that money

428
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,440
the malware did make it into a handful

429
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,920
of releases of that dash copay wallet

430
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,519
now the reason i love this example is

431
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,920
that it took two months to find

432
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,600
you know people were trying to do the

433
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,800
right thing people were trying to be

434
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,680
helpful

435
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,800
and it was so targeted right it targeted

436
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,720
developers of a particular piece of

437
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,839
software right

438
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,600
this is the kind of thing that we didn't

439
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,120
really think was possible or at least i

440
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,320
didn't really think was possible

441
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,120
like i kind of liken it to the um to

442
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,480
stuxnet right like

443
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,560
making something that targeted and not

444
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,320
specific in this environment is crazy

445
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,600
and yet it's happening we see it

446
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,639
happening in the real world

447
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,519
another attack left pad this also made

448
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,800
quite the headlines maybe you heard

449
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,079
this one on march 11 2016 a developer

450
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,519
who maintained a small library kick

451
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,760
on npm was approached by kick.com which

452
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,600
is the canadian messaging app

453
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,880
and asked to change the name of their

454
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,800
package the developer refused and they

455
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,720
didn't want to pay and the and king.com

456
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,000
didn't want to pay the amount that the

457
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,680
developer had suggested for handing that

458
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,160
over

459
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,639
to hand over that uh that name a week

460
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,279
late a week later on march 18th

461
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,600
kik.com's lawyers went to npm and npm

462
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,800
agreed that this could create confusion

463
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,079
and handed the kick library name over to

464
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,839
kick.com

465
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,079
so just a few days later on march 20th

466
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,920
the developer sent an angry email to npm

467
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,519
about this decision he wrote

468
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,279
i think i have the right of deleting all

469
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,680
my stuff and that's what he did

470
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,600
removing 273 of his packages

471
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,320
on march 22nd um that's exactly what

472
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,079
millions of developers experienced

473
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,600
when their packages were no longer run

474
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,360
because they were missing a left pad

475
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,000
library

476
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,360
that the same developer had owned and

477
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,000
deleted most people didn't even know

478
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,839
they depended on this library at all

479
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,120
it's a tiny function that you could

480
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,959
write yourself 11 lines of code

481
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,320
to add characters to the beginning of a

482
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,399
string and so many other packages

483
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,760
dependent on it

484
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,079
and two hours later npm made the

485
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:08,880
controversial

486
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,240
decision to republish the deleted

487
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,160
package and i just want to point this

488
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,920
out this wasn't a malicious attacker the

489
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,160
developer himself was mad obviously

490
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,360
he didn't understand the impact that

491
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,800
this would have this is just to show how

492
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,160
interconnected all of our software is

493
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,079
and how few people know the dependencies

494
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,959
that they truly depend on

495
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,360
okay another example for containers this

496
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,560
time in may of 2018 several malicious

497
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,920
images were discovered on docker

498
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,079
chromejack found 17 images with play

499
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,360
names as part of the

500
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,079
um registry docker123321 which contained

501
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,519
malware

502
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,000
the docker12321 registry was created in

503
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,120
may 2017

504
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,480
and malware was added in the summer of

505
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,040
2017. the community was actually pretty

506
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,639
good at discovering these images and

507
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,000
made complaints to docker hub in the

508
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,399
fall of 2017 however nothing actually

509
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,839
happened and the images stayed up

510
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,440
publishing newer and newer versions

511
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,959
every couple months

512
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,639
um fortinet was able to link these

513
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,639
images to a cryptocurrency mining.net

514
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,680
definitively in early may 2018 and

515
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,880
within days the images were probably

516
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,560
removed from docker hub

517
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,399
nonetheless in that time period the 17

518
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,920
images in the registry were downloaded

519
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,639
over 5

520
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,360
million times these images contain some

521
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,880
malware for cryptocurrency

522
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,480
for mining cryptocurrency locally in

523
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,320
this case monero and sending it to

524
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,360
remote server

525
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,279
it's estimated that over ninety thousand

526
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,680
dollars u.s of monero was mined by these

527
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,160
images in that time period given that

528
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,079
this is basically a toy library

529
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,639
where um the attackers whoever they were

530
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,240
just depending on users testing out

531
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,440
images by like pulling

532
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,800
truly like a random name like i'm just

533
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,000
gonna type in one two three three two

534
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,360
one and see if i you know contest

535
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,399
something

536
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,000
um and accidentally downloading them

537
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,199
that's actually a lot of money ninety

538
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,880
thousand dollars for

539
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,560
passive like passive income that's you

540
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,240
know kind of a tech tech bro's dream

541
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,279
right

542
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,160
and so this is just give you an idea of

543
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,839
if anything that's just this attack

544
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,600
gives other attackers an idea of how

545
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,120
quickly their malware could be detected

546
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,320
and how it would be handled which is

547
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,120
kind of terrifying

548
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,839
okay another example bootstrap sas

549
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,720
this is a ruby gem rather popular with

550
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,839
tens of millions of downloads

551
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,639
in march 2019 a known good version of

552
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,079
the package was unpublished

553
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,560
from the ruby gems repository shortly

554
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,160
after a new version was

555
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,560
published this seemed to be legitimate

556
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,199
with

557
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,399
signing keys matching previous

558
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,639
publications a new version number

559
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,720
um and i'll get into the second but this

560
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,920
actually suggests that maybe an attacker

561
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,199
had compromised assigning keys we're not

562
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,120
super sure how this happened

563
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,800
however this version didn't have a

564
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,639
corresponding version published on

565
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,079
github and

566
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,680
as another developer quickly discovered

567
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,759
on the same day there wasn't a

568
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,320
um there was a suspicious piece of code

569
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,759
in the new version

570
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,680
within an hour the package was taken

571
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,120
down so really good job here to the

572
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,480
community of figuring this out and

573
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,120
dealing with this

574
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,680
so quickly about a week later the

575
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,279
original maintainers uh published an

576
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,160
updated package without the

577
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,360
vulnerability and

578
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,079
things seemed to resume as normal um so

579
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,680
in fact that package that had suspicious

580
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,639
code added to it

581
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,800
had a back door bootstrap sas is

582
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,160
typically used as part of the build step

583
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,839
of for front-end apps

584
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,760
in in rails and in this case the back

585
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,119
door was to detect if it was running in

586
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,480
a product environment

587
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,319
if it were it would execute a particular

588
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,760
cookie um

589
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
the company sneak suspects that around 1

590
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,079
600 projects imported this vulnerability

591
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,439
but the eventual impact is actually

592
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,839
unknown

593
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,439
and there's lots and lots of other

594
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,799
examples i can go and do here but for

595
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,760
the sake of time we'll

596
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,199
we'll stop there on the examples

597
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,360
okay so now that we have a better idea

598
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,280
of what's actually happening in the wild

599
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,679
you know a lot oh no let's talk about

600
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,679
what we can do as a developer

601
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,840
this is kind of boring advice like

602
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,720
flossing

603
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,640
or washing your hands for 20 seconds but

604
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,960
you know you should really be doing it

605
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,400
first figure out what your dependencies

606
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,039
are now that can be kind of hard

607
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,080
if you're running on github there's a

608
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,760
feature called dependency graph lets you

609
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,880
see these things

610
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,240
if you're a developer of a package

611
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,000
explicitly explicitly declare

612
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
dependencies consider using a log file

613
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,240
and keeping it updated

614
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,919
next and this is the step everyone is

615
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,360
too lazy to do but

616
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,280
remove your unnecessary dependencies you

617
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,640
don't have to patch something that you

618
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,000
don't have this is the easiest way of

619
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,039
being secure

620
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,799
having less stuff or think of like no

621
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,640
code right

622
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
no code is secured because there is no

623
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,400
code so for example in containers you

624
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,760
might use a scratch or minimal base

625
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,520
image

626
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,160
automate security updates if you can

627
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,679
automatically pull in security fixes for

628
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,320
your code

629
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,400
this is so so so important and if you

630
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,840
take one tidy away from this talk it's

631
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,880
this

632
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,559
white source found in their latest state

633
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,320
of open source vulnerabilities report

634
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,720
that 85 of open source vulnerabilities

635
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,799
have a fix available at disclosure time

636
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,039
you just need to apply them if your

637
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,559
testing isn't good enough that you feel

638
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,679
confident doing that

639
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,440
i mean i would say improve your testing

640
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,039
but also just pay close attention to

641
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,960
security advisory emails or alerts

642
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,400
or twitter or however you get your

643
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,000
latest phone billing information and

644
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,280
know that you can patch

645
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,480
testing this out and making sure that

646
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,559
you can actually patch quickly

647
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,200
is a great quarantine activity and

648
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,840
lastly

649
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,559
verify if and where you can if you're

650
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,080
part of a large company connect your own

651
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,360
audit publish the results in a way

652
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
that's respectful to the maintainers

653
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,200
run tools like npm audit to verify your

654
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,120
packages before you pull them

655
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,480
scan your code and packages for known

656
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,799
vulnerabilities and check the checksums

657
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,000
of what you pull to verify that it's

658
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,600
actually what you expected

659
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,200
so it's a really boring advice you know

660
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,039
remove what you don't need

661
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,360
and patch what you do have regularly

662
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,600
patch patch patch

663
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,200
and if you're running on github there's

664
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,480
two features i really want you to go

665
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,000
turn on right now on your repos and your

666
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,760
your organizations one is security

667
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,480
alerts

668
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,080
which notifies you of vulnerabilities

669
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,520
and your codependencies

670
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,280
and the other one is automated security

671
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,200
updates which for um

672
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,400
a variety of different environments

673
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,919
including packages from composer maven

674
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,919
npm nuget pip and ruby gems

675
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,320
will automatically generate a pr to move

676
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,600
you to a fixed version it does not

677
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,960
merge the pr without you approving it

678
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,320
but it automatically generates the pr

679
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,360
for you sends you it sends you a

680
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,240
notification

681
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,160
tries to keep you safe so please please

682
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,600
please go turn that functionality on

683
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,280
now if you do find a vulnerability what

684
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,360
should you do please disclose

685
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,799
responsibly that is try to tell the

686
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,559
maintainer first in private

687
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,559
check the project's instructions see if

688
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,840
there's a contact email

689
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,919
message the the maintainer on twitter

690
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,360
ask a friend of a friend if they have a

691
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,919
contact

692
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,840
you know whatever you can do you can

693
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,080
also check the projects security.md

694
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,679
metadata file if they have one

695
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,120
if they have one that should detail how

696
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,039
to actually responsibly report a

697
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,360
vulnerability that you have

698
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,200
and if you're a maintainer and you now

699
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,720
have a vulnerability to deal with

700
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,240
you're going to want to communicate out

701
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
what's going on as transparently as

702
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,120
possible to your community

703
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,440
consider creating a security advisor

704
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,559
advisory to disclose

705
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,559
this information um if you've never done

706
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,159
a release process before for security

707
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:38,960
vulnerability

708
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,640
um read up how kubernetes does it for

709
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,080
inspiration they have a very

710
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,480
clear transparent model and if

711
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,000
everything is rosy right now please

712
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,720
please please

713
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,640
create and update your security metadata

714
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,080
file so that in the future if something

715
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,960
does happen

716
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,720
a developer or researcher knows how to

717
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,120
contact you

718
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,200
um so if you are a maintainer of a

719
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,400
project and you create a security

720
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,200
advisory

721
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,280
um you can create a secure advisory

722
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,559
directly on github

723
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,799
if your project is hosted on github it's

724
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,080
open source and

725
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,720
you don't have another um cna another

726
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,440
way of getting

727
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,799
vulnerability uh numbers a github is

728
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,280
your

729
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,000
is your issuer so you can file for a cve

730
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,039
directly

731
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,400
and that then gets published as part of

732
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,320
github's advisory database which is uh

733
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,840
curated and aggregated with third-party

734
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,760
sources and it's fully open source so

735
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,600
that data anybody can go access and see

736
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,799
and use

737
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,640
not proprietary okay

738
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,720
i'm going to take some water take a bite

739
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,520
of your pancakes

740
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,360
and let's dive into cryptic crosswords

741
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,559
so

742
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,159
i've been into puzzles for a really long

743
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,240
time and people usually think that i

744
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,360
mean something like the new york times

745
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,320
crossword which

746
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,880
i am into and i like but i usually mean

747
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,559
something like puzzles in the mit

748
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,600
mystery hunt which if you haven't heard

749
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,000
of that

750
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,440
is um you know crazy amounts of puzzles

751
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,880
that you do in a weekend

752
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,000
you don't really know what's going on

753
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,120
you need to figure out what the puzzle

754
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,440
even is before you can go solve it

755
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,960
and so come to crosswords kind of feels

756
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,799
like they're halfway there they're way

757
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,320
harder than normal crosswords

758
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,400
or sudokus or whatever you like to do in

759
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,600
the newspaper but they're still widely

760
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,720
accessible

761
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,080
um they're really hard i love to go to

762
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,200
like a wine bar sit there with my

763
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,880
cryptic for three hours and only figure

764
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,840
out half of it and it's

765
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,919
so rewarding and it's stimulating and

766
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,520
exhausting and it's a great way to pass

767
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,640
the time

768
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,919
so once i explain this to you you're

769
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,159
gonna think i'm a sadist um

770
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,080
but uh hopefully if you like puns and

771
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,200
other kind of work play you're gonna

772
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,600
love this kind of thing too

773
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,640
so i'm sure some of you have done

774
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,720
crosswords before

775
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,159
um but maybe you're here because you've

776
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,000
never done encrypted crossword before

777
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,760
um have you ever picked up a newspaper

778
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,120
and you know maybe somewhere in the

779
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,919
commonwealth

780
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,280
and you tried to do it and you just

781
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,360
couldn't figure out why you couldn't get

782
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,799
any of the clues

783
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,919
and often these are the kinds of

784
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:48,960
crosswords kind of like the one i have

785
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,919
on the screen here that has

786
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,000
just had a lot of extra block boxes not

787
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,280
necessarily but sometimes you have a lot

788
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,640
more boxes than you expect

789
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,960
the grids um may or may not be

790
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,080
symmetrical

791
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
um you know so you've probably seen the

792
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,520
crypto crossword before

793
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,640
but you just didn't realize that's what

794
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,320
you're looking at you'll find them

795
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,440
everywhere in the uk

796
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
in some newspapers in canada and in the

797
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,039
us and the wall street journal and as of

798
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,799
recently the new yorker

799
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,720
so here's the grid for yesterday's

800
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,280
cryptic puzzle at simplydailypuzzles.com

801
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,320
and uh you know in classic uh speaker

802
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,159
fashion i made these slides last night

803
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,840
so we're gonna use examples directly

804
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,200
from that puzzle

805
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,280
today so what is a cryptic crossword and

806
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,559
why is it hard for you to solve

807
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,320
if you're normally good at crosswords

808
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,159
what's different well a cryptic

809
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,760
crossword is basically a normal

810
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,039
crossword puzzle

811
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,720
but each individual clue in and of

812
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,320
itself has its own puzzle

813
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,080
right that sounds crazy and confusing

814
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,760
and it is and that's what makes it fun

815
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,039
to solve

816
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,320
a famous puzzle setter zed said a good

817
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,000
cryptic clue contains three elements

818
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,640
a precise definition a fair subsidiary

819
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,840
indication we'll get into what that

820
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
means in a second but uh

821
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,320
we'll call that word play and nothing

822
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,760
else there should be nothing else in the

823
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,000
puzzle to confuse you

824
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,480
so when i say that each clue is its own

825
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,039
puzzle

826
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,559
thankfully these generally follow some

827
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,080
standard structure

828
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,600
each clue will have a literal half where

829
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,799
the clue is about the meaning of the

830
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,760
word

831
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,279
and a word play half where the clue

832
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,039
tells you how to modify words or letters

833
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,240
to get the solution

834
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,919
the literal half is sometimes called a

835
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,600
definition or a meaning

836
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,039
it's like a normal crossword you are

837
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,200
familiar with part of it the word play

838
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,279
half is basically a rebus or a recipe

839
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,480
and it says something like you know

840
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,080
scramble these letters and insert this

841
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,240
other letter and then read it backwards

842
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,679
there are standard patterns for what

843
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,960
this means and how to apply them and

844
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,799
we'll get to that in a second

845
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,520
a few things worth calling out first

846
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,799
it's standard that the literal and the

847
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,159
word play are each at different

848
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,840
ends of the clue what i mean by that is

849
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,039
that it could be literal first then

850
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,320
wordplay second

851
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,080
or wordplay first and little second but

852
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,600
you can't really have like wordplay in

853
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,120
the middle of the literal or alternate

854
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,360
words or anything like that

855
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,440
second unless it's a really obscure word

856
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,440
or a really poorly written clue

857
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,880
you'll know that you have the right

858
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,120
answer if the word play gets you a real

859
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,520
word

860
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,360
that the literal part also corresponds

861
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,799
to you're done you don't need to enter

862
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,919
into the grading or anything to like

863
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,360
check your answer against other letters

864
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,440
it checks itself

865
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,640
so cryptic clues check themselves

866
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,159
the reason we focus on the clues is that

867
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,279
the grid works pretty much in the same

868
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,559
way as a normal crossword

869
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,600
although like i said there might be more

870
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,120
black squares or might be a fun shape or

871
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,159
whatever

872
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,760
um and so since the literal portion is

873
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,360
pretty standard and you solve processes

874
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,159
like that before

875
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,760
let's jump into specifically the word

876
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,200
that's the fun part

877
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,120
so let's start with a simple example so

878
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,480
you'll see what i mean

879
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,600
here's a clue flyers flapping arms

880
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,400
and we know that it's six letters long

881
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,279
okay

882
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,960
i've set it up for you into the word

883
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,480
play section in a literal section

884
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,799
let's assume these are correct so we're

885
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,480
looking for a six letter word meaning

886
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,200
arms

887
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,039
that i can somehow get to by using

888
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,799
flyers flapping

889
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,039
it could be like my limb like an arm it

890
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,159
could be like a weapon

891
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,600
if it's a weapon maybe something like

892
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,520
swords is six headers long

893
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,559
hmm okay not sure well in the wordplay

894
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,919
section what if i break it down for you

895
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:56,799
further

896
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,640
flopping is an indicator that we're

897
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,720
probably dealing with an anagram clue

898
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,559
so now i'm thinking i need to anagram

899
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,000
the word flyers

900
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,080
which works since it has six letters

901
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,559
into a new word for arms

902
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,480
and we find rifles if i flap flyers

903
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,279
i get a word for arms since the word

904
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:15,760
play

905
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,520
literal and the word play in the literal

906
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,480
match we know that we found the answer

907
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,840
so now you're hopefully getting the idea

908
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,120
of just how much of a mind these

909
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,600
clues are and why they're so much fun

910
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,799
okay so as i mentioned wordplay has a

911
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,080
couple of different standard patterns

912
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,919
that clues will generally follow

913
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,840
um there's not that many kinds um the

914
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,279
still text i'm getting used to

915
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,159
anagrams additions removals reversals

916
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,480
hidden words and homophones

917
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,159
and these types of clues are broken down

918
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,840
in lots of different references but i've

919
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,279
based what i'm referring to here

920
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,440
off of the book uh the times is how to

921
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,720
crack cryptic crosswords if you're

922
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,840
getting started that's a great book i'll

923
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,480
link to it at the end let's go into each

924
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,679
of these in a little bit more detail so

925
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,520
you get the idea

926
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,600
an anagram an anagram is when the word

927
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,799
play clue

928
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,320
when the word play clues a phrase that

929
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,679
you're going to anagram to get a new

930
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,880
word it's what we just did with

931
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,840
rifles earlier for scattered rain in

932
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,880
this country

933
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,440
scattered tells us to anagram a word if

934
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,799
we entertain the word reign

935
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,640
we get iran which is a four-letter

936
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,840
country

937
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,360
you'll be clued an enneagram by some

938
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,120
turn of phrase meaning scrambled or

939
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,039
crazy or odd or incorrect

940
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,399
lots and lots of different words can be

941
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,080
used here the puzzle setter is going to

942
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,679
pick a word that sounds like it belongs

943
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,880
in the phrase so look for something

944
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,799
confusing

945
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,919
i found that these are some of the most

946
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,200
common types of clues and some of the

947
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,399
easies when you're just getting started

948
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,320
especially if you're given length of

949
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,640
puzzle answers see if there's a word or

950
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,840
words that can have the right number of

951
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,440
letters next to an indicator

952
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,120
and try anagraming them an addition

953
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,480
is when a clue tells you to put several

954
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,880
words together including inserting a

955
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,640
word or letter into another word

956
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,159
when i say letter it's because things

957
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,240
like love might mean the letter of zero

958
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,120
as a letter o

959
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,399
referring to the score of zero and

960
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,960
tennis or roman numerals or common

961
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,000
abbreviations like

962
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,360
r or d for republican and democrat

963
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,080
wordplay for arrive holding container to

964
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,919
join together

965
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,760
holding tells us this is an insertion

966
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,000
clue we take a word for arrive

967
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,399
which is come and insert a word for

968
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,120
container

969
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,000
which is bin to get combined meaning to

970
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,159
join together

971
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,080
it'll be indicated that this insertion

972
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,679
uh that this is an insertion clue

973
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,720
with words like in with holding etc

974
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
you can be told to add a word behind

975
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
another word for example

976
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,480
um some kinds of rebus wordplay like

977
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,679
this where you add a bunch of parts of

978
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,000
words

979
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,840
is probably the other most common type

980
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,279
of clue after

981
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,720
anagrams in american cryptics

982
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
a removal tells you to cut off part of a

983
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,240
word or phrase often at the beginning or

984
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,039
the end

985
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,039
you'll then be left with a new word

986
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,240
there actually weren't any examples of

987
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,520
this in yesterday's puzzle

988
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,000
so here's another example remove end off

989
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,039
of adorable

990
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,279
we take a word for adorable cute and

991
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,720
take the end off of it to get a word

992
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,159
meaning remove

993
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,320
cut i really like this one because

994
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,440
remove

995
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,559
could have been the thing including the

996
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,919
word play but here it's actually the

997
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:00,799
definition

998
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,399
so a great example of the author

999
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,080
choosing words to extra confuse you

1000
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,559
this will be indicated with off remove

1001
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,520
cut short

1002
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,200
almost headless or other words

1003
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,559
suggesting something isn't complete

1004
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,360
a reversal tells you to flip a word

1005
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,559
a part of a word to get another word um

1006
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,360
wordplay for ring up about a one garden

1007
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,720
shrub

1008
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
tells you to look for a reversal because

1009
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,080
of up

1010
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,679
we find a word uh for ring call

1011
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,360
and then insert a word for one in this

1012
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,200
case letter i and then you read it

1013
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,840
backwards and you get

1014
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,200
lylic know that this example didn't just

1015
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,399
use one kind of clue

1016
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,000
many will use many different kinds of

1017
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,440
moves together

1018
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,880
unfortunately or fortunately i'm not

1019
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,840
sure because this makes the puzzle

1020
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,279
harder

1021
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,559
this will be indicated with something

1022
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,640
like in reverse telling you to look

1023
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,760
backwards

1024
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,200
up is also a way of telling it it's

1025
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
reversal because if it's a down clue

1026
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,320
up is backwards

1027
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,640
a hidden clue in wordplay is when you

1028
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,960
have another word hidden in a phrase

1029
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
a common situation is that between two

1030
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,480
words if you like remove the space you'd

1031
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,000
find another word hidden in there

1032
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,159
um this is especially commonly used for

1033
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,520
proper nouns that you might be trying to

1034
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,159
hide in

1035
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,799
in wordplay um a hidden clue can also

1036
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,159
tell you look for individual letters

1037
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:20,880
that are hidden

1038
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,480
or you know for example every other

1039
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,919
letter in a phrase or as the first

1040
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,679
letter of every word

1041
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,159
so wordplay here for pretends some

1042
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,440
woman's born

1043
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,200
some tells us we can look for some

1044
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,640
hidden words

1045
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,880
we look for a word meaning portense in

1046
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,760
some of the letters

1047
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,559
of women's corn and see omens starting

1048
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,000
in women

1049
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,080
here and ending in the first letter of

1050
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,480
scorn

1051
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,120
hidden clues will be indicated within

1052
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,640
again that's a tough one because in can

1053
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,399
indicate so many different things

1054
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,240
holding or if you're looking at a

1055
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,159
particular pattern things like oddly

1056
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,080
first of regularly etc

1057
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,880
and homophones a homophone tells you to

1058
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,080
find another word that sounds like the

1059
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,440
words that you're given

1060
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,120
um there again wasn't a homophone clue

1061
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,640
in the cryptic that we were doing so i

1062
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,399
took another example

1063
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,519
wordplay for discuss location and vision

1064
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,519
tell this discuss here tells us this is

1065
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,679
a homophone clue in this case location

1066
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,080
is a place for a place or a site s-i-t-e

1067
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,279
and that sounds like site s-i-g-h-t

1068
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,240
which is another word for vision a

1069
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,679
homophone will be indicated with phrases

1070
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,559
like we hear

1071
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,000
or so to speak this is personally one of

1072
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,120
the types of clues that i find the

1073
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,880
hardest because unless that indicator is

1074
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,240
obvious i'm really really good at

1075
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,360
missing these

1076
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,880
i also find that these are less common

1077
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,519
again especially in american cryptics

1078
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,039
we didn't cover clues where you switch

1079
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,120
letters within a word these exist

1080
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,200
but are pretty rare in american cryptics

1081
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,440
as well

1082
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,600
something to note about cryptics

1083
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,440
punctuation doesn't really matter

1084
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,360
it's just there to mess with you so the

1085
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,559
puzzle setter is trying to make

1086
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,519
something that sounds like a real phrase

1087
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,120
um keeping in mind the principle that

1088
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,640
the word play in the literal parts of

1089
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,240
the clue will be at opposite ends of the

1090
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,440
clue

1091
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,960
when you take a new clue try reading the

1092
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,480
clue and taking a pause between every

1093
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,600
pair of words

1094
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,720
and seeing what you're reading makes

1095
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,559
sense then once you think you have an

1096
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,840
idea of what the literal and wordplay

1097
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,200
parts are ideally because something is

1098
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,640
hinting you towards a particular kind of

1099
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,440
wordplay

1100
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,799
then you can solve the clue okay

1101
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,120
so now that we have the basics down

1102
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,640
let's do a couple of examples

1103
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,840
from the cryptic yesterday

1104
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,840
country people have time to make a

1105
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,880
declaration

1106
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,080
nine letters try to do this

1107
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,919
you know as i go along too i'm gonna

1108
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,840
hint you towards it

1109
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,399
okay so we'll split this up i'll tell

1110
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,080
you that to make a declaration here is

1111
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,120
the literal

1112
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,399
so you're looking for a nine letter word

1113
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,518
meaning to make a declaration

1114
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,440
in the word play we can actually split

1115
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,039
up country will have time into

1116
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,240
individual words

1117
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,960
country could be state people could be

1118
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,600
men

1119
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,320
and time is the letter t and you put

1120
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,640
those

1121
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,559
together and you get statement

1122
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,480
okay let's do another one

1123
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,440
for slimmers food almost tasteless

1124
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,559
initially and costing nothing

1125
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,000
we know it's a hyphenated word with

1126
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
three letters and four letters

1127
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,279
and again i'll tell you that four

1128
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,640
slimmers is the literal here

1129
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,840
okay we can take food almost tasteless

1130
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,880
initially

1131
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,559
and take the first initials of food

1132
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,000
almost tasteless to get fat

1133
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,440
then a word for costing nothing is free

1134
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,720
add these together and we get fat free

1135
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,960
which is for slumbers

1136
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,720
and last one i like this one in

1137
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,080
yesterday's puzzle because i learned a

1138
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,799
new word

1139
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,640
um and that's one of the reasons i like

1140
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,320
doing puzzles

1141
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,120
duck finding a meal on lake for letters

1142
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,880
once again i'll give you the split and

1143
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,000
just tell you that duck here is a

1144
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,399
literal

1145
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,520
so what are some meals well there's

1146
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,639
lunch dinner

1147
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,639
breakfast okay well what about tea

1148
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,079
since cryptic crosswords originated in

1149
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,159
the uk you'll find lots of british isms

1150
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,679
and crossword puzzles

1151
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,520
um just be happy that this is about t

1152
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,879
and not some you know quicker reference

1153
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,239
that i don't know

1154
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,239
and we'll take l for like as that is a

1155
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,839
known abbreviation for example that i've

1156
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,199
used on maps

1157
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,199
add those together and we get teal which

1158
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,399
is the word that i learned it's a type

1159
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,440
of duck

1160
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,040
in fact i probably saw one in golden

1161
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,918
gate park yesterday

1162
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
okay so you've realized by now that

1163
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,800
clues can have multiple different types

1164
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,520
of wordplay

1165
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,679
which makes this extra complicated and

1166
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,800
fun

1167
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,239
uh but you don't need to solve these on

1168
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,079
your own i use a lot of online tools to

1169
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,000
look up synonyms anagram words or help

1170
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,200
find words that match a particular

1171
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,240
pattern

1172
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,440
but the best aid that you have is

1173
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,839
patience and sometimes you find the

1174
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,440
answer and you just know it's the answer

1175
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,000
and it's

1176
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,599
it takes you a while to figure out why

1177
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,200
and verify and that's kind of part of

1178
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,640
that's fun too

1179
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,079
so the couple extra twists that you can

1180
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,920
make that you can take to make cryptics

1181
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,280
even more complicated

1182
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,520
um first are double definitions in this

1183
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,119
case clues might have nowhere to play at

1184
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:17,839
all

1185
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,920
but two words that have the same meaning

1186
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
so for for example in here

1187
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,119
care for business care for and business

1188
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:25,680
are both

1189
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,480
concerned so the answer is just concern

1190
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,839
um a question mark at the end of the

1191
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:32,960
clue tells you there's something else

1192
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,320
going on here with the clue

1193
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,800
or a bit of a stretch in wording for

1194
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,599
example

1195
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,480
q to see a railway being repaired um a

1196
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,760
queue is a line up

1197
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,359
but to repair a railway you also need to

1198
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,599
actually like line up tracks

1199
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,359
that's a bit of a stretch hence the

1200
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,640
question mark

1201
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,160
in some cases though a question mark

1202
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,320
also means that the entire clue is both

1203
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,200
word play

1204
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,440
and literal i know that sounds crazy

1205
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,280
like what but that that is possible and

1206
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,280
that does happen

1207
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,880
um lastly the puzzle that you're doing

1208
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,000
because remember we're actually not just

1209
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,359
solving individual clues we have a whole

1210
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,800
puzzle to solve

1211
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,560
might have additional complications

1212
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,320
before you can enter answers

1213
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,160
it'll tell you for example to anagram

1214
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,760
all of your answers really

1215
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,800
before and entering them to the grid or

1216
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,400
removing letters or remove words in the

1217
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,040
clue

1218
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,480
this makes it really hard when you don't

1219
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,520
know how long the answers that you're

1220
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,880
looking for actually are

1221
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,160
um sometimes that actually means that

1222
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,520
you don't enter valid words into the

1223
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,000
grid

1224
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,960
so extra extra complicated so taking the

1225
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,079
examples that we've done the last couple

1226
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:28,960
minutes

1227
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,160
uh we're well on our way with

1228
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,520
yesterday's crossword here's where we

1229
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,320
got to

1230
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,760
um from yesterday's class word and now

1231
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,880
that you have a few letters going you

1232
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,359
can

1233
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,240
see if you can figure out the rest and i

1234
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,119
wanted to share

1235
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,000
um some of my favorite examples the

1236
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,040
first one here

1237
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,800
brief run as of luck for shot takers

1238
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,720
um this puzzle didn't give the length of

1239
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,640
a word as there was uh

1240
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,079
other wordplay going on but i'll just

1241
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,839
tell you in six letters

1242
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,000
four shot tells you that the word is

1243
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
shot that is you scramble

1244
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,680
um the word takers

1245
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,760
and you get the word streak which means

1246
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,800
both brief run

1247
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,720
you know like in your underwear and as

1248
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,000
of luck like a poker

1249
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,960
streak what a good clue so much going on

1250
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,400
so well phrased

1251
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,079
i really left at brief run because it's

1252
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,520
something i never would have associated

1253
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,720
but so apt once you got it

1254
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,960
the second cool here curves for dad he's

1255
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,079
with sister

1256
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,839
11 letters a curve is a parenthesis

1257
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,200
um that's also a parent he and cis

1258
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,680
put together there are lots of others

1259
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,880
and i really should be writing these

1260
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,560
down but basically an amazing prosper

1261
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,280
clue

1262
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,040
just makes you realize that some words

1263
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,240
you know some wordplay that you never

1264
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,920
saw before it makes you go aha

1265
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,359
it's a great feeling hopefully you'll

1266
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,480
enjoy doing them as much as i do

1267
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,720
so to learn a bit more today about both

1268
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,920
your dependency management and your

1269
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,359
software supply chain

1270
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,720
and encrypted crosswords i have a couple

1271
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,320
of links here for supply chain

1272
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,520
compromises there's a list

1273
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,079
on the cncf git repo of things that

1274
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,119
they've seen

1275
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,320
some of the features that i talked about

1276
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,160
that you should turn on and github are

1277
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,680
security alerts and automated security

1278
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,560
updates

1279
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,240
and if you have a security issue to

1280
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,920
report your project create a security

1281
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,280
advisory

1282
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,440
and for cryptic crosswords uh check out

1283
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,480
the book how to craft

1284
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,800
cryptic how to crack cryptic crosswords

1285
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,480
by tim murray that's what i learned from

1286
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,440
and i love it

1287
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,960
and there's a couple of easier puzzles

1288
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,079
on simply simply dailypuzzles.com

1289
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,920
uh and harder puzzles in the wall street

1290
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,160
journal as well as a great compendium

1291
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,359
cryptic all-stars all right

1292
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,880
and we have some time for questions i

1293
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,359
believe absolutely

1294
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,160
so uh there was uh one specific question

1295
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,160
that showed up from a couple of folks

1296
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,400
uh earlier uh they were a little

1297
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,839
confused as to

1298
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,280
how flapping uh indicates that the clue

1299
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,960
is an anagram

1300
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,079
yeah um basically anagrams are

1301
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,320
kind of annoying clues anything that

1302
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,160
means

1303
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,119
crazy or changing or odd or incorrect or

1304
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:57,920
whatever

1305
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,599
i was thinking of flopping as like

1306
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,119
flopping birds it just means a bunch of

1307
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,400
things are moving

1308
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,599
and there's a bit of a stretch but they

1309
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,880
just are trying to say yep you're going

1310
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,720
to move a bunch of things around

1311
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,320
and anagram the word and the author was

1312
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,480
always always going to pick

1313
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,760
the puzzle setter is always going to

1314
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,079
pick a word that seems like it makes

1315
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:16,800
sense in

1316
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,480
the context that you're giving so you

1317
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,920
would flap arms but you wouldn't

1318
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,040
necessarily

1319
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,880
change arms or uh

1320
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,800
move arms or something like that so they

1321
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,079
just pick this word because it

1322
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,040
fit with the context

1323
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,440
okay so just any kind of movement or

1324
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,760
jumbling or that kind of thing

1325
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,680
correct crazy is the other one that is

1326
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,520
often pulled up anything around

1327
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,000
being mad or things like that or is

1328
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,359
typically used as an anagram

1329
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,720
hint as well all right

1330
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,160
fantastic and just as a uh

1331
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,520
as a quick question uh did i see that uh

1332
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,640
last slide again for the resources

1333
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,680
oh yeah sorry i will just leave that up

1334
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,920
hey dad there we go

1335
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,359
fantastic thank you very much uh

1336
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,280
hey there we go we've even got links to

1337
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,800
puzzles for us

1338
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,680
but again thank you very much for uh

1339
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,800
spending the time

1340
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,359
uh taking the time to educate us on

1341
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,319
these

1342
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,480
