1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,439

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,319
people that are that are logged in um i

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,240
just saw you what it's been uh

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,360
a week and no gosh i i believe it was

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,960
three years ago we saw each other

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,320
it feels like at least um

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,840
right yeah i think uh crisis time

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,960
yeah yeah yeah in fact i believe it was

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,560
only uh yeah only two weeks

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,920
right yeah the beginning of march which

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,400
feels

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,840
so long ago now there was there was a

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,239
i think it feels like that was like a

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,200
distinctive

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,399
point um and then like

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,239
the monday after that it's just like

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,239
okay the world is now changed

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,520
yeah yeah right i don't know if i told

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
you or not uh when we were there like

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,559
i actually like made the decision

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,600
on the fly that i was i was not flying

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,520
right from from nova i drove 10 hours

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,640
home

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,760
oh no oh yeah i canceled like so right

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,920
after we stopped talking i

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,479
um like it hit an inflection point and i

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,320
i had uh i basically called the car

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,000
rental company and had uh

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,119
well that morning i called the car

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,240
rental company and had you know

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,040
basically

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,200
uh changed my rental to drop off in

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,080
augusta

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,600
because i was already up there you know

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,520
in the northern virginia area for a uh

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,240
columbia maryland for a thing um and i

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,520
changed and canceled my flight because

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,479
i'm like i'm not getting

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,200
i'm just not doing it and uh since then

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,640
i haven't been back out like that was

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,840
the last time i was in public without a

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,439
respirator

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,640
really yeah i so our

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,159
our conversation actually prompted me to

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,040
uh do a little more prep like personal

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,079
prep like

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,640
uh i thought like oh my gosh what would

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,360
happen

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,479
if i could not go out for two weeks

50
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,759
what do i need right and like a lot of

51
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,040
what we talked about

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,159
helped me like get a leg up on

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,320
what i would need well then i'm glad we

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,920
had that conversation although

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
and and i guess now this is going to be

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,200
wildly public um but

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,399
uh actually no never mind i i i almost

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,758

127
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,360
morning uh where a speaker had to drop

128
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,680
out

129
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,960
due to their own uh well you know the

130
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,919
whole reason that we're here in the

131
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,280
first place right that we can't do it in

132
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,400
person con

133
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
because of coronaviruses so here we are

134
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
um you know so i'll tell you these are

135
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,960
not my

136
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,639
best slides ever particularly for the

137
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,160
paramedic part otherwise

138
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,759
um we're just we're just gonna rock

139
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,759
through this because that's it right

140
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,800
um so i wanna walk through uh some of

141
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,639
kent's analytic doctrine

142
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,039
and uh i've given this talk longer form

143
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,400
a couple of times before

144
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,080
i'll try to find a link for one of those

145
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,919
uh later today in fact you can even see

146
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,440
down here on the bottom i had so little

147
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,919
time

148
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,000
like the old copyright 2019 is on there

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,320
like just the whole like set man how bad

150
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,120
right but

151
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,479
let's talk about kent's analytic

152
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,120
doctrine because it's it's a rockin uh

153
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,199
absolutely rockin analysis platform or

154
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,039
analysis uh

155
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,160
paradigm and there are so few people

156
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
that actually follow this and i'll tell

157
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,440
you it drives me nuts because

158
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,800
um you know if you worked in

159
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,560
intelligence for any period of time and

160
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,919
for those that don't know

161
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,240
i did uh for 18 years as part of the

162
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,840
intelligence community

163
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,520
and cancer analytic doctrine is

164
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,360
something that we uh well that we do a

165
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,320
lot with right

166
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,759
it's something that you learn as an

167
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,520
analyst and some people don't know it by

168
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,240
name but

169
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,320
um they learn the analytic principles

170
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,840
and and what i've seen

171
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,960
uh in infosec as a broader community is

172
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,520
that

173
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
we are trying to reinvent the wheel on a

174
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,440
consistent basis right

175
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,639
um where we say well i mean this is

176
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,639
un unprecedented how many times were the

177
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,160
word unprecedented in the last couple

178
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,759
weeks right but but we run into all

179
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,840
these problems right we're like well how

180
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,759
can we do this analysis because

181
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,000
we've never had to do analysis like this

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,360
before and it turns out the cancer

183
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,560
analytic doctrine

184
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,759
from world war ii era right it turns out

185
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,520
that it still applies we don't have to

186
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,639
reinvent the wheel

187
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,240
everything isn't new right it says

188
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,520
doctor has been taught to formal

189
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,720
intelligence analysts

190
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,440
for decades right now i'm not going to

191
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,360
say that you have to use these analytic

192
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,160
principles

193
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,440
what i will say is that the entire

194
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,919
u.s intelligence community and many

195
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,840
others around the world do

196
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,120
now if you come up with your own

197
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,720
analytic principles if you're like screw

198
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,240
can't right first off don't don't say

199
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,199
that but if you're like

200
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,199
hey you know can't uh totally didn't

201
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,319
know what he was doing

202
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,639
i can do better right one or two things

203
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,240
is happening either you are a true

204
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,520
visionary and and i

205
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,280
can't discount that possibility an

206
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
infinite realm of possibilities or

207
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,960
you're doing it wrong right now i'm not

208
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,639
a betting man but if i were

209
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,479
i can tell you where we'd be going right

210
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,919
um for whatever reason

211
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,360
a lot of folks and i say that for

212
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,039
whatever reason i mean i know the reason

213
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,560
right a lot of the folks that are doing

214
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,440
cti

215
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,759
uh all of a sudden uh they get drug into

216
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,800
and other infosec analysis in general

217
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,560
they basically have a lot of technical

218
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,720
skills but they're missing the analytic

219
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,759
skills and

220
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,599
and people get so mad when i say this

221
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,599
like you're missing analytics skills

222
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,000
part what are you saying about me but

223
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,120
but listen i mean

224
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,759
we can apply a model to this and make it

225
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,919
go and trust me uh doing this

226
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,120
uh will indeed make it go so um nine

227
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,039
steps to success right these are the

228
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:33,440
nine

229
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,520
principles of kent's analytic doctrine i

230
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,039
will absolutely make the slide deck

231
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,639
available in fact i'll make the full

232
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,000
slide deck available

233
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,199
i had to cut some stuff out of this

234
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,120
because the time but i'll make the full

235
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,240
slide deck available

236
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,680
after uh basically after the

237
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,759
presentation these are the nine steps

238
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,160
success screenshot this slide if you

239
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
take nothing else away from that

240
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,800
screenshot this

241
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,960
uh print it out put it in your cubicle

242
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,759
well when you go back and have a cubicle

243
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,440
in the meantime put it on your desk at

244
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,520
the work from home and ask yourself

245
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,319
consciously are you doing these things

246
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:04,800
right

247
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
um so number one focus on policymaker

248
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,520
concerns avoid a personal policy agenda

249
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,639
apply intellectual rigor take conscious

250
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,680
effort to avoid analytic biases consider

251
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,599
outside judgments right this is a big

252
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,759
one for us because everybody in infosec

253
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,160
knows it all right um and look i'll tell

254
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
you too the longer you spend an info

255
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,599
second the more experiences you have

256
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
the more likely it is you're like yeah

257
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,639
i've seen that i've got that right but

258
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,400
you have to really consider outside

259
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,520
judgments because

260
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,320
nobody is basically it's the whole uh

261
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,880
all of us

262
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,640
is smarter than one of us no sorry one

263
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,159
of us is wow anyway look

264
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,320
bottom line i learned teaching sans over

265
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,679
a period of many years

266
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,159
that collectively the students in the

267
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,720
room

268
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,120
knew way more than i did right and and

269
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
on any given topic there was someone in

270
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,120
the room that could best me on a given

271
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,600
topic

272
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,519
that's just the reality of it right and

273
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,880
so you have to be ready to consider

274
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,080
those outside judgments

275
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,920
systematic use of outside experts this

276
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,080
is a huge one collective responsibility

277
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,600
for judgment

278
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,080
effective communication and then candid

279
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,519
admission of mistakes

280
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,959
big big one there because nobody likes

281
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,200
to say and i was wrong let's dive into

282
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,720
some of these right i want to start out

283
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
here by mentioning cti has a credibility

284
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,160
problem right i speak to a lot of

285
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,000
executives i do a lot of board briefings

286
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,560
i actually have one tomorrow um but uh

287
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,680
remotely of course

288
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,600
um but there's a lot of reasons for this

289
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,040
right as far as a credibility problem

290
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,720
but i'll tell you that using models are

291
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,560
going to help alleviate this because

292
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,480
because it just will right you want to

293
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,240
adopt and adhere to models

294
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,120
that are going to remove these

295
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,720
credibility problems and the reality

296
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,080
here is that models are going to

297
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,040
help get consistency and it's a show

298
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,959
your work kind of thing because if you

299
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,160
don't show your work

300
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,680
and you just go to an executive and you

301
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
say here's what i think or a decision

302
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,040
maker doesn't have to be an executive

303
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,440
a manager a decision maker we are we do

304
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,720
analysis we are in

305
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,959
in the business of decision support we

306
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,640
are providing folks with data

307
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,880
to help them make a decision and so when

308
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
we then

309
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,120
when we then have to uh basically and we

310
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,320
then have to

311
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
provide that data but we don't show our

312
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,480
work uh it is a reality

313
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,079
that uh folks come back and they're like

314
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,920
well you know

315
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,399
why do you think this and the reality is

316
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,839
too they can find another analyst who

317
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,040
thinks something different

318
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,800
right and so i want to make sure that i

319
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,640
can say here's my work here are the

320
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,760
steps that i took

321
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,440
here's the model that i followed and

322
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,959
again we'll get more consistent results

323
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:21,440
for that

324
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,120
so let's talk about the doctrine right

325
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,720
number one focus on policy maker

326
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,959
concerns this is tough right because

327
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,959
at the end of the day every organization

328
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,240
is funded by somebody i'm going to give

329
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,000
you a very unpopular

330
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,680
very unpopular piece of advice and

331
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,600
people argue with me all the time about

332
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,240
this

333
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,000
infosec is a cost center infosec has

334
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
never

335
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,760
saved an organization a single dollar

336
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,079
they

337
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,640
only cost infosec only cost the

338
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,839
organization's money

339
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,399
now now listen i know we can talk about

340
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,240
cost avoidance and we can talk about

341
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,399
but listen my friends this is not how

342
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,079
executives work when they employ a

343
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,200
safety program

344
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
for cost avoidance they don't then say

345
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
look at all the money we save

346
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,959
and when you go in there and you start

347
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,240
talking about like hey

348
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,720
right we are we're saving you money

349
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,040
right that's a huge huge thing right

350
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
look they they immediately are losing

351
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,399
credibility with them and you have to

352
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,360
come in and say

353
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,720
and focus on specific concerns at the

354
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,399
business unit level right all the way

355
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,079
down to the bu the business unit level

356
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:20,720
right

357
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,320
i always ask for feedback on my

358
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,560
reporting how can i make this product

359
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,399
more valuable to you do not ask for the

360
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,399
love of goodness do not ask did you like

361
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,760
this product

362
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,600
avoidance of personal policy agenda

363
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,959
listen my friends

364
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,440
i i can't do objective reporting on i

365
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,399
have a hard time

366
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,200
doing objective reporting um on uh

367
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,839
incidents that have threat actors around

368
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,360
russia because you may or may not know i

369
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,720
kind of have a history there

370
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,880
um and uh good old russian intelligence

371
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,800
there and the shadow brokers folks and

372
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,639
and all that and look i have a hard time

373
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,079
writing about that we know that

374
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,880
i recognize that um and i get other

375
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,800
analysts to help you see my work

376
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,600
or just do it in the first place because

377
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,160
i know

378
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,560
specifically here i have a real personal

379
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,279
policy

380
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,600
agenda and i know that i have a problem

381
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,279
being objective here right so

382
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,680
find your own personal policy spaces and

383
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,760
either don't do that work or get other

384
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,000
analysts right diversify here get other

385
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,160
analysts on board to help you with that

386
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
but recognize and tell them be honest

387
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
with them and say look like

388
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
i can do analysis i can do a lot of

389
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,880
analysis but this analysis

390
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,440
now that i can't be unbiased about this

391
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,079
and and

392
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,839
and that's just a reality and it's one

393
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,360
that i wish wasn't the case

394
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,399
i would love to tell you like i can

395
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,800
totally be that guy and i cannot run it

396
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,480
but you have you have to be honest with

397
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,240
yourself right

398
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,279
one of the ways you can do this of

399
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,760
course is ask an unbiased reader to

400
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,720
assess whether

401
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,639
they think you've included any agenda

402
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,839
points in reporting now

403
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,600
now that unbiased reader i have to tell

404
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,839
you may themselves have other biases and

405
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,519
they may be like yeah you totally are

406
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,000
putting

407
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,079
kind of like the cnn versus fox news

408
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,360
thing right you know we're like

409
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,440
folks look if you're a big fox uh fox

410
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,600
person you're like well cnn clearly is

411
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,000
the

412
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,760
you know whatever they're clearly fake

413
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,440
news and vice versa right so you might

414
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,240
have some

415
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,160
some personal policy agenda kind of

416
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,760
thing without realizing that unbiased

417
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,639
reader made so

418
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,399
so just be really careful there but but

419
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,320
this is a big one a personal policy

420
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,880
agenda

421
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,200
absolutely destroys the credibility of

422
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
your analysis it destroys the

423
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,000
credibility of your reporting

424
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,600
and the problem is that once you lose

425
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,760
that credibility on something it may be

426
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,720
something small

427
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,000
when you go back and try and do

428
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,839
something big right

429
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,200
you've already lost that credibility and

430
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,760
that is not a win it's just not a win

431
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,639
at all right so an actual rigor cti

432
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,320
reports are going to rely on analysts to

433
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,839
fill in missing information

434
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,000
and unfortunately this creates a huge

435
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,160
consistency gap in cti analysis or

436
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,680
analysis in general

437
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,240
i've never performed an analysis ever

438
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,680
where i've had all the information it

439
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,120
doesn't happen and i tell people

440
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,920
regularly

441
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,560
if you don't like ambiguity cyber threat

442
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,279
intelligence

443
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,480
is the wrong and i mean the

444
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,279
wrong profession for you in general

445
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,959
analysis is probably the wrong

446
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,079
profession for you because you

447
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,040
are not going to have all of the data

448
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,399
you're never going to have all the data

449
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:06,800
and you

450
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,440
still have to go in and fill that in now

451
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,720
when you do that when you make

452
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,800
assumptions sometimes you're accused of

453
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,760
making stuff up right um and and some

454
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,440
folks accuse folks of that right

455
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,760
look here's the deal i always tell

456
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,199
people right

457
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,800
always tell people when i've made

458
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,880
assumptions and what those assumptions

459
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,440
are

460
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,560
so there's a couple things here with

461
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,320
intellectual worker first off use models

462
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,839
use structured analytic techniques

463
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,279
richard hoyer

464
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,360
on the uh psychology of intelligence

465
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,680
analysis it's phenomenal buy the book

466
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
right you have time on your hands go get

467
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,880
the book bottom line

468
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,800
huge one there use models you will get

469
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,560
more consistency

470
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,399
give credit to others right but

471
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,000
communicate the models that you're using

472
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
so i want to talk about conscious effort

473
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,079
to avoid analytic biases

474
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,000
most cti reports that i read today they

475
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,079
are chock full of analytic biases most

476
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,160
cti analysts are not trained in another

477
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,440
biases however

478
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,880
and this is critical your executives are

479
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,639
because most of them have mbas and

480
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,160
that's just a reality

481
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,639
right it's your executive directors and

482
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,480
even a lot of mid-level managers right

483
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,720
and the gmat the the test that you take

484
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,800
to get into an mba program

485
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
it turns out that the gmat actually has

486
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,800
a section on analysis and argumentation

487
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,320
and this should surprise literally

488
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,839
nobody that's watching this

489
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,920
what do you know um there's a whole

490
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,199
section in that

491
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,199
on analytic biases so they've been

492
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,040
trained on spotting them

493
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,199
and if you have not you are probably

494
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,399
putting them in your writing now i have

495
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,240
bad news for you

496
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,399
even when you learn the analytic biases

497
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,120
it is really hard as it turns out

498
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
to find them in your own writing i know

499
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,360
this because i train other people on

500
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,279
detecting analytic biases

501
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,800
and i still end up with them in my own

502
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
writing and so what i need there is good

503
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,079
peer review i need

504
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,480
to train my team on the analytic biases

505
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,000
because i want my team to

506
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,800
find them before i'm publishing a report

507
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
before i'm creating those talking points

508
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,279
that decision support to my executives

509
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,720
and directors all right so train your

510
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,839
team

511
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,279
if you build up this big team around

512
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,199
this is a rising tide raises all ships

513
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,079
kind of moment

514
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,240
build that team up around you right and

515
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,600
they are going to help you

516
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,279
dramatically right i see a question here

517
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,360
where it says diversify diversify your

518
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,160
peer review

519
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,320
a thousand percent diversifier peer

520
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,680
review right because that's going to be

521
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,880
huge within this but your peer review

522
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,519
has to know what your executives know

523
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,279
and that's again the analytic biases

524
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:27,680
side

525
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,959
we want them to be able to pick those

526
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,880
out and be like hey you just use a straw

527
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,560
man there's a texas sharpshooter

528
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,639
you're cherry picking data this is i

529
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,880
mean this is important you need to be

530
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,079
able to do that right

531
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,839
so huge huge huge there one of the ways

532
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,279
that we do this

533
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,279
is through doing peer review of

534
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,959
published intelligence reports

535
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,639
do a lunch and learn literally sit down

536
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,160
everybody's got a copy of it they come

537
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,560
in

538
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,720
over some pizza and then you fire away

539
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,079
and beat up on that report

540
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,759
game on willingness to consider other

541
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,839
judgments you are not always right

542
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,160
i am not always right period there are

543
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,440
others on your team with different

544
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,959
experience that may lead them to a

545
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,880
different and even better conclusion

546
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,480
i have a quick story here all right

547
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
quick quick story here about

548
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,880
um this woman that we hired out of fedex

549
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,720
and i don't mean fedex corporate i mean

550
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,280
fedex kinkos or now fedex whatever drop

551
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,959
and ship fedex office i think

552
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,160
um holy goodness uh so we end up doing

553
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,480
this

554
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,839
uh like she was doing a bunch of

555
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,520
shipping for us she was awesome

556
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,880
uh like shipping for us like when we

557
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
went and dropped stuff off and uh we

558
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,000
realized she had great attention to

559
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,599
detail and we're like hey

560
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,880
do you want to train to be a sock

561
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,000
analyst and what do you know she had

562
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,840
already taken like one year of college

563
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,799
and then dropped out

564
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,440
whatever but around cyber security and

565
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,559
then all of a sudden we ended up with

566
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,280
this problem

567
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,400
an incident with a logistics company

568
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,160
and what do you know like all of a

569
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,840
sudden she knows stuff

570
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,760
that like we didn't right because i

571
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,200
don't work in logistics

572
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,799
right but she had and wow mind blown

573
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,640
like she was amazingly helpful

574
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,360
right now i want to tell you though that

575
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:55,840
you know

576
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,000
it takes a lot to come down and be like

577
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,520
hey um

578
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,840
other judgments here she's like yeah i

579
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,360
mind you brand new soccer analyst three

580
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,400
months into the job

581
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,640
right and she's kind of running point on

582
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,240
not the forensic side of this incident

583
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,880
but like

584
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,480
coordinating the incident understanding

585
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,080
like you know some of the what was at

586
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,679
stake and just unique insights here you

587
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,520
have to be willing to consider other

588
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,160
judgments

589
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,000
period right so getting through this

590
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,840
i want to come through to systematic use

591
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,679
of outside experts right

592
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,679
if you're awesome cti someone else in

593
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,760
your org is probably better than you at

594
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,280
many technical topics

595
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,520
period one of the best things about

596
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,280
conferences and we will eventually get

597
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
back to in-person conferences

598
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,919
freaking network if you see me at a

599
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,000
conference and you see me in a talk

600
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,240
it is almost certainly because it's one

601
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
of my friends that's giving the talk

602
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,559
you will not see me in talks generally

603
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,400
right the vast majority of the time you

604
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,840
will see me in lobbycon

605
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,440
and you will see me networking with

606
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,520
people and there's a reason for this i'm

607
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,039
building up my rolodex right and if

608
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,160
you're one of these young guns who's

609
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,919
like what's a rolodex i mean my contact

610
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,799
list right

611
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,559
i'm building up that contact list so

612
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,480
that i can phone a friend so when i run

613
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,440
into a problem

614
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,640
i can pick up the phone twitter dm email

615
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
exchange those business cards it's

616
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,080
absolutely huge build that network of

617
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,880
experts out

618
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,600
right um i i just cannot tell you enough

619
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,080
what a

620
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,640
big big deal this is right uh facilitate

621
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
that easy access to outside experts from

622
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,280
da

623
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,360
whatever right um but uh you need to

624
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,960
facilitate that up front if you have

625
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,520
super

626
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,960
you know like you want to make sure that

627
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,640
you're not from daying something

628
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,400
uh then get some people nd aid with you

629
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,160
right this is uh build that rolodex of

630
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,520
exports as you can call

631
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,760
i'll tell you too that um one of the

632
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,960
ways that i fix this

633
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,679
in my own organization is that uh you

634
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,240
know like

635
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,919
when people think they're only going to

636
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,440
get like a shout out like

637
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
or a bonus or whatever if it's them that

638
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,440
does something

639
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,280
then that's the individual wins and i'm

640
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,400
gonna tell you like when you start

641
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,919
focusing on team wins

642
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,919
right like the the whole team one kind

643
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,919
of thing that's when people stop

644
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,760
worrying about the did i do it or did

645
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,360
somebody else do it right like whatever

646
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
that piece of analysis is there so

647
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,280
that's a big one for me uh focus on the

648
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,200
team wins i mean yes give individuals

649
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,720
credit by all means but but then you

650
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,000
talk about like how the

651
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,120
whole team came together and again it it

652
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,400
really takes some of the wind out of the

653
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
sails right where people would otherwise

654
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,440
be or sometimes otherwise

655
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,640
are a little bit uh yes anyway

656
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
uh collective responsibility for

657
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,400
judgment you may disagree behind closed

658
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,080
doors about the analysis but when the

659
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,240
report is issued the whole team stands

660
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,760
behind it right the whole team

661
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
period stands behind it when you can't

662
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,039
reach a consensus

663
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,720
have the dissenting parties document

664
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,320
their alternate opinion writing just

665
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,080
like in our court system

666
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,840
just like in our court system dissenting

667
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,039
opinion goes into writing put an

668
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,559
appendix by all means

669
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,520
but and this is absolutely key you do

670
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,120
not sharp shoot once the report gets

671
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,000
released

672
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,760
you don't like it's not one of those

673
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,039
like well you know

674
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,240
i disagreed and i'm no no it's the whole

675
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,440
team stands behind it

676
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,320
right i i cannot tolerate that on teams

677
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,760
uh once you've released the report

678
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,520
everybody's lockstep right that

679
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,280
this was the collective judgment again

680
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,640
you may not have agreed with it

681
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,159
but it is the collective judgment and

682
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,159
that's the party line right now

683
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,360
we're kind of seeing a little bit of

684
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,280
that to the detriment uh obviously

685
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,960
you know we hope that the judgments are

686
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,240
good we're seeing some of the must

687
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,919
adhere to the party line uh being a

688
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,280
detriment here in some of

689
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,640
our uh you know some of what we're

690
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,720
seeing in the world now but rock on

691
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,799
again you don't play that game come to

692
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,000
that judgment uh

693
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,760
collective responsibility for it and

694
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,000
again walk down that party line again

695
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,320
you see here or the fixing it team wins

696
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,240
right when you do team wins versus

697
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,360
individual wins

698
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,760
that's it right that that creates a big

699
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,840
uh you know a big incentive to be

700
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,520
you know to begin to contribute to the

701
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
team rather than trying to contribute to

702
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,480
you communication communication

703
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,919
communication your analysis

704
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,320
is worthless if the audience can't

705
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
understand what you're saying

706
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,000
and how you reached your conclusion oh

707
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,120
my gosh if there's

708
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,039
one thing you can do to really change

709
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,039
the game here for you it is put time

710
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,720
into your executive summary

711
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,640
and create one slider presentations

712
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,000
illustrations help you'll notice

713
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,360
that a lot of my slides here have

714
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,440
illustrations right because i have a

715
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,880
graphics artist on retainer

716
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
i subscribe to multiple services that

717
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,200
help me go find these illustrations and

718
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,679
stock art and all that all right put

719
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,679
time into these right a picture's worth

720
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,120
a thousand words

721
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,360
and the executive summary is the only

722
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,039
thing that most people read

723
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,120
in the vast majority of the time it is

724
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,240
way way

725
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,120
way way too technical get a reviewer

726
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,280
with similar experience to your audience

727
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,039
right find an executive

728
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,200
find a mid-level manager look cyber is

729
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,960
sexy right now it just is

730
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,720
and people want to help out with it and

731
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,159
that's it right so

732
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,120
find a reviewer it's well worth i mean

733
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,600

734
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,559
well well worth your time right um so

735
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,760
make that executive summary

736
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,799
non-technical too

737
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,720
and the other thing i try to ask folks

738
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,960
to do is i try to get them to back brief

739
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,280
me

740
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,640
my reviewer i try to get them to back

741
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,480
freak me on like what did you hear

742
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,240
right like what did you take away from

743
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,000
this and i want to share a quick story

744
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,880
with you where um i got some iocs from a

745
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,520
gentleman

746
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,280
many years ago and i'm shaving the story

747
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,400
way down if you've heard the full

748
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,919
version it is way funnier

749
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,919
uh but but just for time i'll just tell

750
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,159
you here that uh communication

751
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,240
is is a thing right because i asked this

752
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,080
grc person for some indicators of

753
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,400
compromise he agreed to hand some over

754
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,320
and one of the indicators that he handed

755
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,400
over was small kittens

756
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,159
and i have to tell you when i looked at

757
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,600
this indicator list and they were all

758
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,120
bad indicators meaning they were all

759
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,520
useless indicators um because he was grc

760
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,799
i get that i'm not judging governor

761
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,640
source compliance by the way um

762
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,360
obviously if i'm asking grc for iocs

763
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,559
right we've reached the bottom of the

764
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,000
barrel right and that's where we're at

765
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,320
right sometimes best bad plan wins

766
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,080
this is my best bad plan and i got back

767
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,679
small kittens and it taught me a lot

768
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,039
about communication

769
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,640
because i asked him uh well first i

770
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,080
asked my analyst sitting beside me what

771
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,840
do you think he means by small kittens

772
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,960
and uh and he says uh yeah uh

773
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,799
anyway uh i don't know all right did he

774
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,080
have a stroke i'm like i don't know

775
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,840
all right so i go ask another analyst

776
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,279
what does he mean by small kittens and

777
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,880
the guy says and i'll never forget this

778
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,240
my other animal says

779
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,000
do you think he means me cats and i'm

780
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,440
like no no i don't

781
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,880
i don't think he means me me cats

782
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,840
because he wrote small kittens

783
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,440
then i started following the logic and i

784
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,799
think we're playing like beautiful mind

785
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,159
home edition here right

786
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,159
and straight up i hit back to the guy

787
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,520
and i'm like hey did you mean

788
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,279
me cats and he's like yeah many cats

789
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,919
small kittens

790
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,840
communication was lacking here right

791
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,159
what happened was somebody briefed him

792
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,000
and said mimi cats and he did not

793
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,080
mentally understand what mimikatz meant

794
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,600
but his brain did what our brains are

795
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,480
tuned to do

796
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,880
and his brain said ah word association

797
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,320
that sounded like miniature cats and

798
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,679
later when he couldn't remember many

799
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:34,559
cats

800
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,799
his brain did other association and said

801
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,640
small kittens for the win

802
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,159
and so we got small kittens and small

803
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,600
kittens were absolutely destroying the

804
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,520
network and i would pay good money to

805
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,200
know what the mental picture was there

806
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,240
obviously where it's never going to

807
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,080
happen but if you ask him did you

808
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,080
understand what i said he would say yes

809
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,120
because mentally

810
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,279
he thought that small kittens many cats

811
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,799
were running around the network

812
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,720
obviously we did not convey here because

813
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,919
it was too technical

814
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,919
for the audience right dump the techno

815
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,520
jargon get rid of it and even when

816
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,039
people think they're dumping the techno

817
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:03,600
jargon

818
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,679
they're not get a review or a similar

819
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,360
experience level technical experience

820
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:07,919
level

821
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,000
to your intended audience let them

822
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,039
review it let

823
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,320
them tell you that you're good or not

824
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,080
you can't be the arbiter there right

825
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,760
you can't be the arbiter of will this

826
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,679
person understand and look the worst

827
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,120
thing that can possibly happen is you've

828
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,480
communicated something

829
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,960
you think that that they understood and

830
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,000
they didn't understand

831
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,440
right so canada mission of mistakes

832
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,480
my friends you will make mistakes coming

833
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,440
back to earlier

834
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,760
analysis paralysis and the fact that we

835
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,480
have

836
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,960
the fact that we have a lot of cases

837
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,919
right where

838
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,600
we have to operate with incomplete

839
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,520
information also known as

840
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,679
all of the cases we have to operate with

841
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,960
incomplete information

842
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,799
nobody likes to do that but but you have

843
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,000
to right

844
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,120
and and there are times you're going to

845
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,440
be wrong you're just going to be wrong

846
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,720
and and when that happens you have got

847
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,360
to turn around and re the people that

848
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,760
you gave decision support advice to

849
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,520
you have to go back and adjust that and

850
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,360
say listen

851
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,200
we made some assumptions here and they

852
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,880
were wrong we we

853
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,080
did the best we could with the

854
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,480
information we had and we were wrong

855
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,840
and here's our new assessment i'm going

856
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,440
to tell you the first couple times you

857
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,400
do that

858
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,159
generally my experience is you take a

859
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,760
credibility hit with stakeholders you

860
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,480
just do

861
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,640
and that sucks it's not fair by the way

862
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,240
it's absolutely not fair

863
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,919
right you did the best you could with

864
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,679
the information you had and intelligence

865
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,080
and

866
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,159
intelligence analysts know this and

867
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,520
intelligence stakeholders

868
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,760
know this and in business people totally

869
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,039
don't track this

870
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,279
and it's okay all right you're gonna get

871
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,400
over it trust me

872
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
just and somebody put in chat here mia

873
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,919
culpa would need it it's not even a mia

874
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:40,480
culpa

875
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,520
right it's a educating and

876
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,440
making sure that people understand you

877
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,640
are operating without

878
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,240
if you were clear in your communication

879
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,400
in the first place they already knew you

880
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,000
made assumptions because you told

881
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
them where the assumptions were at and

882
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,760
you told them what they were based on

883
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,520
and that's all in your report but then

884
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,799
you come back and you're like hey

885
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,559
these assumptions i made based on my

886
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,080
best judgment based on my analytic

887
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,960
experience

888
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,000
they were still wrong foster

889
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,520
a culture on your team or issuing a

890
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,480
corrected report is not a big deal

891
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,720
it is way better you are you are

892
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,760
creating a

893
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,320
better scenario giving the updated

894
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,679
decision support

895
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,559
right then you are letting them roll

896
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,039
with

897
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,799
bad and and still thinking you're

898
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,799
awesome right the first couple times you

899
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,760
do it i'm going to tell you

900
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,440
like it's a hit it absolutely is a

901
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,360
credibility it's a personal ego hit

902
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,640
it's a credibility hit within the

903
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,320
organization but i'm going to tell you

904
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:32,960
that

905
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,600
once somebody makes a a judgment on your

906
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,320
updated

907
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,039
decision support trust me they will come

908
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:39,919
back around

909
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,440
it's it's a it's kind of one of those

910
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,039
like you're coming up in credibility and

911
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,240
then it's like the first couple times

912
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,200
you want these you're dropping in

913
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,360
credibility and then you skyrocket

914
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,919
you skyrockets people know your leaders

915
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:50,559
know

916
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,640
that they can count on you to level set

917
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,240
with them even when

918
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,799
poop goes wrong right okay so real quick

919
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,600
here

920
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,960
i'm going to close out this analysis

921
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,520
portion with if you only remember

922
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,039
one thing and i'm going to come back to

923
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,799
this come back to the slide up here for

924
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,240
a second

925
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,880
right the nine steps success right one

926
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,279
four

927
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,120
six and nine those are the big ones if

928
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,960
you can't do nine and i get it right

929
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,039
start with the first start with four

930
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,080
one four six and nine

931
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,240
right policy maker concerns focus on

932
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,760
what matters to them not what matters to

933
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,520
you i don't write reports for me

934
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,320
right i mean if if i could that'd be

935
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,559
great i'd have more fun with it right

936
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,919
four avoid the analytic biases six

937
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,240
use outside experts you are not an

938
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,520
expert in everything

939
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,320
i am not an expert in everything right

940
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,760
candid admission of mistakes

941
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,679
build that credibility right because

942
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,440
again like the worst thing that can

943
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,159
happen is

944
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,520
you're like well i don't want to look

945
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,880
bad so i'm not going to give them the

946
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,080
updated assessment

947
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,399
and then somebody later right a week a

948
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,559
month whatever later makes a

949
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,360
decision that impacts the business based

950
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,039
on the old data that you have not

951
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,240
amended right

952
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,760
and just because you know something

953
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,279
changed does not mean your stakeholders

954
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,240
know that something changed

955
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,520
right you may be like well that's big

956
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,279
news i don't need to like let them know

957
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,279
that no no you absolutely do right this

958
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,799
is you know again

959
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,559
it's field of view by us there right

960
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,480
you're like everyone must know what i

961
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,760
know that got updated and

962
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,240
don't do that right on the effective

963
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,360
communication though i'm going to tell

964
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,159
you

965
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,399
i learned a lot from colin powell and

966
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,600
there's a couple of different versions

967
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,679
of this uh this quote going around

968
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,600
but it's tell me what you think tell me

969
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
what you know but for god's sakes

970
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,000
always tell me which is which and i just

971
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,799
cannot be

972
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,039
any uh cannot be any heavier about that

973
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,799
you know make sure that there's a clear

974
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,799
distinction between what you think

975
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,799
versus what you know and make sure that

976
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,159
your stakeholders understand

977
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,200
which of those it is so

978
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,440
because pancakes con is a two track or

979
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,799
kind of a two whatever

980
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,640
you know talk here i'm actually going to

981
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,159
go through some paramedic lessons

982
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:50,559
learned

983
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,240
for those that don't know that was

984
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,480
actually my first job right so way way

985
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,279
back in the day

986
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,960
it turns out there are actually a lot of

987
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
paramedics in security and incident

988
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,919

just like lists of folks that have been

998
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,679
in first response

999
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,919
uh first responder search and rescue

1000
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:20,720
that kind of

1001
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,399
those kind of scenarios like i even have

1002
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,760
the tattoo you know

1003
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,320
like the uh yeah for the good old

1004
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,600
paramedic days and

1005
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,320
anyway um so paramedic lessons learned

1006
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,799
right

1007
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,760
um so this stuff by the way i threw

1008
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,360
together this morning because this was

1009
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,720
totally impromptu

1010
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,320
that i was going to give a talk this

1011
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,559
morning and rock on

1012
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,039
game on we're here um but lesson learned

1013
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,799
number one your personal safety matters

1014
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,600
most

1015
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,000
you cannot help a patient uh or anybody

1016
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,360
else for that matter if you get hurt

1017
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,960
yourself and these are life lessons by

1018
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,640
the way i want to clarify too

1019
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,399
um while i'm going to talk in the

1020
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,240
context of paramedic you know an

1021
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,720
emergency response and the whole

1022
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,600
in crisis response uh this stuff applies

1023
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,360
unilaterally right so your personal

1024
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,200
safety matters most you have to stay in

1025
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,159
the game and so

1026
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,080
you know the way i transition this to

1027
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,760
incident response is

1028
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,120
get sleep right because if you don't

1029
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,840
sleep

1030
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,279
and if you fall out of the game if

1031
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,880
you're so critical that you can't go

1032
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,279
home

1033
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,679
you gotta work 23 hours a day right by

1034
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,200
the way it drives you nuts every time

1035
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,480
they have a white house press briefing

1036
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,080
over the last couple weeks

1037
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,720
he's working 24 hours a day he's getting

1038
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,559
like no sleep and i'm like god please

1039
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,279
get sleep

1040
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,279
you need sleep right kind of thing

1041
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,880
bottom line your personal safety matters

1042
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,679
most right

1043
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,200
you can't help a patient if you get hurt

1044
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,440
yourself um and you sure can't help the

1045
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,480
next patient and the next one on the

1046
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,360
next one

1047
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,960
and you're consuming more emergency

1048
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,640
resources if you get hurt yourself not

1049
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,120
only

1050
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,960
are you taking yourself out of the game

1051
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,880
right you and somebody that has to care

1052
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,000
for you too right

1053
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,880
you have to have to use personal safety

1054
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,080
first and i'm going to share a story

1055
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,720
here that

1056
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,320
i don't think i've ever shared publicly

1057
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,240
before but i'm going to anyway

1058
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,880
um my mom used to be a paramedic as well

1059
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,279
while

1060
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,519
she was a cardiac attack uh virginia

1061
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,399
that's an emti

1062
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,480
for those that uh you know are outside

1063
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,519
of virginia

1064
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,440
and know virginia's got a weird

1065
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,360
licensing model um anyway

1066
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,919
uh so uh but we used we used to uh roll

1067
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:12,480
together

1068
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,799
in the buckhannon uh emergency rescue

1069
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,600
squad there

1070
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,399
uh buchanan ems and uh we rolled out and

1071
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,120
my mom

1072
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,279
has three boys i'm the oldest of three

1073
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,519
and uh she's got a soft spot for a

1074
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,760
soft spot for boys and uh this kid took

1075
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,880
his car out

1076
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,640
and his parents of uh his parents were

1077
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,000
actually gone

1078
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,559
uh getting uh basically driving down to

1079
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,559
greensboro to buy him a car

1080
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,960
and bring it back for him and uh he took

1081
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,919
their car out

1082
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,159
on one of these windy roads wasn't you

1083
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,360
know speeding around

1084
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,519
on a 16th birthday wasn't wearing a

1085
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,679
seatbelt uh or may not bend exactly his

1086
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:46,960
birthday whatever but like

1087
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,480
wasn't wearing a seatbelt gets ejected

1088
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,559
from the vehicle um swerves to miss a

1089
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,080
deer hits the bank it's ejected from the

1090
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,440
vehicle he's pinned

1091
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,960
or at least partially pinned under the

1092
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,480
vehicle and

1093
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,640
uh i rolled the crash truck my mom

1094
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,760
rolled the uh

1095
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,760
rolled the ambulance um actually one of

1096
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,440
my brothers with one of my brothers i

1097
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,360
was also an emt

1098
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,320
and i it was the last call i ever ran

1099
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
with my mom i just thought i i can't i

1100
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,000
can't ever run a call with you again

1101
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,039
um because i i put an airbag if you're

1102
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,320
not familiar with these these are these

1103
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,080
basically help you lift a vehicle

1104
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,640
uh or can lift move whatever they are

1105
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
very powerful airbag so the compressor

1106
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,159
air power is phenomenal

1107
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,519
um and uh put an airbag and and i i had

1108
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,600
unpinned the uh person but but you need

1109
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,200
cribbing right because that airbag can

1110
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,679
pop

1111
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,760
the compressor can this the valve

1112
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,120
there's all kinds of stuff that could go

1113
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,799
wrong and so every crash truck has

1114
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,159
cribbing with it um

1115
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,760
and cribbing is is basically lots of

1116
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,440
lumber that you use to go pin stuff

1117
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,480
and you know get stuff in place and and

1118
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,519
she

1119
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,240
literally like dove into this ditch and

1120
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,080
dragged this kid back out from under

1121
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,720
without

1122
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,880
and i'm horrified i mean i just was

1123
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,240
horrified and

1124
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,320
and i i then realizing this kid needed

1125
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,919
airlift because we're an hour from i

1126
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,600
mean almost an hour from the hospital

1127
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
45 minutes from hospital at that point

1128
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,640
um

1129
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,399
i i moved to the local high school like

1130
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,799
i redeployed uh to the high school and

1131
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,480
set up the landing zone for the uh for

1132
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,440
the life flight

1133
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,760
um and uh and all that got got them you

1134
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,359
know coming in and my mom you know rolls

1135
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,480
in afterwards and

1136
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,320
and uh just i mean the kid died the next

1137
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,679
day anyway there was not

1138
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,199
realistically i think we kind of knew

1139
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,320
that that was that was going to be the

1140
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,719
case

1141
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,480
um just just based on you know his

1142
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,839
condition but um

1143
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,520
i told her then and we never ran a call

1144
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,359
together again um because

1145
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,520
i i can't i mean like there's this is

1146
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,040
always important but when it's family

1147
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,760
it's it's just

1148
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,199
it's critical important right it's your

1149
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,960
personal safety matters the most

1150
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,399
um always be calm even when you don't

1151
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,480
want to be always be calm

1152
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,399
right and uh this is something that i'm

1153
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,239
having to practice with my kid right now

1154
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,159
um you know is to be calm even when you

1155
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,679
don't want to be put a brave face on

1156
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,199
stuff even when you don't want you know

1157
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,399
even when you don't want to

1158
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,000
when you freak out so do your patients

1159
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,760
right if you've got kids if you've got

1160
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,520
significant others if you've got

1161
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,839
whatever it is around you right um

1162
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:56,719

1163
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,800
to be calm right you just have to be

1164
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,720
right put that brave face on stuff

by all means right uh and and and look

1171
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
that's fine that that's okay

1172
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,560
right even when you feel like freaking

1173
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,800
out though don't put a brave face on it

1174
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,720
and and go do that another time right

1175
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,480
that's that's just the reality of how it

1176
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,520
works right so

1177
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,040
uh when you freak out so do the people

1178
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,960
around you they're going to read your

1179
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,480
body language they're going to read what

1180
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,079
you're what you're doing what you're

1181
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,240
the way you're acting you gotta you

1182
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,440
gotta do it right so

1183
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,920
anyway it's never as bad as it looks

1184
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,440
right this is the uh this is another big

1185
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,960
one for me it's never as bad as it looks

1186
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,520
okay

1187
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,240
sometimes it actually is right um i i

1188
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,440
have countless like

1189
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,079
gore or whatever stories um you know

1190
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:44,800
here and

1191
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,720
but i'm just gonna tell you like uh you

1192
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,000
can't let the patient know that all

1193
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,560
right so

1194
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,680
even you know and again this kind of

1195
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,839
pivots off of off a number two always

1196
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,040
remain calm right

1197
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,960
but but the reality is you are gonna

1198
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,800
have time to decompress later

1199
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,359
um you know this this too shall pass um

1200
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,800
you just put one foot in front of the

1201
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,920
other and you keep

1202
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,079
right on moving and that's that's that's

1203
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:04,960
just it right

1204
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,640
uh put one front one foot in front of

1205
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,560
the other uh keep on moving i'll tell

1206
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,480
you that my military experience

1207
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,200
really helped with that you know i i i

1208
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,880
can tell you for sure i know exactly

1209
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,079
where my breaking point is

1210
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,119
um because uh they they

1211
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,520
took me right to it uh intentionally so

1212
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,400
right there's

1213
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,000
the there are folks in different

1214
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,720
programs um that uh the the whole

1215
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,560
purpose of the program is is to

1216
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,119
push you farther than than than you

1217
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,320
believe is possible

1218
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,280
um and i'll just say uh you know there's

1219
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,720
know where your breaking point is at or

1220
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,440
at least nowhere

1221
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,599
where if you don't know where break is

1222
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,680
at least know where

1223
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,280
know where the furthest you've ever been

1224
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,200
is all right and uh just just be ready

1225
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,560
to roll to that and and

1226
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,240
and use that as use it as an anchor be

1227
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,760
like yep this sucks but

1228
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,240
it wasn't as bad as that right um yep

1229
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,000
this is bad but it wasn't as bad as that

1230
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,520
story i heard this other time yeah this

1231
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,119
is bad but it wasn't as bad as

1232
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,880
and keep right on rolling right because

1233
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,920
again no matter how bad uh it looks now

1234
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,440
it's just not as bad as it looks sorry

1235
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,640
just keep putting one foot in front of

1236
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,440
the other

1237
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,960
do your thing and decompress later

1238
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
and and this one's important right this

1239
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
i think um and this is the last slide

1240
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,079
that i've got here and i might kick a

1241
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,680
couple of stories here if i've got time

1242
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,680
or answer questions or whatever

1243
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,680

you confirm my slides are showing

1249

cool uh so full screen there that may be

1258
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,040

okay all right um you know there

1267
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,520
you know there there are times you're

1268
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,880
going to see and experience

1269
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,560

certainly as a paramedic i i saw and

1271

experience stuff that that i'm just

1272
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:10,640
going to

1273
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,040
you know say nobody should have to see

1274
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,480
and endure things that nobody should

1275
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,280
have to endure

1276
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,760
right and over time it eats away at

1277
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,480
everybody

1278
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,079
and there are people in here who are

1279
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,760

1332
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,160
you know to kind of close out with and

1333
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
just say like um you know

1334
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,760
if you're okay today and you're like

1335
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,520
yeah i don't i don't need this right

1336
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,359
um you do you totally do i i i was that

1337
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:07,760
guy

1338
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,680
right and and maybe this is life life

1339
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,359
lessons but like you know i was

1340
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,520
certified as an emt at 16 paramedic at

1341
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,319
18

1342
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,760
and uh i i i thought

1343
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,440
cause you know your prefrontal cortex

1344
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,880
isn't isn't fully

1345
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,480
fully developed there right i was like

1346
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,000
oh yeah not me not me

1347
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,760
that's that's stuff other people need

1348
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,359
right to talk to a counselor right that

1349
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,720
other people need to

1350
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,119
you get it get it today find find that

1351
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,560
support network today

1352
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,160
before you need it right because when

1353
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,079
you need it i speak from experience here

1354
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,839
because i didn't find one until i needed

1355
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,520
it um and and i was

1356
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,240
so far overboard with needing it that uh

1357
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,880
i

1358
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,359
yeah um i i was in a pretty dark place

1359
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,240
and uh

1360
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,839
everything that i'd bottled up right

1361
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,760
just just hit it once and uh that that's

1362
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,599
not where you want to be right and so

1363
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,079
um you know yeah find somebody to talk

1364
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,839
to know that it's okay not to be okay

1365
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,359
um you know i know earlier i was like

1366
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,960
put a brave face on things

1367
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,560
and that that's that's for family that's

1368
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,079
for patient that's for

1369
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,319
right um your family by the way probably

1370
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,760
is not who you want to use as a support

1371
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,880
network i'm just going to throw that out

1372
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,920
there right because that's that's where

1373
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,520
the brave face needs to be

1374
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,440
um you know my personal opinion right

1375
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,960
but the uh you know if i find that

1376
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,240
support network where there's somebody

1377
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,440
you can talk to and just be like yeah

1378
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:15,760
dude

1379
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,480
i i i need to chat i need to i need to

1380
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,160
vent i need to get this out whatever

1381
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,520
right um so anyway um look uh this

1382
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,800
conclusion slide obviously doesn't

1383
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,480
include any paramedic stuff um it's

1384
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,839
don't reinvent the wheel with cti

1385
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:28,960
analysis uh

1386
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,880
you know because we talk about cti and

1387
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
intelligence analysis

1388
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,160
cti analysts can make the same use of

1389
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,760
cancer analytic doctrine the traditional

1390
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,480
cti

1391
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,760
or traditional intelligence analysts

1392
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,160
have for decades and adopting nine or

1393
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,280
even just four right

1394
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,880
uh of those steps in the doctrine are

1395
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,720
gonna help cti teams perform with more

1396
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,040
consistent analysis those top four again

1397
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,640
um were basically focused on policymaker

1398
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,280
concerns

1399
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,079
right that was number one number four is

1400
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,480
the uh avoid uh conscious analytic

1401
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,720
conscious avoidance of analytic biases

1402
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,720
uh number six was systematic use of

1403
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,160
outside experts and number nine was the

1404
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,000
mia called them right or the

1405
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,440
more more appropriately the candidate

1406
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,520
mission of mistakes let people know when

1407
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,720
you've made a mistake and you can

1408
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,079
typically it's not your fault right if

1409
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,440
you've done good analysis if you've

1410
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,880
applied the models correctly

1411
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,800
it's not your fault it's it's just the

1412
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,880
lay of the land it's the way this stuff

1413
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,359
just the way this stuff works right um

1414
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:19,920
so

1415
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,240
i'll say one more um you know less uh

1416
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,000
you know as far as like the

1417
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
uh you know put a brave face or always

1418
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,599

yep so uh um checking some of the

1487
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,560
questions

and i think from the only one is

1489
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,599
uh folks were wondering if rendition

security uh

1491
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,319
edition infosec is hiring um

1492
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,520
well uh we we are uh how about at the

1493
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,040
moment we're cautious uh

1494
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,079
because you know we don't know what's

1495
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,000
happening with the economy right now um

1496
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,760
but uh we're still closing you know me

1497
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,960
and john strand we're talking about this

1498
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,960
in pre-show we're all still closing work

1499
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,000
um i guess the short of it is uh

1500
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,480
by all means submit a resume um but uh i

1501
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,040
i

1502
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,800
just to be straight up honest i i don't

1503
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,400
think i'm holding the trigger on the

1504
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,440
majority of

1505
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,480
folks we have in the pipeline now um and

1506
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,520
the majority of folks we have in the

1507
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,079
pipeline

1508
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,359
i see a question that just came in can

1509
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:24,720
you give an example of an analytical

1510
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,480
model or an analytic model

1511
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,920
um and yeah totally uh so

1512
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,920
um yeah somebody asked about group chat

1513
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,200
how do you make the group chat visible

1514
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,079
get on slack

1515
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,520
that's where to be for to see

1516
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,040
everybody's questions uh only the

1517
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,560
organizers can see the questions it's

1518
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,520
just it's a weird

1519
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,760
it's a weird setup with go to webinar um

1520
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,960
so

1521
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,640
anyway um can i give an example of an

1522
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,079
analytic model yeah totally

1523
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,960
um i mentioned uh you know richard hoyer

1524
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,520
um

1525
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,200
has the psychology of intelligence

1526
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,560
analysis right so

1527
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,119
so definitely that's a big one and here

1528
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,720
because you just can't make this up i'm

1529
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,000
like looking at

1530
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,440
looking at this book this is another

1531
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,599
outstanding one um from clark

1532
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,760
right like it's actually sitting on my

1533
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,839
desk right like and you can see kind of

1534
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:06,960
well worn in the

1535
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,280
you know there but uh uh well like so

1536
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,640
well worn that it's like tearing on the

1537
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,119
cover

1538
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,880
um but uh target-centric approach

1539
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,400
intelligence analysis has a lot of

1540
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:14,960
models

1541
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,800
i wouldn't start with this one i really

1542
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,480
like foyer's books better because it

1543
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,400
breaks it down on what they call sats

1544
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,640
or structured analytic techniques right

1545
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,920
you have to use them all

1546
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,160
one of them that's a great uh that's

1547
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,520
such a great one here

1548
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,920
um is or i think is a great one um is uh

1549
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,520
ach i mentioned in the slides that's

1550
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,440
analysis of competing hypotheses it's a

1551
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,640
little bit longer but

1552
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,400
i also like decision matries that's

1553
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,599
another one covered another structural

1554
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:40,720
analytic technique

1555
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,200
um but yeah those are all good examples

1556
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,720
of analytic models and by the way

1557
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,880
applying kent's analog doctrine itself

1558
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,560
is a model right if you say these are

1559
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,560
nine things that we consciously do

1560
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,800
right nine steps that we take not only

1561
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,720
steps we take but all of our analysis

1562
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,319
adheres to these principles

1563
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,040
that's a model right so that's what what

1564
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,640
i mean when i talk about models

1565
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,319
right so anyway

1566
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,839
is our next speaker here yep the next

1567

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,480
write a list of books for beginners or

1580
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,200
the slides
