1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
all right let's kick off

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,520
hello everybody this is going to be a

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,240
really

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,760
interesting and hopefully intersecting

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,480
two-part talk here at pancakes con

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,360
about using jupiter notebooks and

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,560
information security

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,760
contexts as well as using elbows

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,000
in your self-defense arsenal and since

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,640
we're all self-isolating

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,519
to also increase your physical fitness

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,080
in a

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,199
small amount of space let's

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,079
get going

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,840
so up first um i want to tell you a

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,600
little bit about myself just so we're

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
all acquainted my name is michael

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,879
taggart as corinne said

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,480
i am coming most of my career was spent

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,079
in k-12 education as a tech director

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,320
and computer science instructor and

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,399
about two years ago i made the switch

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,559
over to infosec and this is actually my

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,239
first con talk so i'm really really

25
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,239
excited to be here

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,520
i am now a security analyst and i work

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,119
in the healthcare sector

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,119
i am a self-taught programmer i'm

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,360
self-taught everything i.t

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,119
i started life as an english major but i

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,560
think a lot of us took

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,119
kind of circuitous routes into infosec

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:19,600
it's

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,720
kind of why i love it here and

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
i've been a lifelong martial artist and

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,840
we'll talk a little bit more about what

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,439
i've done in the martial arts when we

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,040
get to that section

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,360
i love aviation i love star trek you

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,200
know your general kind of nerd

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,680
uh since arriving infosec i really feel

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,479
like i've

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,119
found my tribe

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,280
in fact i need to take a second before i

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,640
go any further to

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,520
specifically thank leslie carhart uh she

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,479
doesn't know i'm doing this

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,759
but um it was her generous gift of a

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,200
ticket to hope

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,280
in new york in 2018 that actually

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,439
inspired my passion

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,960
for infosec and convinced me to pivot my

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,240
career in this direction

54
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,040
and so in many many ways i would not be

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,840
here giving this talk if not for leslie

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,080
so some context before we get started

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,599
um i'm glad that this talk is actually

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,080
coming

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,560
after jared's talk talking about

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,080
computer programming

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,000
in order to use jupiter because it's

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,599
built on python

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,319
and other programming languages it does

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,080
require a little bit of computer

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,599
programming experience to really

66
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,959
understand what's going on

67
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,480
so these two talks are related

68
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,840
um what jupiter broadly speaking

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,400
is an interface for literate programming

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,920
and what that means is that

71
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,640
there is written text that is meant for

72
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,120
human

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,319
consumption interspersed with executable

74
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,200
code

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,280
and we'll ex we'll see more of what that

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,800
looks like when we jump into the jupiter

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,440
notebooks

78
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,879
but i want to take a second to talk

79
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,560
about literate programming itself and

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,920
what that means

81
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
donald knuth who wrote the book he

82
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,440
literally wrote the book the art of

83
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,959
computer programming

84
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,800
talked about literate programming

85
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,480
um and what he meant he wrote this in

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,159
the 90s way after he did the art

87
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,840
the first version the first edition of

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,200
the art of computer programming

89
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
what he meant by literate programming is

90
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,720
that the bulk of

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
a computer program should actually be

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,879
intended not for machine consumption

93
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,200
but for human consumption and so if you

94
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,640
think about it almost like

95
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,159
a logical proof or a philosophical essay

96
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,280
most of the body of the program

97
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,480
is actually supposed to be for humans

98
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,920
and you're explaining the rationale for

99
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,640
what you're doing

100
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,920
and then interspersed with that you

101
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,680
would actually have the machine code

102
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
for what were what we're trying to

103
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,720
accomplish with the

104
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,440
with the program jupiter makes this

105
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:51,920
really

106
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,720
accessible as a concept and puts it into

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,840
practice

108
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,640
jupiter's found a really really

109
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,760
comfortable niche

110
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,680
inside of machine learning and ai

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
as well as data science for at large

112
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
sociology epidemiology

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,239
kind of topical

114
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,640
and let me throw up my webcam right

115
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,160
quick

116
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,560
there we go here i am

117
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,880
uh okay so

118
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
um

119
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,880
all right hopefully everybody can still

120
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120
see

121
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,479
what's going on okay cool um

122
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,000
so jupiter started as ipython

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,080
and it was built originally in python

124
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,000
but it doesn't have to be

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,919
based in python jupiter now supports

126
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,120
multiple kernels

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,040
so if you're familiar with node.js you

128
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,560
can use node if you're familiar with

129
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,479
haskell you can use haskell

130
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,080
if you're familiar with scheme you can

131
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,520
use scheme i think there's a c-sharp

132
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,720
kernel as well so

133
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,199
really if you have a pet programming

134
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,479
language that you like

135
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,400
it's definitely available

136
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,120
oh interesting slides aren't changing

137
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,320
well in that case let's see if we can

138
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,840
switch over to a different window

139
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
hey if your slides aren't changing the

140
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,919
best thing to do

141
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,039
is stop sharing and then start sharing

142
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:35,440
again

143
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,479
and then it should take off okay i just

144
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,199
did and

145
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,240
let's see if that helped

146
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,520
for folks

147
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
are they actually progressing on your

148
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,600
system are they not even progressing on

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,320
your system

150
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,840
no they are definitely progressing on my

151
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,600
system okay so just take us out of

152
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,560
presenter mode

153
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,639
and just be like in the standard mode

154
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,000
and we'll just go through that way it's

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,280
probably the best just to get through it

156
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,600
looks like folks are seeing it now

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
okay there you go all right cool sorry

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,919
about that everybody

159
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,199
um okay cool so let me know again if it

160
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,560
doesn't change i am keeping an eye on

161
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,280
slack just to see

162
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,479
all right so why is jupiter

163
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,680
why do i think jupiter is really

164
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,120
important for infosec other than my own

165
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,560
personal experience

166
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,880
one of the things that jupiter does for

167
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,560
us as a team

168
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,280
a security team a dfir team whatever we

169
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,160
are

170
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,240
is that it can unify our procedures

171
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,759
around a single skill set

172
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,800
which is python

173
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,120
sometimes you need a sim and sometimes

174
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,400
you don't and

175
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,160
what i mean by that is that we have a

176
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,919
lot of data coming in ideally and

177
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,080
processing it and analyzing it

178
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,840
is often the job of these enterprise

179
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,360
applications we

180
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,120
our organization may have it our

181
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,080
organization may not

182
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,240
but with jupiter as an open source tool

183
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,919
we have the ability to

184
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,960
do serious data analysis without the

185
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,919
overhead of

186
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,240
a full sim if we can't afford it or if

187
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,599
whatever reason the data isn't going

188
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,160
into us

189
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,240
sim i know that never happens right we

190
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,919
all of our end points are reporting to

191
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,560
our sense right

192
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
but if there is a situation where they

193
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
aren't and we do have access to the logs

194
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,400
another way we can use this tool to

195
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,479
analyze the data so that we can do

196
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,680
threat analysis

197
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,919
um and identification and

198
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,840
a lot of my day-to-day is about threat

199
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,520
hunting um and also

200
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,880
security analysis but any

201
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,039
if python can do it jupiter can do it

202
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,639
and so why that's really valuable is

203
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,720
your application that you write in a

204
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
jupiter notebook is self-documenting and

205
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,160
i don't just mean because of code

206
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,960
comments

207
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,680
i mean that because you can intersperse

208
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,840
text which is formatted in markdown

209
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
along with your executable code your

210
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,360
runbook can actually

211
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,560
run and so your whole library of

212
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,280
procedures

213
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,919
can be stored in jupyter notebooks and

214
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,759
executed by members of the team who all

215
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,240
have

216
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,639
this same shared skill set

217
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,720
all right so hopefully i've sold you on

218
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,479
the potential value of jupiter how do we

219
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,199
get started

220
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,879
because it's based in python you want to

221
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,599
make sure that on your system python 3.6

222
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,319
or above

223
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,360
is installed with the pip

224
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,720
package manager you can go to python.org

225
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,679
to grab it if you don't if you don't

226
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,519
have it on your system

227
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,839
and then you're going to use pip to

228
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,599
install jupyter lab

229
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,120
and then you open the interface in the

230
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,599
browser

231
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,800
i've also put together a git repository

232
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
with some starter information and the

233
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,920
two notebooks that we're going to be

234
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,880
talking about

235
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,200
in this presentation so if you want to

236
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,240
go ahead and grab that

237
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,839
feel free to follow along

238
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,079
we'll start with some jupiter basics and

239
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,000
we'll start with some jupiter basics and

240
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,279
uh go through

241
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,480
what a notebook looks like

242
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,040
i'm going to exit out of my

243
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,880
presentation here and switch over to a

244
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
different window hopefully you guys can

245
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,399
see this as it comes up

246
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,440
all right folks are we seeing the uh

247
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,959
the browser view great

248
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,760
that's what we need uh my python shirt

249
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,959
is actually out of view but there we go

250
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,120
thanks emily so this is the

251
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,800
link for our git repository if you want

252
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,040
to follow along

253
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,640
and i should point out that i am using

254
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,720
in our demonstration today some of the

255
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,320
data from the splunk from the splunk

256
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,440
tutorial data

257
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,920
so what we're doing we're doing with

258
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,560
data that

259
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,399
otherwise splunk would be using but we

260
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,040
can do it with this as well

261
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,560
all right so i'm going to hop over to

262
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,720
jupyter lab here

263
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,200
i have jupyter lab running in my browser

264
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,079
this is what happens

265
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,600
after we run jupyter lab in the folder

266
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,959
that we want to fire up the lab

267
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,320
environment

268
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,120
and this is the interface that we get

269
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,200
just taking a quick tour around what do

270
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,040
we have well we have a file browser on

271
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,760
the left

272
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,920
and then we'll get a launcher window

273
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
right here and we can start different

274
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,240
notebooks with different kernels now i

275
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,640
only have the python 3 kernel installed

276
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,800
but if you have other kernels installed

277
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,839
like scheme

278
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,000
or haskell or node.js or whatever

279
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,880
powershell

280
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,680
um you'll see them here so you'll be

281
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,200
able to launch notebooks with different

282
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,120
kernels right from this interface

283
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,360
you can see also that it has a built-in

284
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,399
shell you can

285
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,480
do a text editor markdown file whatever

286
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,240
else you need so it's a really nice

287
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,360
all-in-one environment

288
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,800
let's take a look at our first intro

289
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
notebook here

290
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,480
so the most important concept in jupyter

291
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,120
notebooks

292
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,120
is that our document is separated into

293
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,399
cells a cell is

294
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,680
a section of text or code by double

295
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,959
clicking on this first cell you can see

296
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,600
that this is formatted into markdown

297
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,240
right and anything you can do in

298
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,959
markdown you can do here

299
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,320
when i run the selected cell by either

300
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,360
clicking the play button

301
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,800
or typing control enter it executes the

302
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,440
cell

303
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,279
now executing a markdown cell means

304
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,720
formatting it right and showing the

305
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,839
resulting html

306
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,519
executing a python cell

307
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,000
will execute the code so if we run this

308
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,720
one

309
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,160
we'll get the output right here

310
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,839
another really really cool capability of

311
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,680
jupyter which is actually above and

312
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,000
beyond what even python can do easily

313
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,200
is interaction with the shell so

314
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,920
right here i'm using the exclamation

315
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,040
point

316
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,480
macro and then using an ls command

317
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,279
with the ww1 folder and i'm assigning

318
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,440
the result of that to the files variable

319
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:25,760
so

320
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,120
on the left hand side of the exclamation

321
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,639
point

322
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,320
that is uh that's python and then on the

323
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,360
right-hand side that's bash

324
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,880
so if i run this

325
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,920
you'll see that i get the contents of

326
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,000
that file of that folder inside of a

327
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
list

328
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,600
the other thing we can do uh that's

329
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,440
really really helpful inside of jupiter

330
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,000
is we can

331
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,880
use the input command inside of python

332
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,279
to

333
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,800
ask for data from the user

334
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,240
people are asking to zoom in so i shall

335
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,839
hopefully that helps

336
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,320
so with uh input

337
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,000
we have the ability to get information

338
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,839
during runtime

339
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,519
all right we'll zoom in a little bit

340
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,760
more

341
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,760
make sure everybody can read it so what

342
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,040
we have here

343
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,000
is the ability to get input during

344
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,639
runtime

345
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,120
why that matters is let's say that

346
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,959
you're interacting with an api

347
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,560
or you're act interacting with some sort

348
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,000
of sensitive process you don't want to

349
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,279
store secrets

350
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,680
in the jupyter notebook right um even if

351
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,519
it's a private repository or anything

352
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,399
so what you can do is ask for those

353
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,279
credentials

354
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,399
at runtime and then run your notebook as

355
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,959
necessary

356
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,880
so let's run this cell and just see what

357
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,639
happens

358
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,839
i'm going to put in my name

359
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,639
so a couple of things are going to

360
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,279
happen here the first is i'm getting the

361
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,000
input i'm getting my name and then i'm

362
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,880
assigning

363
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,480
the result to a string that is

364
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,440
my name uh inside of the hello world

365
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,320
string

366
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,680
right and

367
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,800
i'm doing this a little bit different

368
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,959
than jared showed i'm using the format

369
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:43,440
of

370
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,680
method inside of python which just

371
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,480
inserts

372
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,920
the name here inside of these curlies

373
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,959
now i'm printing to the notebook itself

374
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,120
but notice the other thing i'm doing i'm

375
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,360
using the exclamation point so i'm using

376
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,199
shell commands right from here

377
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,519
and then i'm sending it right with the

378
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,800
output redirection

379
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,440
to message.txt and if you were watching

380
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,079
carefully

381
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,079
you'll notice that over on the left hand

382
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,199
side

383
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,279
i have a new file in my folder right i

384
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,440
have message.txt

385
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,720
which i can just open here so if i

386
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,000
if i need to save output from commands

387
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,600
i can send them from python to the shell

388
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,160
with basic unix shell commands

389
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,600
and vice versa if i am able to format

390
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,040
text let's say i'm using cut or

391
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,160
you know set or awk or something to

392
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,240
take a text file and reformat it in a

393
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,160
saner way i can get that information

394
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
directly into python without having to

395
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,800
do you know

396
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,240
input file streaming or anything like

397
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
that i can just get it assigned to a

398
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,000
variable using that exclamation point

399
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,959
macro

400
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,560
right so

401
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,199
the next notebook i'm going to show you

402
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,560
is admittedly

403
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,600
a lot okay um because of the compressed

404
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,199
time i thought it was valuable to go

405
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:07,680
through

406
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,160
kind of a real world application of this

407
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,720
but

408
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,160
it's going to be a lot so i encourage

409
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,440
you if you're really interested in this

410
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,199
to dive in and see what we're doing but

411
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,320
what we're going to do in the next

412
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,279
notebook

413
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,480
is go through log analysis with

414
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,920
jupiter and the logs we're going to be

415
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,680
reviewing are the logs

416
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,079
from the splunk tutorial data so this is

417
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,759
real stuff that splunk otherwise would

418
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,079
be using but we can use jupyter to do it

419
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,638
for free

420
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,480
okay so there are a couple of libraries

421
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,839
just like jared was talking about

422
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,920
earlier we use external libraries to

423
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,199
augment our uh

424
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,720
capabilities inside of a programming

425
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,480
language we are

426
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,600
using um

427
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,800
pandas which right here

428
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,240
is a very very popular data science

429
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,440
library for python pandas

430
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,920
big takeaway for pandas is that it

431
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,199
allows us to create

432
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,079
tabular data objects called data frames

433
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,359
kind of like spreadsheets but with a

434
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,559
little bit more juice

435
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,640
that we can use for data analysis and

436
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,480
these data frame objects have a lot of

437
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,319
built-in analysis tools and even

438
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,919
visualization tools

439
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,160
so if we can get our data into a tabular

440
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,799
form get it into a pandas data frame

441
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,439
we're golden

442
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,199
we're also using the venerable

443
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,640
matplotlib

444
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,200
which is kind of the open source version

445
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,559
of matlab if any of you had to use

446
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,720
matlab in school

447
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,039
to do some of our plotting now pandas

448
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,400
uses

449
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,799
pi plot part of matplotlib anyway but

450
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,919
sometimes you want to just use it by

451
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:46,799
itself

452
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,360
for for more customization of your

453
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,559
graphs

454
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,480
and then another library i really like

455
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,000
is seabourn

456
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,679
and seaborne is just a very

457
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,640
very ergonomic data visualization tool

458
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,640
so if we take a look here

459
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,080
at the gallery you can see that there's

460
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,080
kind of an amazing amount

461
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,640
that you can do with seaborne just with

462
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,679
tabular data

463
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,600
and it's actually designed to work with

464
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,120
pandas so

465
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,959
definitely recommend checking these out

466
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,880
so what we're doing in this notebook is

467
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,200
we're

468
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,240
we're looking at the access log from a

469
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,919
web server and we're also looking at the

470
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,520
security log from the server

471
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,760
and seeing what's going on between the

472
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,280
two

473
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,919
now because i don't know if any of you

474
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,440
have ever looked at access logs but

475
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
let's look at one right now right you

476
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,760
can see here i'm taking the first

477
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,600
entry from both the access log and the

478
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,280
secure log just raw

479
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,720
and it's just text right it's

480
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,480
unstructured and they're not even the

481
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:56,960
same

482
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,440
so we have to do a little bit of leg

483
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,400
work to

484
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,799
break this down into tabular data now

485
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,240
some of you command line ninjas out

486
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,640
there

487
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,039
can probably use uh cut and set and off

488
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:07,760
to just like

489
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,600
turn this into a c csv right away um

490
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,880
totally you can do that i have found

491
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,919
that often

492
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,919
it's easier for me to

493
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,160
uh to use a regular expressions when

494
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,440
possible i know that that can be a

495
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,799
little bit tricky

496
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,640
to build up the data frame piece by

497
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,960
piece

498
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,280
um some folks in the chat are talking

499
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,720
about bro and zeke

500
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,080
and it's very funny because i was

501
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,240
actually attending the the

502
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,919
the security onion training with with

503
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,559
zeke last week at wwhf

504
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,600
and um this is a great tool to augment

505
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,080
all of that stuff

506
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,360
and it doesn't necessarily replace it

507
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,360
because and especially rita that john

508
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,799
was talking about earlier

509
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,080
right this can do some of the same

510
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,160
statistical analysis but

511
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,760
again i would recommend using it to

512
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,480
augment some of these other tools

513
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,760
but what we're doing here is we're

514
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,520
building up the data frame piece by

515
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,159
piece

516
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,640
right and you can see that just by

517
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,200
getting the raw data into a column

518
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,919
called raw we get a shape for each one

519
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,600
and this is number of rows and number of

520
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,080
columns so you can see that our access

521
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,919
log has thirteen thousand some entries

522
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,440
our secure log has ten thousand some

523
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,320
entries

524
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,640
so um they're not quite the same length

525
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,000
and we don't know that they're related

526
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,400
yet

527
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,919
right we still have a lot more work to

528
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,440
do but we do know that we have a bunch

529
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,039
of data which is good because the more

530
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,799
data means that if we do statistical

531
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,400
analysis

532
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,679
we're more confident in our results

533
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,600
the head method will take just the first

534
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,440
five rows and show you what you're

535
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,600
looking at and you can see that

536
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,760
we're indexed by integer and then this

537
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,880
is just the raw text

538
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,159
with the column name of raw

539
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,760
if i want to break this down

540
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,280
i can use the bracket method to access

541
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,480
specific columns

542
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,760
of a data frame which is what you're

543
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,320
seeing here but i need to make more

544
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,960
columns

545
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,640
i need to turn this into ip addresses

546
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,360
and users and timestamps and all of this

547
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,960
stuff so how do i do that

548
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,799
well in this case we took a look at what

549
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,080
was common across

550
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,919
the log entries and how they were

551
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,360
structured and

552
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,400
for the ip address right what we did was

553
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,320
we're creating a new column on the

554
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,799
access log data frame and the secure log

555
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,000
data frame

556
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,720
and we're just using the dot the

557
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,799
built-in dot str

558
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,480
methods in pandas to extract

559
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,120
things that match a regular expression

560
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,000
regular expression

561
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,159
gurus out there it's the capture group

562
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,039
that we're after

563
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,960
right here so anything that's caught in

564
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,480
that capture group is what's going to be

565
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:50,960
added

566
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,039
to the new column and now you can see

567
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,440
in our data frame at this point now we

568
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,960
have an ip column

569
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,840
that matches what we want what's cool

570
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,360
about this is now that we can we can do

571
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,640
counts by ip

572
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,400
right we can do pie charts all sorts of

573
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,480
stuff

574
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,159
for time stamps similar process right um

575
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,559
we have to be pretty careful with our

576
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,440
string

577
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,640
but uh for the access log with secure we

578
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,480
don't because the timestamp is right up

579
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,000
at the front always

580
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,840
and because of the way they formatted it

581
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,919
it's of regular length so we can just

582
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:26,880
take

583
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,799
the first 25

584
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,879
yeah characters

585
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,799
and now we have our time stamps

586
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,440
here are a few other examples of columns

587
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,159
we can make

588
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,760
using the same sort of approach

589
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,960
again these are a lot so i recommend if

590
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,080
you're interested in this go ahead and

591
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,120
check them out and

592
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
if you find any mistakes please let me

593
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,159
know

594
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,480
i definitely don't claim to have this

595
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,280
100

596
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:09,120
down but it's been working for me so far

597
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,720
i want to take a quick second to talk

598
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,240
about indices

599
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,039
this is a special idea in pandas which

600
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,039
is

601
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,880
the way that the data is sorted and how

602
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,159
you access rows

603
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,840
by default when you make a new data

604
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,320
frame indices are just integers right

605
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,960
row 0

606
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,480
row 1 row 2. but you can make indices

607
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,120
out of other columns or other kinds of

608
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,840
data

609
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,000
and the most valuable usually is what we

610
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,080
call a date time index

611
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,640
and that that comes from taking that raw

612
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,200
string

613
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,840
of the timestamp and turning it into a

614
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,240
date

615
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,120
time object and then setting that uh the

616
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,279
series of daytime objects

617
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,200
as your index luckily

618
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,120
pandas has a built-in to datetime method

619
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,159
that allows us to take the timestamp

620
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,600
and if it is samely formatted as the

621
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,760
security log ones are

622
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,080
we can just infer the objects which

623
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,760
turns it into a string and then pass

624
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,480
that to

625
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,440
two daytime and now we have a time stamp

626
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,279
if they're a little bit wonkier the way

627
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,039
that the timestamps are in the access

628
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,400
log we can give it

629
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,039
a format string to tell it exactly how

630
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,600
to extract the data information

631
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,320
after that we have ourselves a datetime

632
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,960
index

633
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,279
which allows us to arrange things by

634
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,279
time

635
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,840
why does that matter well if we want to

636
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,840
view things chronologically imagine the

637
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
number of event events per second

638
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,919
right imagine that we are concerned

639
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,120
about a ddos attack

640
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
or a brute force right we're going to

641
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,720
see a jump by time

642
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,520
and now we can analyze that visually as

643
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,600
well as in a tabular method because we

644
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,719
have the datetime index

645
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,679
so sure enough as we go through the data

646
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,039
analysis and we

647
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,360
group by minutes you can see that here

648
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,200
our security everything happened in one

649
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,840
minute or at least one minute number

650
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,960
um whereas our access logs right we see

651
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,919
a lot more

652
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,080
uh minute counts right things happen at

653
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,000
minute zero minute one minute two now

654
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,919
this isn't as clear as we'd like it to

655
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,039
be

656
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,159
and for that reason we often wanna group

657
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,520
by multiple things

658
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,840
like hour minute uh by hour and minute

659
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,559
right and second so you can see this

660
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,360
happened

661
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,640
all at midnight at different seconds

662
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,919
this happened at 11 o'clock

663
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,520
but this is a really good example of

664
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,440
where tabular data might fail you and

665
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,640
you might want to consider

666
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,679
visual analysis so

667
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,159
with visual analysis right we can get

668
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,039
those counts

669
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,159
the same thing that we saw above

670
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,919
and using the built-in plot methods

671
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,960
we can get ourselves access events per

672
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,600
hour

673
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
now we grouped by hour for this kind of

674
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,240
resolution

675
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,159
um and you can see

676
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,440
that we actually started right at

677
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,880
midnight that there was a massive amount

678
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,400
and then we kind of jumped down so we'd

679
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,919
be really curious to see what was going

680
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:14,240
on

681
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,400
up here at the high point a good

682
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,679
question from the chat is

683
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,760
if time is your indices then what

684
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,360
happens when multiple events happen in

685
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,880
the same second

686
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,640
so what we're doing is we're aggregating

687
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,000
them and so

688
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,120
by by count so what we can do

689
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,279
is if we group by hour right you can see

690
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,880
how many happened per hour if you group

691
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,679
by a minute

692
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,000
um you can also just plot across a full

693
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,960
time index

694
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,400
and pandas are smart enough to kind of

695
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,240
put those things where they belong

696
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,840
so you can do this a bunch of different

697
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,279
ways depending on how you want to look

698
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,799
at your data

699
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,480
but creating a date time index just

700
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,919
means that you have the

701
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,080
actual time of the event available as a

702
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,840
way to reference the data

703
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,880
security was a little bit interesting

704
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,320
because we found out that all of them

705
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,480
happened at the same second

706
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,960
it was kind of wild and if we broke it

707
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,559
down even further it all happened like

708
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,600
at midnight

709
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,799
plus two so uh something was going on

710
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,960
there

711
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,279
i know i'm running a little bit short on

712
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,200
time for this section so i want to

713
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,240
quickly show you

714
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,799
that we have another couple of ways to

715
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,960
show things like a pie chart

716
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,799
what i've done here is i've taken the

717
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,000
top access ips so i've grouped my access

718
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,480
data

719
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,919
by ip grabbed the count which turns it

720
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,760
into a new data frame

721
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,600
i've sorted it by

722
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,679
the raw just to show the ip address

723
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,039
and then the ascending is false

724
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,320
what that means is i'm getting the top

725
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,840
five ips by

726
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,640
prompt and well head gives me the top

727
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,120
five

728
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,279
and then i'm plotting those with a pie

729
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,240
chart

730
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,559
so check that out i now see the share of

731
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,720
the damage done by my top five ips or

732
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,399
the top five access attempts by my top

733
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,399
five ips

734
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,039
so what could i do from here i could

735
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,480
throw these against

736
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,080
threat intelligence right see if any of

737
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,399
these are iocs i could throw these

738
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,440
against

739
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,080
my cmdb to see if these are things that

740
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,039
i know about

741
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,039
right and i can script all of this out

742
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,960
in my notebook as part of a

743
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,080
standard procedure that my team executes

744
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,039
so that i don't i don't miss anything in

745
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:27,840
the procedure

746
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,159
right the programmatic stuff is

747
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,760
automated because it's happening in the

748
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,320
code

749
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,760
and then the human stuff is happening

750
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
because i'm running the documentation as

751
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,200
a member of the team using this

752
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,080
standardized practice

753
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
same thing here for failed user accounts

754
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,120
i love this one

755
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
so we pulled out anything that had a

756
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,720
failure um

757
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,880
report in the security log and then we

758
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,480
grouped it by users

759
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,520
and then we did the top top ones and

760
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,200
then we found this chart

761
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,279
where we see who are the top user failed

762
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,640
logins right

763
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,320
that's a lot of admin that's a lot of

764
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
administrator this smells fishy to me

765
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,159
that smells like brute force

766
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,640
um i might be looking at the ips these

767
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,559
are coming from next i might be looking

768
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,080
at you know successful logins to see if

769
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,600
there was anything else going on there

770
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,279
at the same time

771
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,840
so it's a really great way of doing a

772
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,480
little bit

773
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,399
of threat hunting here and then as i

774
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,760
said we can we can

775
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,120
expand this by tying into external apis

776
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,600
you could tie into virustotal talos

777
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,640
other thread intel

778
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
or any other tools that expose apis in

779
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:40,720
your organization

780
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,039
all right

781
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,080
quick final thoughts on jupiter

782
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,279
uh let me just confirm from the chat

783
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,840
guys that you can still see my screen

784
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,360
cool how about now

785
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,840
rad okay

786
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,120
so final thoughts on jupiter um as i've

787
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
said it's a really powerful platform for

788
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,520
any

789
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,240
any area of infosec as long as the skill

790
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,360
set is around

791
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,159
in your team to use python that can be a

792
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,760
big ask depending on your team

793
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,760
but i think that the roi is pretty

794
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
pretty solid here

795
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,880
um and again because you can standardize

796
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,799
documentation and the actual procedure

797
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,480
inside of the same document

798
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,559
the potential for creating an

799
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,159
institutional memory of

800
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,559
known and executed procedures is really

801
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,320
really powerful so organizational value

802
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,279
all right got about

803
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,159
16 minutes or so to talk about elbow

804
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,120
strikes so i'm going to

805
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,320
pivot over to elbow room

806
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,519
so i'm a lifelong martial artist

807
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,880
and uh i started my martial arts career

808
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,720
in traditional chinese martial arts

809
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,320
northern gong fu tianshan pai

810
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,000
and then moved into some internal arts

811
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,600
like shingic and

812
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,120
taiji twin i know i'm butchering those

813
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,880
pronunciations i apologize

814
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,600
um kind of a strange northern art called

815
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,480
bhaji twin

816
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,679
which is uh baji is actually

817
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,360
eight extremes and so

818
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,039
much like muay thai which is often

819
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,480
called the science of eight limbs

820
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,799
it was a style that was about using not

821
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,159
just your your hands

822
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,279
and your feet but also the middling uh

823
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,000
joints right the elbows and the knees

824
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,120
and

825
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,640
i moved into krav maga i did some

826
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,799
western boxing and uh reality-based

827
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,320
self-defense of several different

828
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,960
flavors

829
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,880
and i've been an instructor in in

830
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,720
tcmancroft

831
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,320
so i've kind of been around the block

832
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,159
with martial arts but that being said

833
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,600
all of the stuff that i'm about to talk

834
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,519
about comes from a place of humility

835
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,120
i'm making no claims that these

836
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,960
techniques are the best or the most

837
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,679
effective

838
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,080
these are what work for me um everything

839
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,919
that i've showed you i've used in

840
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,640
uh drill simulations and in a couple of

841
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,679
cases

842
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,960
real life altercations um but

843
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,640
these are what work for me um i

844
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,159
wanted to give you some opportunities to

845
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,840
add these to your repertoire if you're a

846
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,200
martial arts practitioner

847
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,960
and if you're not um if you just are

848
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,480
interested in some self defense

849
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,320
um these are some great tools to add to

850
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,600
your tool bag um

851
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,000
to keep yourself safe and since we are

852
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,679
in confined spaces right now

853
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,960
um elbows are great because they don't

854
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,559
take up a lot of space so if you want to

855
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,399
do some shadow boxing in your apartment

856
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,679
or your house

857
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,600
you can do them without breaking stuff

858
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,320
so i love the elbow i love the elbow so

859
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,799
much

860
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,880
as a striking implement and a defensive

861
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,159
implement

862
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,880
the first reason is that elbow strikes

863
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,559
or elbows happen at the range of

864
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,440
conflict

865
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,559
um if you think about you know putting

866
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,039
your arm

867
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,159
all the way out most people are not in

868
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,480
conflicts at that range when people are

869
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,919
aggressive they're getting up in your

870
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,519
face and what that means is that

871
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,960
throwing a full length punch

872
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,080
is too far um so you need a

873
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,760
tool that is closer to hand right

874
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,360
something that handles that particular

875
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,678
range

876
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,480
the elbow when we think about striking

877
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,960
power we are concerned about force

878
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,919
over surface area um if you think about

879
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:30,559
your fist

880
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,399
right it's kind of wide right there's a

881
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,480
lot going on here in traditional kung fu

882
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,440
and leopard style

883
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,679
they use the leopard fist which takes

884
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,440
that same amount of force right that

885
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,320
same

886
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,000
amount of joint work and

887
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,159
applies it over a smaller surface area

888
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,840
well elbows do the same sort of thing

889
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,720
right we have

890
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,240
a much smaller surface area so the

891
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,399
penetrating power is

892
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,080
pretty pretty high in fact it's the

893
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,559
highest for a striking implement above

894
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,240
the waist

895
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,760
it doesn't have sensitive bones in there

896
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,600
i'm a piano player i

897
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,200
write code i need my fingers to work

898
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,039
right so um

899
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,880
i'm i'm less concerned about my elbow

900
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,639
having some small delicate bone broken

901
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,199
than i am

902
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,560
about my elbow you can use the elbow on

903
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,480
multiple angles and axes as we'll see in

904
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,800
the next slide

905
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,480
and uh because the elbow as we put it up

906
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,119
protects ourselves it is both defensive

907
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,560
and offensive

908
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,760
and then for those of you who've ever

909
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,359
seen black belt magazine that's my best

910
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:34,000
black felt magazine cover impression

911
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,079
so uh i would be

912
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,399
much i'd be greatly remiss in my martial

913
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,839
arts instructor duties if i didn't start

914
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,199
with stance

915
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,359
so what we're gonna cover here you can

916
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,599
use whatever stance is useful to you

917
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,399
but we've got

918
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,040
uh 70 of our weight on our front leg 30

919
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,719
on our back

920
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,079
our knees are bent we're nice and

921
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,760
comfortable right this isn't necessarily

922
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,359
a traditional stance this isn't a bow

923
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,640
and arrow stance or whatever you want to

924
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,839
call it

925
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,680
my weight is on the balls of my feet my

926
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,440
hands are up and relaxed but ready to

927
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,680
protect my face or my lower body

928
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,800
my chin is tucked and a square stance

929
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,880
meaning that both of my shoulders are

930
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,119
equal distance from my opponent

931
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,359
maximizes my weapon availability so i'm

932
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,040
not blading off right i'm not

933
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,480
turning one of my shoulders one

934
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,359
direction or another

935
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,760
some people might say especially if

936
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,040
you've been in boxing like well i know

937
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,320
how to throw a hook why would i do an

938
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,280
elbow

939
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,800
um an elbow is i think a more effective

940
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,480
tool than a hook and i'm talking about

941
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,599
proper hooks here

942
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,800
not haymakers so if you look

943
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,520
at my pointer up the first thing that i

944
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,400
do in this uh

945
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,520
animation is this kind of lubing punch

946
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:49,920
right

947
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,720
that's no good that is a haymaker um and

948
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,320
what's really dangerous about that is

949
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,119
that

950
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,800
you don't have a lot of your skeletal

951
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,960
structure reinforcing your strike so

952
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,079
it's a great way to break your fingers

953
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,119
or your wrist

954
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,960
um and you're not delivering a lot of

955
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,240
force because there's not a lot behind

956
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,280
it

957
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,359
a hook right is essentially a 90 degree

958
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,119
bend in your arm and you're using

959
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,320
rotational force

960
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,200
to deliver the strike um but again we've

961
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,880
got all those delicate fingers in there

962
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,599
going toward

963
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,800
the skull so there's a lot of hard

964
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,359
against hard going on in a hook strike

965
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,680
with an elbow we can protect ourselves a

966
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,800
little bit better

967
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,079
at the same distance as a hook

968
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,920
so elbows can rotate around the vertical

969
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,000
axis and the horizontal axis

970
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,640
and combining the two uh into and kind

971
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,880
of angled strike is really really

972
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
powerful

973
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,200
so what i'm doing here are kind of the

974
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,920
six stationary motions for elbows right

975
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,960
we've got horizontals

976
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,400
uh the overhand and then the

977
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,640
uh verticals coming up and down

978
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,960
and important here is that the power

979
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,400
just like every strike

980
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,040
is coming from the waist uh so pay close

981
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,079
attention uh

982
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,599
especially if you're practicing these to

983
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,280
your waist movement right

984
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,599
i am turning my waist and keeping my

985
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,800
feet grounded

986
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,280
right um if it's a strike with the rear

987
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,839
hand

988
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,079
um my rear foot is pivoting if it's a

989
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,160
strike with the lead hand

990
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,119
then my lead foot is pivoting it's

991
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,240
almost like i'm

992
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,839
crushing something out right now

993
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,160
these are stationary but there's another

994
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,200
directional

995
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,440
application of elbows which is forward

996
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
motion right i can

997
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,359
charge i can invade somebody else's

998
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,720
space if i need to

999
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,800
um with the elbow while protecting

1000
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,160
myself

1001
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,680
so this is the first move i wanted to

1002
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,079
share with you this is the crash

1003
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,599
so the idea here is that we are

1004
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,400
uh kind of intercepting maybe a haymaker

1005
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,800
or somebody else trying to come into us

1006
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,240
most commonly people are going to try to

1007
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,760
grab use right so there's there's this

1008
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,640
outside

1009
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,720
uh armature that we're trying to get

1010
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,760
inside

1011
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,560
so that first part right we're crashing

1012
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,320
in we're using a forward motion to get

1013
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,040
inside

1014
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,440
and notice that elbow as it leads is

1015
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,800
striking into the

1016
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,440
chest maybe the solar plexus depending

1017
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:15,839
on

1018
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,359
what we want to do um

1019
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,200
once we're there what's really important

1020
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,280
about this is that it's so unexpected it

1021
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,839
breaks

1022
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,000
your opponent i i should have said uh

1023
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,119
the attackers

1024
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,160
uda loop observe orient decide act

1025
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,400
your attacker has that right they have

1026
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,240
decided that they want to hurt you

1027
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,560
um you can interrupt that flow by doing

1028
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,839
something surprising

1029
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,440
like throw that elbow right into

1030
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,359
some squishy parts right there's a lot

1031
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,400
of stuff in here that's going to be

1032
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,839
painful if it's hit with a small point

1033
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,760
like an elbow

1034
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,920
from there you have the ability to take

1035
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,440
control of the situation

1036
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,119
and what i'm doing there is i'm grabbing

1037
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,359
heads i'm using a knee strike and then i

1038
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,359
can finish up with a vertical elbow

1039
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,839
um to the back

1040
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,520
so it's a great move to just and also

1041
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,960
notice that as i'm going in with a crash

1042
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,200
i'm covering my head so if there is

1043
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,320
another hook

1044
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,400
it's not going to hit my head forearm

1045
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,839
which is exactly what i want

1046
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,839
that should say move number two sorry i

1047
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,119
can't count

1048
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,000
um so this is the cross block and

1049
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,760
overhead and this was inspired by

1050
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,160
two styles one wing chun which is a

1051
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,839
style of kung fu from the south

1052
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,839
um the cranes wing in wing chun

1053
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,640
um is meant to redirect a blow off to

1054
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,280
the side

1055
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,920
uh 52 blocks which is an american style

1056
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,119
uses something called the skull and

1057
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,880
bones which is very very similar

1058
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,680
so what we do with uh this block here is

1059
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,240
that we're

1060
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,480
taking a strike we're kind of absorbing

1061
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,560
in a redirectory and off to the side

1062
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,200
but then we're using that overhand to

1063
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,440
control the incoming limb we're wrapping

1064
00:39:59,440 --> 00:39:59,920
it

1065
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,079
and then we're maybe pulling in but then

1066
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,839
we are delivering the elbow

1067
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,839
over it so that we have the ability to

1068
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,240
respond and control at the same time

1069
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,079
so we're taking care of our defense and

1070
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,160
then because we can catch in control

1071
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,560
right we are delivering the strike

1072
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,680
okay move actually number three then uh

1073
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,560
is the

1074
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,640
uh vagus combo the vagus nerve

1075
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,440
uh runs from the brain down the neck

1076
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,240
around the heart

1077
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,720
and the stomach if any of you have ever

1078
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,079
felt really really nauseous while you're

1079
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:36,880
working out

1080
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,839
that's the vagus nerve

1081
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,599
and it is a great target

1082
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,400
for knockouts if you deliver enough

1083
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,520
penetrating force to the vagus nerve

1084
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,599
your opponent will stop moving and so

1085
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,359
if i'm coming to the inside of an

1086
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,200
opponent and i really need to neutralize

1087
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:57,839
the threat

1088
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,480
that's something i want to try for so

1089
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,240
what's going on here is that my lead

1090
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,960
hand

1091
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,240
is blocking an incoming strike as i

1092
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,400
again intercept and almost crash with my

1093
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,240
rear elbow

1094
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,480
because that because that

1095
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,200
lead hand was intercepting a strike i'm

1096
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,319
on the inside

1097
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,119
and i can drop my hand down onto the

1098
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:21,520
neck

1099
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,680
attempting to strike the vagus nerve and

1100
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,359
then kind of as a finisher

1101
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,520
i'm using because i'm dropping my weight

1102
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,720
i can then

1103
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,200
spring back up with my rear elbow

1104
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,280
so it's a nice move and it feels good

1105
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,960
when you do it just as an exercise

1106
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,400
it's a it's a fun move to deliver

1107
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,400
um so those are the three moves that i

1108
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,680
wanted to share with you kind of

1109
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,760
unconventional uses of the elbow that

1110
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,079
maybe you can mix into your own practice

1111
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,520
um train hard fight easy right we want

1112
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,960
to protect ourselves right both

1113
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,040
of course physically and in a health

1114
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,040
sense but if we're learning self-defense

1115
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,000
we want to make sure that we're

1116
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,440
ready to use it when we have to um so

1117
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,640
you know you want to think about these

1118
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,240
tools figure out how they might work for

1119
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,040
you

1120
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,400
i make no claim that these tools will

1121
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,160
work the same for you as they do for me

1122
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,839
um everybody's kin aesthetics are

1123
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,839
different

1124
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,200
um but it's something to practice with i

1125
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,440
i think of martial arts like music right

1126
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,359
so you start by learning the forums you

1127
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,319
learn the drills

1128
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,760
right you're reciting other people's

1129
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,000
work and then after time you learn

1130
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,839
to improvise and create your own and

1131
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,599
that's kind of where

1132
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,960
you know i hope you can take this is

1133
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,720
that you can add this to your repertoire

1134
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,000
and play around with it
