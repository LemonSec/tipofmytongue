we can ignore who i am and except for

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,159
the fact that

36
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,880
yeah um i worked as a consultant in

37
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,520
tokyo

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,079
last summer and i worked for a japanese

39
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,960
bank in 2016 for a bit

40
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,799
so let's get into the nice part welcome

41
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,240
to japan

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,559
um

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,040
um as everyone knows it's all these

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,240
fancy little things

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,440
family mart skytree tokyo tower

46
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,760
on pikachu pokemon everyone knows that

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,760
let's get into the second stuff so as we

48
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,520
all know japan is one of the tech kings

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,640
in the world

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,680
and it has it's quite close

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,920
relationships with high security

52
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,120
um countries like the usa

53
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,599
and the uk it's also known for its work

54
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,879
ethics in terms of

55
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,000
the workforce raised from wheeled

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,040
so surely it's big on cyber security

57
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,360
now in my opinion and this is all in my

58
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,200
opinion the state of cyber security in

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,760
japan

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,120
is dude now let me explain why

61
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,959
first thing that i go straight to is

62
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,120
article 9 of the japanese constitution

63
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,640
from world war ii

64
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
the japanese people forever announced

65
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,560
their war as the sovereign right of the

66
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,519
nation

67
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,560
and the threat or use of force as means

68
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,200
to settle

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
international um disputes and therefore

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,720
sea

71
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,280
air forces as well as other war

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,319
potential

73
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,840
will never be maintained um

74
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,000
now for a lot of people don't realize

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,200
that also means

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,959
things like red teaming cannot be

77
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,519
contained

78
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,360
it also has led to the lack of

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,640
intelligence gathering

80
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
um a lot of people don't realize with

81
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,640
that it means that japanese

82
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,000
can't actually in theory gather

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,040
offensive information and that has

84
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,879
caused the lack in terms of cyber

85
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,518
intelligence

86
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,680
um according from um

87
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,920
from a colleague last summer was

88
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,000
there is no side and there is no insider

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
threat so we are safe now this is a

90
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
quote which he got from

91
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,920
another fellow colleague of his working

92
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,159
for another company

93
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,440
but it's a global threat i said when i

94
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,120
asked this when i was told this and said

95
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,600
well

96
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,279
surely they know about it and he goes

97
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,800
yeah they do

98
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,160
but they just don't care

99
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,080
and actually ask i want to ask everyone

100
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,639
does anyone know any japanese crackers

101
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,560
someone tweeted me this this morning i

102
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,720
was thinking about it and i go

103
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,120
i've never actually thought about it

104
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,479
because there's never it's never in the

105
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,680
news

106
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,280
and actually in terms of the scene in

107
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,759
terms of hackers there is one minor

108
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,840
thing which is the underground

109
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,759
so when you go into the underground the

110
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,160
shady part of the world

111
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,720
there is a small section of forums which

112
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,800
are all japanese

113
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,720
and the way they deal with cyber and the

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
way they they use it in terms of the

115
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,759
hackers and the

116
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,199
malicious law they actually do is by

117
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,639
malwa

118
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,400
because of this lack of offensive skills

119
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,039
which the country does not well now it

120
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,400
does actually have but originally it

121
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,039
doesn't

122
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,520
did not have they don't have the

123
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,919
technical skills to make ransomware

124
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,960
there are viruses trojans and it's led

125
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,160
to a need

126
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,520
to buy malwa so it was so it can be sold

127
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:25,840
from

128
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,320
russians koreans chinese there is

129
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
evidence of this

130
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,919
and the thing is is another thing is uh

131
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,039
japan is all

132
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,400
presents a lot of money there is a lot

133
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,919
of money there for example crypto

134
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,120
exchanges

135
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,639
crypto exchanges are a good place to

136
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,800
make money in terms of hacking

137
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,759
a good example is last summer um i think

138
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,639
it's the 17th

139
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,000
13th 17th of july bitcoin at crypto

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,240
exchange in japan was hit

141
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,240
i believe it was 13 32 million dollars

142
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,479
was it was lost originally they believe

143
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,400
it was lazarus i've actually worked on

144
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,440
it

145
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,840
but when you look at cybercrime in japan

146
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,039
is not common still

147
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,199
why is that well we can link this to

148
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,960
their culture

149
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,800
one of the biggest things um anyone

150
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,600
who's ever worked or visited in japan

151
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
is their belief in honor and then you

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,720
know it's

153
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,560
it it well it's the sixth virtue of

154
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,960
the judicial code which is you know

155
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,800
losing face

156
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,039
which for the japanese is something you

157
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,039
must avoid you cannot

158
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,319
be well you can't be ashamed you should

159
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,440
never be changed so

160
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,360
surely in terms of japan they should

161
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,280
truly avoid being hacked you know it's a

162
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,199
big thing when the country wanna come

163
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,520
on a company to be hacked you know if

164
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
you ever see

165
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,160
um when a daily call or something goes

166
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,199
wrong in japan

167
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,639
there's always the great press

168
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,800
conferences where they barrel and

169
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,560
you know look very sorry and the media

170
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,160
actually talks into this

171
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,199
media in japan is very very very

172
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,080
malicious in the way of they will use

173
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,919
anything to get happen so it's really

174
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,520
dangerous for a company

175
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,560
in terms of their reputation customers

176
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,599
to make a mistake so surely

177
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,240
we've then wanted to avoid it well what

178
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,199
do you do

179
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,639
in terms of being secure cyber security

180
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,000
well you know you get guidelines and

181
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,400
whatnot let's have a look at those

182
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,520
policies frameworks and guidelines um

183
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,120
most of these are very basic because

184
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
i'm still slightly lagging behind in my

185
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,240
opinion

186
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,919
and one of the most the most key which

187
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,680
comes to mind is the basic act for cyber

188
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,120
security

189
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,280
which is um how the japanese government

190
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,160
responds

191
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,879
to the global threat of hackers it also

192
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,160
describes how

193
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,080
the concept of cybersecurity and one of

194
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,599
the roles and responsibilities of the

195
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,639
government

196
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,400
and local governments and how the

197
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,000
stakeholders

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,520
are required to um work with

199
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,360
other companies and the whole nation

200
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,479
it also gives power to the

201
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,520
uh national security strategy

202
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,199
strategy high uh headquarters

203
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,599
which um allows them to have power and

204
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,120
to do something which we will go on to

205
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,759
now which is the iot's

206
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,479
so if anyone keeps up to date with

207
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,000
japanese substitutes they'll know about

208
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,879
the iot

209
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,240
government perhaps so the government

210
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,599
in preparation for um conduct

211
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,719
yeah for preparation of the olympics

212
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,839
were given gave the national institution

213
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,120
of information

214
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,599
the community communication technology

215
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,679
the power to go and hack

216
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,560
iots everywhere i've been everywhere in

217
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,600
the nation

218
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,279
and the way they did it was using

219
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,800
default passwords these

220
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,360
default usernames

221
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,480
but with all this preparation why do i

222
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,760
still see the scenes being weak

223
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
cyber security is expensive that's the

224
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,279
first thing any ceo says

225
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,519
in terms of japan and actually this is a

226
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,760
quote cyber reducing expense not

227
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,279
necessity

228
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,240
but in the uk it's seen as an essential

229
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,680
thing we even have something called

230
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,160
cyber essentials which is required for

231
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,120
every company to follow in the house

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,000
why you know about japan doesn't have it

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,480
so maybe that's a mistake

234
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,040
the other reason is they don't share

235
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
their information

236
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,680
as you can see on the graph japanese

237
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,880
companies don't

238
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,200
i quite like really sharing information

239
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,399
compared to

240
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,959
global companies and this was done in

241
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,480
2016

242
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,720
but

243
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,080
why is that why don't they share

244
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
um four reasons given at the time

245
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,080
was no adequate information sharing

246
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,279
framework

247
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,200
concerns over how other companies would

248
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,880
use personal information

249
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,279
no the technology wasn't there to share

250
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,720
it and turn no trust with

251
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,720
uh competitors the other reason in my

252
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,360
opinion

253
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,720
which i think is more likely is shame

254
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
losing face it's just so much of their

255
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,040
culture that it might affect it

256
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,560
are these reasons valid

257
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,279
as you've seen i've thrown a load of

258
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,480
frameworks

259
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,079
which actually all do okay we'll cover

260
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:30,800
the

261
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,519
critical infrastructure in japan and how

262
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,760
companies work

263
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,680
i just realized i've lost through this

264
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,000
whoops

265
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,760
so it makes the um some of the reasons

266
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,480
for

267
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,440
the reasons for the ref uh given why

268
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,040
they don't share being valid actually

269
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,279
you know there is the right framework

270
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,920
most of these frameworks actually cover

271
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,480
if not

272
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,200
every single sector banks and crypto

273
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,480
exchange have the

274
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,680
financial services

275
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,160
our car manufacturers have the auto rsac

276
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,959
most companies have the um initiative

277
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,839
for cyber security information sharing

278
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,640
partnership

279
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,319
so in my opinion

280
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,959
the reason why threat intelligence is

281
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,200
not big in japan

282
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,959
is just down to losing face

283
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,839
but this is a weakness for japan now so

284
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,959
i can ask

285
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,320
you know the japanese government trying

286
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
to get around this

287
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,440
this is where basic act comes into power

288
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,360
the second amendment of the bet of the

289
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,600
basic act on subsequent

290
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,160
security council losing that was

291
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,440
established

292
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,680
the purpose of it is to enhance the

293
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,040
information sharing between

294
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,519
members of the committee and to provide

295
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,000
cyber security

296
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,480
and it also allowed for a uh taskforce

297
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,360
to be

298
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920
introduced which was made up of

299
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,360
companies externally like british

300
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,160
companies

301
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,200
i know and american and

302
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
other places to be introduced and

303
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,240
brought into the cup

304
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,240
into the government as sort of

305
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,480
i'm not supposed to happening sisters as

306
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,800
such

307
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,399
but what about now

308
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,160
national uh center uh incident readiness

309
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,079
and strategy for cyber security released

310
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,200
a strategy

311
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,120
what was it last year yes i think it was

312
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,240
last year

313
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,839
are they i don't know no two days ago

314
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,760
sorry that's my father

315
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,440
they've set out some basic goals for

316
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,800
what they wanted to do the next few

317
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,560
years

318
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,880
um

319
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,600
which were aimed completely of promoting

320
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,000
security in companies and society as you

321
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,120
can see

322
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,200
the three goals are i'm trying to write

323
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,959
very very sorry

324
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,279
but what about the future as such

325
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,480
now one of the measures in place is

326
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,440
establishing

327
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,839
educational measures as seen in the uk

328
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,200
and the us

329
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,279
teaching people is a key there's an

330
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,440
important key for having a secure nation

331
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,000
and a strong

332
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,120
cyber security sector myself

333
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,839
the reason why i've seen to profit as i

334
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,920
am doing right now is because i've done

335
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,160
i've been interested in it and according

336
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,360
to unicorns which has

337
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,639
helped me progressed in the sector a bit

338
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,720
luckily for uh for japan there are

339
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,560
british companies now being promoted to

340
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,839
come over to japan and this ncc

341
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,040
shadow star trace ncd which is neon

342
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,800
cyber defense

343
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,079
bt they're all being brought over

344
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,680
and that is why i say there's money in

345
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,120
japan because there are a lot more

346
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,040
companies but you can't

347
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,560
so let's talk about you know seeing some

348
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,119
examples

349
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,800
now by chance i was asked by

350
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,320
uh by someone at the british embassy

351
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,639
i'd make money in tokyo in terms of a

352
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,920
cyber security way and i said well

353
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,959
i'll do the metro do it by railway and

354
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:25,519
he goes

355
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,880
oh really why is that sorry my notes

356
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,519
from the wrong

357
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,279
page and i go well

358
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,040
if you look at the metro it makes up

359
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
the controls majority of tokyo it's

360
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,880
amazing i wish it was here in britain

361
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,519
it would be brilliant but let's say

362
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,880
about somewhere occurs

363
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,560
you know would it shut down the metro

364
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,079
and most people go no it wouldn't

365
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,320
well okay let me give you an example a

366
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,839
fire

367
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,560
so when i was in tokyo last year and

368
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,440
when

369
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,120
by chance three of my colleagues from

370
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,959
traveling to work the fire occurred on

371
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,320
their lane well they're not that they

372
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,199
playing

373
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,680
their uh track one single track of the

374
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,480
whole

375
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,760
of metro is nothing isn't it no no

376
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,560
biggie but

377
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,959
they were three hours late you know

378
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,000
tokyo is big

379
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,720
but that might explain it well actually

380
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,839
that one single fighter stopped quarter

381
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,079
of

382
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,319
the whole of the whole of tokyo's metro

383
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,680
but that's only a quarter you say well

384
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
shinjuku station which is the biggest

385
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,160
the busiest transportation in the world

386
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,440
that has is about

387
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,040
three million about 3.5 million

388
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,959
people per day in 2018 and even more now

389
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:41,920
actually

390
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,680
based off the statistics i have found

391
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,519
recently

392
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,880
so let's say a quarter of that

393
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,839
used quarter of the metro so that's

394
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,160
about

395
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,199
um about million actually around about a

396
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,959
million

397
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,720
which is about three times more than

398
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,120
what waterloo has is going through it

399
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,839
in 2018

400
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,399
i don't know why my uh it seems to be

401
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,360
that mine

402
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,880
the audio is a bit missing there

403
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,480
hitting this actually apparently oh

404
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,320
sorry

405
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,639
um i'll try and speak up actually it

406
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,560
might be some in my kitchen and echoes a

407
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,000
bit

408
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,320
so probably shut down of the metro

409
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,600
would cause a quite big trouble of quite

410
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,040
a lot of trouble for tokyo

411
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,480
it actually caused them to completely

412
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,320
stop but people go well what about taxis

413
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,160
i heard texas is amazing in japan

414
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,519
and i go yeah they are there's not

415
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,440
enough and people go what about the

416
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,880
buses the buses

417
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,320
are basically a small van i wish i

418
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,680
actually had a photo of it it's

419
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,120
really really small they're very cute

420
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,959
actually do highly recommend you

421
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,519
searching it up actually

422
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,839
but why would people go after the metro

423
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,440
well there is money involved

424
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,639
but it's more for power

425
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,359
um as japan actually don't have the

426
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,000
ability

427
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,319
or the power to get around ransomware in

428
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,119
the metro

429
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,199
so let's go on to the next next example

430
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,280
i have which is

431
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,319
water eg dams actually

432
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,119
now when i say dams most people tell me

433
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,640
not to talk about it or

434
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,400
no saying leave at least it doesn't

435
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,240
matter and i go well

436
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,000
actually let me talk about and let me

437
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,319
explain japanese love dance and i'm not

438
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,120
joking

439
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,039
but it's the japanese they love building

440
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,480
things

441
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,000
and they're very good at building things

442
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
and that's true

443
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,000
but beyond catches up with the new dams

444
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,360
are being connected to networks

445
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,559
and therefore things are being at risk

446
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,840
in terms of the technology

447
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,480
most dams nowadays are still air gaps

448
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,200
there's no

449
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,960
no connection to networks but i know a

450
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,240
couple in japan

451
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,600
which i visited which are being

452
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,320
connected slowly

453
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
but why haven't we seen any attacks and

454
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,520
damage you ask um

455
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,760
very simple answer there's no money in

456
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,360
it obviously

457
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,480
you know you're not going to find

458
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,080
personal data you would be able to sell

459
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,720
that

460
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,840
but it's about power so you know

461
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,799
you could afford a flooding well most

462
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,320
people when i mentioned this especially

463
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,799
the locals said oh but tokyo has got a

464
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,559
really good flooding system

465
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,559
and i go yeah it's a beast but if you've

466
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,960
ever seen guy martin's foul guy in japan

467
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,080
which i highly recommend you go and

468
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,600
watch it's a really good cultural

469
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,880
reasons

470
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,200
you notice you will notice if you watch

471
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,400
when it goes to the

472
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,440
flooding system the screen that they

473
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:35,760
show

474
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,400
is really old operating systems nearly

475
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,120
as long as dinosaurs in my opinion

476
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,919
but what you know imagine is getting

477
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,919
access to that

478
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,679
and getting access to the dams and just

479
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,440
turning off the dams allowing the water

480
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,559
to flood down

481
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,200
and then telling us the flooding system

482
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,960
i think it would be drenched

483
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,080
there'd be nothing left now i'll go to

484
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,160
what the uh so i asked the question back

485
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,600
to the official and said oh

486
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,280
what would you do and you go seven

487
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,000
elevens i know seven elevens why would

488
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,400
you go

489
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,760
after a convenience store

490
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,919
now i promise i'm not sponsored by them

491
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:16,880
but

492
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
seven london's my opinions are really i

493
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,679
love them to bits

494
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,960
but there is a reason why i'm talking

495
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,880
about

496
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,080
there's about twenty hundred

497
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,760
seven elevens in japan two thousand

498
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,600
nineteen that's about thirty one percent

499
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,400
of

500
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,280
total of the total known seven elevens

501
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,320
in the world

502
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,120
you can pay your bills you can pay your

503
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,799
you can buy advantage to make copies of

504
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,880
your emails

505
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,200
basically everything that the japanese

506
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,679
ever need

507
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,080
but why would you target them

508
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,440
well there's actually money involved in

509
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,280
this as you can see atp

510
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,600
they're not eating these atms are on the

511
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,280
list

512
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,039
that's good i'll use them actually i

513
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,640
regularly use them to get

514
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,400
in and out of prisons um but let's say

515
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,919
you target the app now seven elevens do

516
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,360
actually have an app and it's really

517
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,880
really interesting

518
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,640
because that was what the answer of the

519
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,760
official was you said oh i target the

520
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,240
so i just give him a bit of money maybe

521
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,679
even just still the details like that's

522
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,360
brilliant

523
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,559
but surely it's not going to have much

524
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,200
effect

525
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,600
and he goes well you know there's about

526
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,000
five deliveries per day for 7-eleven

527
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
and i go

528
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,640
but then he goes think about it like

529
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,159
this

530
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,200
if you chop that down most seven lambs

531
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
are used for social services available

532
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,960
and fill your daily food you can get

533
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,320
clothing from it

534
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,760
let's turn that all off imagine that's

535
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,360
not going to turn up every day

536
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,600
for a week seven levels would be out of

537
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,918
business

538
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,480
and there wouldn't be any sober noodles

539
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,760
and this is where i leave this part of

540
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,799
the talk and talk about food

541
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,679
so in this part in this half i'm going

542
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,400
to talk about

543
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,840
some japanese food a little bit of

544
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,679
culture and how to make these brilliant

545
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,799
dishes

546
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,320
as a uni student um when i asked most

547
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,039
people what

548
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,559
taking japanese food they think of ramen

549
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,679
sushi with snacks

550
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,720
nice flavors well weird nice flavored

551
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,640
kitkats they're actually really good

552
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,120
i've got a load here

553
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,439
but

554
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,559
this is pancake time so we have to talk

555
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,720
about taking things

556
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,559
and sober noodles in my client but hey

557
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,840
let's uh

558
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,280
the waters of the kitchen as i define

559
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,960
them um if the

560
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,679
term actually does completely translate

561
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:04,880
into

562
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,559
in front of the chopping board or the

563
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,080
board into the

564
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,799
reference to the chopping board isn't

565
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,880
just a phrase it is a title it's a title

566
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,480
that has to be owned so why am i showing

567
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,919
you restaurants

568
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,039
well this is where you earn them so what

569
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,120
makes it so special well let's start

570
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,120
starting out sushi chefs for example

571
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,039
it's a very long journey and it always

572
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,200
starts off as being an apprentice

573
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,720
first people's apprentice preparing

574
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,240
sushi rice

575
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,360
most importantly walking the rice

576
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,200
you do this possibly you can do this for

577
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,280
about two years on the fridge i believe

578
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,760
it was

579
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,080
when i last checked i actually was

580
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,159
talking to an apprentice last year

581
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,240
about when he was when wow i don't go to

582
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,159
sushi places because i can't eat some

583
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,679
sushi but i was talking to a chap

584
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,120
actually whilst i was eating

585
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,559
another restaurant and he turned out to

586
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,320
be an apprentice oh my gosh that's

587
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,640
extraordinary why why this long why do

588
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,720
you do it for so long and he goes well

589
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,159
i haven't got it perfected yet they will

590
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,039
keep doing it

591
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,760
until the senior chef is happy with that

592
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,640
daily

593
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,200
and it has to be daily and then they get

594
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,720
promoted

595
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,080
to do fresh ingredients and sit

596
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,720
and by chance i can't i can't actually

597
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,840
i've tried

598
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,240
multiple times before doing this talk

599
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,919
and i just struggle with it

600
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,760
i'm not going to butcher it but i'll

601
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,720
translate it for you it translates to

602
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,280
um basically next to the board

603
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,640
because that's where they are they have

604
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,400
sat next to the board

605
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,039
separating prep prepping for the fresh

606
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,600
ingredients

607
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,480
um uh

608
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,559
green ginger sorry i'm lagging a bit

609
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,840
here

610
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,159
but eventually the chef the apprentice

611
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,640
will start preparing food for clients

612
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,679
when for a takeaway and then we even

613
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,880
start learning how to

614
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
interact with the customers by watching

615
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,640
this senior chef

616
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,480
and then for another few years for about

617
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,640
three years i believe it is

618
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,760
you then become the senior chef you

619
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,000
get the authorization just stand in

620
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
stocks stand in front of a chopping ball

621
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,200
you think about it you can be in your

622
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,600
kitchen doing chopping board now

623
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,240
you know right front okay and that's

624
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,919
something which the japanese have to

625
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:26,400
learn and

626
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,600
it's not just japanese if i went over

627
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,200
there and i want to do a pre-apprentice

628
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,480
it's something that can be earned

629
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,360
performance and

630
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,679
people don't realize that some people

631
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,360
argue with me on this but

632
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,120
there's a reason why i bring it up is

633
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,039
because some other titles can't be

634
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,520
earned by friends this is one very few

635
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,880
which a foreigner can own

636
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,039
now for the stars of our show and as

637
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,600
such fluffy japanese souffle pancakes

638
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,440
and super noodles style i'll get to that

639
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,279
one

640
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,240
brunch anyone um japanese souffle

641
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,520
pancakes are delicious

642
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,799
they are basically pillows

643
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,320
but how would you what are they

644
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,919
different from any normal pancake well

645
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:10,480
it is

646
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,679
but it's all about the eggs it's a

647
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,240
souffle um

648
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,679
i'm not going to talk about the whole

649
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,840
recipe you actually have recipe in two

650
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,919
parts this is quite a long one

651
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,520
um the reason why i'm not going to talk

652
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,400
about it is it's a dopamine

653
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,640
but i will show you some tips to talk

654
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,880
about the

655
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,679
um first thing straight away is

656
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,000
killing your egg whites great people

657
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,679
especially in the u.s

658
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,679
say no bring out to room temperature

659
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,440
actually in japan they don't they want

660
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,640
to keep it chilled

661
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,760
it's a lot of japanese

662
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,880
they use chilled

663
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,080
egg whites for the meringue it's

664
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,799
an intriguing one and also it allows

665
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,559
them to not need tartar

666
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,159
cream tartar which be fair

667
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,200
it's twice nice i don't have tartar i'm

668
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,320
a student i don't

669
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,159
purposely buy things which i might not

670
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,360
use again

671
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,720
another thing which is on the recipe

672
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,960
i've got there is electric

673
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,760
electric mixer i'm tuning i definitely

674
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,279
don't have

675
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,320
but you can do it by hand um

676
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,720
it's quite simple when you first start

677
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,000
doing it you want to go

678
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,679
back and forth back and forth back and

679
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,760
forth until it starts going phone

680
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,159
then you do vigorous circles motions

681
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,000
until it's got its peaks

682
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,640
it's a lovely load lovely lovely peaky

683
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,679
mountains and such

684
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,640
as my mom used to

685
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,799
excuse my title i had to put this in

686
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,320
but the first tip straight away is you

687
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,760
don't want your prank pancakes to be

688
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,400
spotless

689
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,559
uh spotless like spotty not spotless you

690
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,240
want them to be spotless

691
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,279
um do wipe away the excess oil

692
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,279
a lot of people don't do that the normal

693
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,600
pancakes i highly recommend

694
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,120
um i've just seen a question yes i shall

695
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,880
share them

696
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,240
definitely will share them um

697
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,039
i will should death some webs there i'll

698
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:11,840
shout

699
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,840
something i shall suggest some websites

700
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,960
to go to

701
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,760
i just highly recommend just search up

702
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
fluffy pancakes

703
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,679
japanese pancakes there's tons of webs

704
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,000
tons of websites that do recipes

705
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,360
um i will go through it

706
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,880
um later on oh that's trump think i'll

707
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,600
try to remember

708
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,559
some another thing is cook them slow

709
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:36,960
long

710
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,640
and covered with a lid loki reason why

711
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,360
is think about it as a marshmallow so

712
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,799
when you're melting a marshmallow it

713
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,000
gets

714
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,159
sort of squeaky on the outside but hard

715
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,360
in the center

716
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,600
now turn out the opposite way around

717
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
that's what a japanese pancake can be

718
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,960
like if you cook it too

719
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,240
on too much of a high heat it will cook

720
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,760
on the outside you go it's great it's

721
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,640
ready

722
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,240
open up and it's all squishy you don't

723
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,679
want that you want to put it long and

724
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,559
slow

725
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,919
so everything cooks at a good rate

726
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,520
the other thing which a lot of people

727
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
ask straight away is how do you make

728
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,880
them all stacked

729
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,399
now there are two ways of doing this i

730
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,240
haven't mentioned it on this one

731
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,360
but you can get a mold just get a mold

732
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,799
or make your own mold

733
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,440
it's brilliant but i don't really have

734
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,559
the money

735
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,960
to buy a mold so i like to do it the

736
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,120
more traditional way in some ways

737
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,000
which is you could be doing one scoop

738
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,360
for a few seconds let's cook

739
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,320
another scoop let it cook scoop don't do

740
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,080
it too high you can't put the lid on

741
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,799
i know someone who's done that it's a

742
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,120
bit

743
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,840
messed to be fair

744
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,760
all right so

745
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
the rest of the recipe is pretty much

746
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,000
your normal pancake

747
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
but it is a nice challenge so maybe at

748
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,320
all in quarantine as such

749
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,000
why don't we make them tomorrow but

750
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,440
probably all my shops have run out of

751
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,039
beds

752
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,919
that's a shame for me

753
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,240
japanese pizza or japanese pancakes

754
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
i originally used to call them pancake

755
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,000
noodle pancakes

756
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,279
because i can say i'm bombing see i'm

757
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,159
struggling now

758
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,679
it's one of those few words i've really

759
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,840
just do struggle with

760
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,240
but they are brilliant for everyone

761
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,760
because

762
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,640
you can put anything in it basically and

763
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,919
there are some things i would

764
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,960
recommend you don't put in like nuts i

765
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,480
don't know why anyone would

766
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,159
but hey i haven't tried it

767
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,919
um but it's good for leftovers my highly

768
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,600
recommended fire i would highly

769
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,120
recommend it for leftovers

770
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,679
because the recipe is literally five

771
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,000
steps

772
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,520
you shorten it to four actually in my

773
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,919
opinion but i think it's five just to

774
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,080
make it easier for everyone

775
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,559
you just prep your veg and you cut them

776
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,720
up and say slightly strip more strips so

777
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,840
about that size

778
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
or that size don't do them too big a

779
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,720
little bit sort of a bit wavy

780
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,320
um and then you throw it you can throw

781
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:12,799
it all in

782
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,039
now sometimes you can't put noodles in

783
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,480
it so a lot of the time it's a noodle

784
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,120
bed

785
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,960
i've not put noodles on this because i

786
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
just realized if you've got to

787
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,279
that's my mistake i did it off a recipe

788
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,640
which doesn't do noodles i've just

789
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,080
realized that

790
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,240
oh well but you can just i would

791
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,600
recommend either so

792
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,200
not soda um do not

793
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,720
middle noodles would probably be the

794
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,559
best one for this

795
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,960
um the other one is egg noodles all

796
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,320
ramen noodles

797
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,200
they work quite well as well but food on

798
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,559
the thick squidgy

799
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,919
sort of feeling of the noodles they're

800
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,480
really nice it goes well with the actual

801
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,440
sauce i don't rush the sauce because you

802
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,679
can do it again on monoki

803
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,279
sauce but what's the source is just

804
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,519
cheaper in the uk

805
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,679
and it doesn't cost me three quid but to

806
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,840
be fair you can get it at good prices

807
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,919
um the other thing is actually

808
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,679
when you've done it and when it's

809
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,279
traditionally as you can see they've

810
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,320
done like a grid

811
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,559
it's good for children and i do this for

812
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,840
my brother

813
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,240
you can draw what the japanese

814
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,320
traditionally do is they draw

815
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,720
draw on the top of them so children will

816
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,640
wrote an anime character

817
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,360
or weird symbol and it looks amazing

818
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,679
with mayo

819
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,440
if you ever seen i highly recommend

820
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,760
actually search what

821
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,000
uh mayo bottle my boss hair bottle looks

822
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,880
like

823
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,880
because they're real they're not like a

824
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,399
normal bottle which is

825
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,360
like a sort of got like that more of a

826
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,240
hair so it allows for a more accurate

827
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,440
drawing

828
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,240
very good statement to say but hey and

829
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,799
actually our

830
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,559
ikea key is quite popular because

831
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,240
there's two main reasons

832
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,080
but the normal is traditionally prepared

833
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,360
right in front of you and cook right

834
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,279
front of you on a hot grid

835
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,640
not alcohol hot plate

836
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,200
i normally go to somewhere where i have

837
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,720
a local place where i go to which is

838
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,760
brilliant

839
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,240
and then do it right from me you can

840
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,919
watch the food symphony it's amazing

841
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,600
but first tip don't try and flip it on

842
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,440
the grid it's not for you to flip it's

843
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,559
the chest

844
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,440
hit the honor please be respectful the

845
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,519
other thing is um

846
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,960
it's quite easy to make so it's quite

847
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,720
traditional traditionally

848
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,039
found at street markets as well street

849
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,080
festivals

850
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,279
quite easy to make very nice to eat

851
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,000
excuse me what sober i'm sober

852
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,720
um i originally when i first told when i

853
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,200
first found out about these

854
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,559
uh told it to my best friend we were

855
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,240
both when we were a team

856
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,720
we couldn't talk about it i think you

857
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,840
can see the reason why

858
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,159
but to be fair one code means bold

859
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,440
and this is why um isn't

860
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,399
why it's called microserver because when

861
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,080
you eat with soda

862
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,120
it's just odor noodles you have them in

863
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,679
small bowls about this big

864
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,480
um and you continuously like if you've

865
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,880
ever

866
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,519
if i highly recommend search up the

867
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,880
great bank sober challenge

868
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,720
food challenge because it's the most

869
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,640
funniest thing if you just watch people

870
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,159
continuously eat them i think the record

871
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,240
is 507 bowls

872
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,159
which is a lot of bowls and i mean these

873
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,240
fill you up quite fast

874
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,480
um but you can't take a break you can't

875
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,640
stop to digest

876
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,039
and to finish and i mean like the server

877
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,000
will be right next to you

878
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,080
not you don't go up and back the server

879
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,120
sits there with a tray

880
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,440
about this tall multiple trays of these

881
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,240
bowls

882
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,200
and just continuously

883
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,720
the only way to stop it is to pass out i

884
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,279
don't know i

885
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,679
highly recommend that one or put your

886
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,760
lid on your bowl

887
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,399
just respect the way of doing it and to

888
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,039
be fair

889
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,440
passing out slightly harder to explain

890
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,640
it's japanese when you can't speak

891
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,200
japanese

892
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,679
but i don't recommend people do this

893
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,159
upon i'm going to point this out now but

894
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,440
you can use words for

895
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,399
not microsoft you can use sober noodles

896
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,520
in your arm

897
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,119
especially in the instagram come on

898
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,879
they service the taste of japan as a

899
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,480
student instant noodles especially

900
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,320
instant ramen and staple food

901
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,918
students around the world i believe that

902
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,480
because playing a lot of instant noodles

903
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,520
majority of uni students i know instant

904
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,560
noodles

905
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,239
i like to buy them from my creative shop

906
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,320
or local one down the road

907
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,119
quite nice but to be fair it's not the

908
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,000
most filling thing

909
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,839
it's not really the healthiest thing so

910
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,760
how would you change that

911
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,520
well adding an eggs always a good way

912
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,040
it's a good amount of protein it's quite

913
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,679
filling

914
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,560
you cannot add another protein but eggs

915
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,280
are cheap

916
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,399
and if you want to go completely

917
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,520
protection i'll do a soft coiled egg

918
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,239
not a soft heart a soft boiled egg cut

919
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,359
it in half and then you have your

920
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,239
traditional egg

921
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,480
shown on the traditional sort of egg and

922
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,839
wrong

923
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,000
um a lot of people don't realize that

924
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,760
it's as simple as that

925
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,200
adding herbs um as i like to cook a lot

926
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,720
i always have herbs

927
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,880
but having one herb changes a lot of

928
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,240
dishes so i highly recommend getting

929
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,959
that if you're a student

930
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,520
kimchi um it is korean

931
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,119
most people shout on me for this going

932
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,800
it's not japanese and i'm like

933
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,280
if you've been to tokyo you realize

934
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,119
saying oh it's not japanese is the wrong

935
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:27,920
thing to say

936
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,119
because you realize that most of the

937
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,640
restaurants in japan

938
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,359
especially in tokyo aren't japanese

939
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,440
they're italian french

940
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,200
not british that's not cuisine but

941
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,960
um and korean are cuisines and japanese

942
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,359
chefs will make it their their life work

943
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,599
to do those dishes which are of a

944
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,960
certain cuisine

945
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,079
to perfection i actually have a stand-up

946
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,200
italian down where i live in tokyo and

947
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,640
it's quite funny you walk past and you

948
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,960
see all the uh middle aged women

949
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,680
with their glasses standing up and it's

950
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,280
like

951
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,560
you've never seen this in the uk or

952
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,320
anywhere in the world

953
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,920
let alone japan you'd think about

954
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,520
everyone sitting down being very polite

955
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,480
come on

956
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,560
there was nothing after the one what's

957
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,079
the chef there's cooking away

958
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,240
really nice i highly recommend if you do

959
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,760
go to tokyo

960
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
do try something else than just japanese

961
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,640
you'll be surprised

962
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,800
or uh flavoured oils are a really good

963
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,280
one they're sesame oil especially

964
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,240
ramen traditionally is quite oily well

965
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,200
depending on

966
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,440
how it's cooked so adding a bit of oil

967
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,240
doesn't

968
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,720
uh makes it quite nice makes it more

969
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,200
traditional tasting

970
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,880
um frozen fetch not fruit veg

971
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,880
is a good way of doing it in terms of

972
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,400
making it slightly more healthier and

973
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,000
silent film

974
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,640
most people when i originally suggest

975
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,560
this go that's not traditional i'm like

976
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,720
that's not the point you're a student

977
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,560
you're trying to fill yourself up

978
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,000
or if you're not student which i know

979
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,560
some of you aren't still good filling if

980
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,200
you just want to have a snack

981
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,920
dash of soy sauce traditional things

982
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,440
seaweed is another one

983
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,880
they're all good things quite you can

984
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,960
get them quite cheap from a normal store

985
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,760
or if

986
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,200
for example in the uk i know there's a

987
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,359
lot of korean and japanese

988
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,720
local shops just pop into one of them

989
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,760
they're not actually a bad price i get a

990
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,599
lot of my stuff i get a lot of japanese

991
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,480
food

992
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,119
in the uk by going to those shops i

993
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,400
missed japanese food

994
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,480
i was hitting more in the uk but there

995
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,880
isn't unfortunately

996
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,839
the last one is add more noodles i have

997
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,359
a pack of noodles i don't think this

998
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,680
would wish you've got it

999
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,280
it's always a good thing all i normally

1000
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,720
do is i eat the noodles the first

1001
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,400
original pack of noodles

1002
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
whilst cooking another pack and put it

1003
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,520
in with the broth

1004
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,839
still tastes nice still and normally the

1005
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,359
noodles are better quality

1006
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,800
so normally get them from my korean shop

1007
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,920
so hey

1008
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,680
i highly recommend you can get doing

1009
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
this if you are bored

1010
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,200
or if you just put in some noodles and

1011
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,160
you've got some spare stuff

1012
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,000
and i've lost through that gloss for

1013
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,800
that quite fast

1014
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,839
thank you for listening

1015
