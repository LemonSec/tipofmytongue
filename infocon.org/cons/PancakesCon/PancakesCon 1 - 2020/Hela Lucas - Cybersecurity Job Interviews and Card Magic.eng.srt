interviews

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,320

fascinating uh this is hila lucas uh

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,680
this is not her first time speaking to

12

an audience but it is her first time in

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,160
a webinar

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,680
and uh bear with me just one second

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,640
hey there we are so cyber security job

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,680
interviews

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,120
hillary's on a mission to create

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,440
resources to prepare for cyber security

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,480
job interviews

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,239
when i was preparing and revising for my

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,000
interviews half the time was spent

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,600
collecting resources

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,440
rather than developing my skills or

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,039
learning new things

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,800
i want to break down this barrier for

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,079
newcomers to the industry

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,840
and show them the basics of what they

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,840
need to know in order to get those first

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,640
jobs and

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,000
internships in the industry followed up

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,320
with card magic i've been doing card

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,640
magic for about five years on and off

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,560
this talk i'm terribly sorry about the

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
chime this talk will teach a few methods

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
of card handling basic moves you will

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,080
need to learn to get started

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,080
and to point people to resources for

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,439
learning more

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,439
it would be best experience if you have

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,360
a deck of cards you can use to follow

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,479
along with however

42
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,439
that's not 100 necessary so without

43
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,799
further ado

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,079

56
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,119
soon

57
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,640
um so this talk is or the first part of

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,479
this talk is the talk that i wish i had

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,919
seen about three years ago when i

60
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,200
started applying for my first

61
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,000
internships within cyber security

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,840
um i um as it was mentioned

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,599
i spent a lot of time preparing for

64
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,360
interviews um

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,480
and in a kind of macro sense i'm

66
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,440
kind of wanting to make sure that cyber

67
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,160
security has the same resources

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,280
that software engineers have um

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,160
in terms of recruitment and interviewing

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,840
so i don't know if anybody has ever

71
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,080
seen a software engineering recruitment

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,920
process but especially at kind of

73
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,760
college or university level

74
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,680
there's talks workshops websites

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,400
question banks job boards

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
and we don't have that in cyber so i'm

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
really looking to to make that kind of

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,519
content

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,760
uh and make this more accessible so if

80
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,440
you're interested in collaborating on

81
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,560
that or

82
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,720
um think you could help please get in

83
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,400
touch later

84
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,400
so um without further ado

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,200
uh this is the agenda so we're gonna i'm

86
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
gonna talk a little bit about who i am

87
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,640
and what makes me qualified to talk

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,560
about this now we're going to go

89
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,879
over interview types how to prepare for

90
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,720
interviews the kinds of knowledge

91
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
that are the kind of topics that you

92
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,000
might expect to come up in the

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,879
interviews

94
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,120
i'm going to point you to some resources

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,080
that you can use

96
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,400
and then uh final thoughts and then

97
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,360
we'll move on to

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,599
magic tricks so

99
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,879
oh a small disclaimer this is all based

100
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,120
on my personal experience

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,640
um so obviously this might be a little

102
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,480
different for you i haven't interviewed

103
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:44,799
at

104
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,720
every company um this does not reflect

105
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,400
the views of my previous

106
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,560
future employers or my university um

107
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,400
and i have done interviews where i

108
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
signed an nda

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,879
um before taking them and i'm not

110
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,319
sharing any information

111
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,040
that um was discussed or disclosed in

112
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,920
those interviews

113
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,519
uh and one other thing i do have a

114
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,080
slight blue team bias so i have worked

115
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,120
as a security engineer um and

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,959
in threat intelligence uh so this is

117
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,639
yeah if you're looking to get into pen

118
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,560
testing i might not be the best person

119
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,918
to talk to you

120
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,840
but i will share some resources for that

121
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,159
as well

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,120
so um a little introduction to me

i used to be part of the edinburgh

135
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
neighbor university security society

136
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,440
committee and i am now a member

137
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,800
um i have successfully

138
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,639
passed interviews at um fang companies

139
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,520
big four investment banks cyber security

140
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,600
consultancy and a university obviously i

141
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,840
haven't done all of these jobs

142
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
but because i've been working on this

143
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,960
project for a few years i just took

144
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,800
every opportunity i could to

145
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,880
interview so i could pass this knowledge

146
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,160
on um

147
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,720
so yeah i i've done quite a lot of it

148
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,320
and this is all for

149
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,880
internships or entry level positions so

150
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,720
do please bear with that in mind

151
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,360
when listening to me apart from cyber

152
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,320

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,039
next slide please there we go so

162
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,280
um these are the types of interviews

163
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,039
that i have come across

164
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,880
uh i will be diving into a few of them

165
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,680
i will not be covering screening

166
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,479
behavioral

167
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,319
experience based group interviews or

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,759
assessment centers

169
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,400
there is lots of resources out there

170
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,840
about those

171
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,759
elsewhere and they're not really

172
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,759
necessarily specific to cyber in my

173
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,960
experience

174
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,080
um so but do bear in mind that these are

175
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,720
things that you may need to

176
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,240
look at when preparing for your

177
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,000
interview so it's not always just going

178
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,840
to be technical questions

179
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,199
and that's all there is going to be a

180
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,600
lot more than just that um

181
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,840
but yeah if you would like resources for

182
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,080
any of those please let me know

183
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,600
um i will be talking about

184
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,440
technical interviews and coding

185
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,960
interviews and

186
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,880
a little about offering negotiation as

187
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,039
well

188
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,240
um but before i go into those in detail

189
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,000
i'm going to do a little bit about

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
interview preparation

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,919
so um if you let's say you've got a date

192
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:02,960
for your interview

193
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,840
uh you're a little excited um i want to

194
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,240
share

195
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,160
what steps i think you can take to

196
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,560
maximize your chances of getting the job

197
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,599
the first step is don't panic um

198
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,840
i found these things very very stressful

199
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,639
and i i know that a lot of people do

200
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,680
um yeah so the number one thing i think

201
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,160
for me

202
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,319
is learning to manage stress and that's

203
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,440
actually something that's quite

204
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,120
individual to everyone

205
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,919
so i really recommend spending some time

206
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,919
and reading up on how to do it and

207
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,960
figuring out what methods were for you

208
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,520
um but the other main things that you

209
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,280
can do for interview prep

210
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,360
is practice practice practice and know

211
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,960
your stuff so

212
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,199
in terms of know your stuff i found that

213
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,039
with each subsequent subsequent

214
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,000
interview

215
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,280
i've done better and that's because the

216
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,039
best way to learn something in my

217
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:53,599
opinion

218
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,960
is to just do it and this is a really

219
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,800
kind of chicken and big chicken and egg

220
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
problem for entry level

221
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,039
people in cyber security because how do

222
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:03,680
you get

223
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,840
good at cyber security for your first

224
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,080
job if you don't have that first job

225
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,720
right

226
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,440
so in my opinion the best way to do that

227
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,639
is to do

228
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,800
side projects you know do some coding on

229
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,759
the side

230
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,840
uh watch some def con talks attend

231
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,759
conferences like this

232
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,800
um use udemy coursera maybe contribute

233
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,319
to open source

234
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,039
uh you can also find a mentor and ask

235
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,479
them to help you

236
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,000
uh play cts do some talks in general

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,640
just gain

238
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,719
experience in any way you can and you

239
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,559
can really get creative with this kind

240
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,279
of thing

241
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,000
uh your your ex my first experience in

242
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,279
infosight wasn't

243
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,440
really to do with a job specifically it

244
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,000
was just to do with some side projects

245
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,360
um so um yeah but this

246
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,440
this kind of this portion of things does

247
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,480
get easier

248
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,959
the more internships or jobs you do so

249
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,880
don't worry you will get better

250
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,200
um and then the second thing is practice

251
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,080
so interviewing in my opinion is a skill

252
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,120
in its own right um so i know

253
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,040
people with loads and loads of knowledge

254
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,880
that can't really communicate

255
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,279
that well and i think that puts them in

256
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,800
a real disadvantage in terms of

257
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,240
interviewing because

258
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,959
that's one of the most important things

259
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,920
so

260
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,200
i think the best way um to practice for

261
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,080
interviews

262
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,160
is to identify the types of questions

263
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,600
you think are going to be

264
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,080
asked and then to practice with your

265
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,200
friends

266
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,080
um and yeah just make sure that you're

267
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,880
able to

268
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,000
to say what you want to say because i

269
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,920
at least find that even if i have the

270
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,839
knowledge speaking about it

271
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,200
is a totally different story um

272
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,680
if you don't have friends that you feel

273
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,720
comfortable

274
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,279
practicing with you can reach out on

275
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,480
twitter to

276
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,320
the cyber security community and i'm

277
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,080
sure you'll find somebody to help

278
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,600
if i can help i will just tweet me um

279
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,360
but obviously i might not be qualified

280
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,560
uh so i'm sure that we can find somebody

281
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,240
who will be willing to practice with you

282
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,480
if you need it

283
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,279
um right another kind of tip that i

284
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:11,680
found

285
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,720
helps and i will caveat this with

286
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,920
i've done this for various companies and

287
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,720
it doesn't

288
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,880
actually always work in terms of the

289
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,480
actual questions

290
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,920
but um but the themes that emerged were

291
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,839
definitely in the interview so

292
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,240
there's a website called graph store

293
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,200
that i'm sure

294
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,279
at least some of you are familiar with

295
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,800
and people will

296
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,480
actually post interview questions from

297
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,079
specific companies

298
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,240
um there so you can just use the search

299
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,120
function

300
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,640
to look for the company name and

301
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,720
interview questions um

302
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,120
there tends to be a lot for software

303
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,320
engineering

304
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,800
um for bigger companies not necessarily

305
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,160
for cyber security

306
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,680
but there are some um and obviously

307
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,519
use your critical thinking like you're

308
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,200
probably not going to

309
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,600
have to you know reverse a linked list

310
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,640
or anything

311
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,800
uh in a cyber security job interview

312
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,560
although it might happen

313
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,880
uh but yeah this is a good resource and

314
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,839
obviously

315
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,120
it's going to work much better for

316
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,959
bigger companies

317
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,640
but yeah just check it out it's it's a

318
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,519
good place to look

319
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,120
i'm sorry um

320
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,560
now the next thing is uh kind of

321
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,480
looking at the job description so

322
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,279
um geography job descriptions can be

323
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,720
very vague

324
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,760
um and a lot of them actually have a lot

325
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,560
more in the description that is actually

326
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,200
required from you once you get to doing

327
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
the job or even the interview

328
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,399
so don't let yourself be intimidated by

329
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,040
the job

330
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,480
descriptions but i do suggest being able

331
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,040
to talk to all the kind of keywords

332
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,160
in a specific job profile it won't hurt

333
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,440
to learn about these things if you

334
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,639
haven't heard of them

335
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,639
oh and i guess this should go without

336
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,639
saying but if this is what's deterring

337
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,200
you from

338
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,760
applying for a job um please don't let

339
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,200
it like

340
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,639
there's a lot of research that shows

341
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,320
that women for example don't apply to

342
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,079
jobs where they don't um

343
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,760
fulfill every single requirement in

344
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,240
their job descriptions and men do so

345
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,079
yeah keep that in mind a lot of people

346
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,639
will so you might as well

347
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,800
um yeah so here obviously you can see a

348
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,079
kind of breakdown of

349
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,720
the things that i would look at um in

350
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,519
this kind of job description

351
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,040
i'm not going to read out the slides

352
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,639
because you're all

353
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,120
able to read but when looking at this i

354
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,760
would also

355
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
try and think about a few additional

356
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,200
questions like

357
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,399
um what the company's threat profile is

358
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,680
what their tech stack is um and

359
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,040
kind of you know use this as a base to

360
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
identify other questions that you might

361
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,079
be asked

362
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,880
in your interview

363
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,519
so the next thing i'm going to talk

364
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,279
about

365
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,320
is the kind of knowledge needed for most

366
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,040
of these interviews so

367
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,480
um this i mean this is not nowhere near

368
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,120
perfect

369
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,639
but um in my experience all of these

370
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,519
topics

371
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,680
will probably come up at a certain point

372
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,959
in the interview

373
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,880
so i'm gonna start at the bottom of this

374
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,079
pyramid so

375
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,120
the low level ones and zeros so um at

376
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,720
each level i would ask

377
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,519
uh can i use this and do i know how this

378
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,399
works

379
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,240
so in terms of low level ones and zeros

380
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,800
in my opinion that's um

381
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,639
asking questions about how computers

382
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,240
actually work so

383
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,880
everything from computer architecture to

384
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,360
actually

385
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,120
you know i don't know binary and

386
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,279
more importantly being able to use this

387
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,360
information so

388
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,120
maybe you're able to convert i don't

389
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,720
know hex to binary or

390
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,680
something simple like that but um do you

391
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,399
know why

392
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,360
you would need to do that um in in the

393
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,800
context of your job um

394
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,279
so the next thing is operating systems

395
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,000
so

396
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,720
not only how to use things like you know

397
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,480
linux windows mac

398
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,000
but also how they work um so then

399
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
obviously this is a very

400
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,120
challenging question you know how does

401
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,800
windows work could take

402
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
i mean there's books written about it

403
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,880
right uh but having a kind of

404
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
overview of it and being able to talk to

405
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,639
at least a little bit in my opinion is

406
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,839
really good

407
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,519
um the next thing is networking

408
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,000
so how does the internet work i i'm

409
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,920
going to share a really good resource

410
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,680
for answering that question

411
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,600
later on in the slide so stick around

412
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,839
for that um

413
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,199
but um yeah but apart from how it works

414
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,720
and talking about um being able to use

415
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,920
networking so you know can you set up a

416
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,519
little server in python um

417
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,839
and in general just you know

418
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,680
understanding

419
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,720
what happens in networks next thing

420
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,480
attacks defenses detections

421
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,240
um so this is getting trickier to

422
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,760
generalize because it's very

423
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,800
job specific um obviously blue tumors

424
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,040
red teamers etc will have

425
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,839
will get different questions but in

426
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,120
general

427
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,959
um you know in the context of the

428
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,720
company or the technologies that you're

429
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,839
going to be using

430
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,360
can you identify explain mitigate

431
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,320
exploit detect various attacks i think

432
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,120
is

433
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,160
um a really useful question to ask

434
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,440
yourself

435
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,800
when preparing for an interview

436
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,680
um the next one is tools so if there's

437
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,880
any tools mentioned

438
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,199
in the job description obviously being

439
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,320
able to talk about

440
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,560
what they are if you've used them before

441
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,079
or if you've had a chance to kind of try

442
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,440
out a demo version

443
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,000
being able to talk about that and

444
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,959
sometimes

445
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,279
talking about how the tools actually

446
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,160
work

447
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,360
um are both um important in my opinion

448
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,800
i've come across a lot of those

449
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,079
questions

450
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,560
um and then at the top of the pyramid

451
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
there's like job specific stuff now

452
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,680
obviously

453
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
i can't really predict that that will

454
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,000
probably be based on what's in the job

455
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,120
description

456
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
um but you know there will be other

457
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,560
stuff apart from

458
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,480
general concepts that you will be asked

459
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,120
most likely

460
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,600
um a little note about approaching

461
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,040
technical interviews

462
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,000
um so for me the biggest learning curve

463
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,600
here was that the interviewer is

464
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,399
actually human and that not knowing

465
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,000
everything is fine

466
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,240
um if you come across a question where

467
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,759
you don't know the answer

468
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,519
i that doesn't mean you're not going to

469
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,519
get the job um

470
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,560
and practicing your stress management at

471
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,480
that point is probably key

472
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,639
um it's really good to kind of give it a

473
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,480
guess making it clear that this is a

474
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,320
guess saying something like i don't know

475
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,199
but

476
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,160
based on my knowledge of x y and z i

477
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,720
think

478
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,800
this is how you would solve it or this

479
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,399
is the answer

480
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,319
um yeah a lot of interviews are about

481
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,199
testing your the depth of your knowledge

482
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,559
and

483
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,119
in this case there is going to

484
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,439
definitely be a point where

485
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,520
um where you have to say i don't know

486
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,679
and it's important to understand that

487
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,439
some interviews are structured like that

488
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,160
because

489
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,880
especially for junior positions you know

490
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,799
that your employer wants to know

491
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,599
your potential employer wants to know

492
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,640
how much you know

493
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,760
um and yeah once again they do not

494
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,360
expect you to know everything

495
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,760
um your thought process and logical

496
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,039
thinking is really important

497
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,280
whoops the next thing is coding

498
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,640
interview i've only had coding

499
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,400
interviews in two of the multiple

500
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,160
interviews that i've done

501
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,840
um a really good resource for learning

502
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,760
how to do them is hacker rank and leak

503
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,200
code if you haven't come across those

504
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,000
although i will

505
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,039
caveat that with um those are tailored

506
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,720
to software engineers and the questions

507
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,880
are usually a lot harder

508
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,240
um than what i have experienced even the

509
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,080
kind of easy level ones but it's a good

510
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,160
place to kind of practice them and look

511
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,600
at solutions

512
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,720
um cracking the coding interview is a

513
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,000
great book if you're going

514
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,760
in for a um you know development-focused

515
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,640
job

516
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,200
um i mean it's got a lot of information

517
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,480
it has a break of a book

518
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
i've skimmed through it and i have to

519
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,559
say that some of the stuff was

520
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,600
useful but um in general it goes into a

521
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,679
lot of details that i didn't really

522
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,720
personally need um and yeah i think

523
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,559
the last thing is like for cyber

524
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,720
security the coding interviews are

525
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,960
rare and they can be really challenging

526
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,039
but they can also be quite easy so

527
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,120
you know don't stress too much about it

528
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,960
um and but definitely

529
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,799
do you get some coding experience if you

530
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,720
want to go into cyber security because

531
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
a lot of big companies do ask that you

532
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,160
have at least a little

533
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,480
um another thing is asking your

534
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,160
interviewer questions so

535
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,080
um this is super important um

536
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,160
examples of questions that i would ask

537
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,120
are like

538
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,679
will i be the only woman on the team or

539
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,559
uh what is

540
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,039
the team like i like going into the

541
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,799
wikipedia for a company if it's a big

542
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,400
one and looking at the controversy

543
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,480
section and asking about that

544
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,440
um but that's um that might be a little

545
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,000
um cocky for some people i suppose

546
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,720
um but i think it's um it's a really

547
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,600
good

548
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,679
um opportunity for you to see if you

549
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,640
would actually enjoy

550
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,080
working with the person that's

551
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,919
interviewing you if they're gonna even

552
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,360
be on your team

553
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,320
um and you know if you care about

554
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,160
working from home for example

555
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,240
you should definitely ask about it

556
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,600
because some companies are really

557
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,280
flexible and some aren't

558
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,799
um good kind of on

559
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,640
on topic and timely question would be

560
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,480
how did they handle the coronavirus

561
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,520
celebrate

562
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,799
um i think it's just important to

563
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,440
remember that you are it's not just the

564
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,039
company that's interviewing you

565
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,960
you are also interviewing the company

566
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,799
and you have to

567
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,480
gauge whether you would like to work

568
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
there because it's a waste of your time

569
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,840
as well as theirs if you don't enjoy it

570
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,480
once you're there

571
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,159
compensation questions now uh i whoops

572
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:18,880
sorry

573
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,280
i'm not a lawyer so i

574
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,240
please don't ease this

575
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,039
please don't justify doing anything with

576
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,159
my slide

577
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,440
but it's really important in my opinion

578
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,799
to talk about salaries

579
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,280
um and put them online it benefits the

580
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,039
entire workforce to know what

581
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,840
we'll earn uh i know that it is taboo in

582
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,320
some

583
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,400
cultures especially in the uk for

584
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,240
example but i do think that it's

585
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,000
important to talk about it so

586
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,200
my two senses please do talk um also in

587
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,960
the uk it's illegal for a company to

588
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
tell you that a salary is confidential

589
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,520
under the equality act of 2010 some

590
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,480
companies do

591
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,799
i personally have chosen not to work for

592
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,559
a company that did that

593
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,640
um yeah i think it's really important to

594
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,000
know your rights

595
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,039
um in terms of kind of

596
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,880
you know asking for a salary it's always

597
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,159
good to ask the

598
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,760
company to give you a range first um

599
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,440
and if that doesn't work find a trusted

600
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,919
peer mentor to speak to

601
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,200
and i encourage negotiating uh

602
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,679
but it's good to have another offer if

603
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,000
you are going to negotiate

604
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,120
now resources all of these links uh i

605
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,919
would

606
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,919
i mean if you would like to scan them uh

607
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,520
with your phone please do

608
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,280
um otherwise hello lucas.com

609
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,400
[Music]

610
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,679
links i will have links to all of these

611
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,679
so the first question bank is just a

612
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,840
list of technical interview questions

613
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,679
the seven day preparation planner is

614
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,080
kind of a cute little

615
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,840
planner of things that you should do on

616
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,600
various days when you're preparing

617
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,080
the week before an interview then i've

618
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,120
got a non-technical question bank

619
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,799
ltr uh learning the ropes 101 is a book

620
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,919
by andy gill

621
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,440
this is a cool little primer to

622
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,720
red teaming jobs um i've read it i think

623
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,919
it's a really good resource

624
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,559
it wasn't that relevant to the things

625
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,600
that i was

626
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,280
being interviewed for because it's

627
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,600
mainly for fan testers and offensive

628
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,360
security professionals

629
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,760
but if you're into that side of things

630
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,440
definitely check that out and you can

631
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,000
get that for free or for a donation

632
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,400
um so yeah it's a good resource and then

633
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,080
the last one is what happens then this

634
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,440
is the resource i was referencing

635
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,159
whenever

636
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,679
i said um i was talking about networking

637
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,960
um this is a great place to learn about

638
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,480
how the internet works

639
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,760
answering that question um is

640
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,480
is difficult but reading through

641
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,039
everything that's in that github repo

642
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,600
is a really good way to start so

643
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,720
uh yeah final thoughts uh

644
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,760
bring the water to your interview uh i

645
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,120
think that's super important i've

646
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,039
forgotten to do that some a few times

647
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,480
and it wasn't good

648
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,600
um minimize stress on the day so

649
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,919
uh you know come early prepare your

650
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,679
clothes in advance etc

651
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,360
it's easy to forget these things

652
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,520
especially if it's your first interview

653
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,919
but just ensure that the only stress is

654
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,679
coming from the actual interview not

655
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,320
from any

656
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,520
external factors if you can um learn to

657
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,400
manage stress

658
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,640
i've already talked about that the more

659
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,480
interviews you do the better you will be

660
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,000
so i've done a lot and i've definitely

661
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,760
noticed that my confidence has gone up

662
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
and i've gotten a lot better at asking

663
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,880
questions so

664
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,520
in my opinion you know if you can you

665
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,880
don't want your first interview

666
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,640
to be for your dream job so yeah

667
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
i think it's really important to do as

668
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,760
you know as many as

669
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,159
your time allows for um and yeah

670
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,760
remember that the worst case scenario is

671
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,559
that you interview somewhere else

672
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,679
so with that

673
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,039
magic time so i'm gonna try and turn on

674
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,440
the camera

675
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,520
um there i am now i really hope that

676
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,919
people can see me

677
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,840
um would can is there any way i can find

678
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,640
out

679
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,039
if it's working i'll just go ahead and

680
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,279
ask can anyone see

681
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:32,000
the camera at this point in time

682
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,919
it's not yet okay okay

683
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,799
so people can

684
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,480
right um well how about

685
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,960
um so i what i was going to do is start

686
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,080
off by demonstrating

687
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,360
a magic trick um how about i

688
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,559
show you the agenda um

689
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,080
no could i help you could i have you

690
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,440
close your slides

691
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,840
that might help

692
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,679
there's some resources as well but for

693
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,159
now

694
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,799
this should work right so um

695
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,640
how about i start talking and then

696
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,840
i wait for maybe two minutes to see if

697
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,320
the

698
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,000
video pops up for more people um

699
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,880
so uh card magic i started doing card

700
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,279
magic when i was about 16.

701
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,559
um i learned to from first from

702
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,559
a friend and then from some books um

703
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,919
i think it's a really really cool quote

704
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,600
the organizer has stopped sharing your

705
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,919
webcam sorry

706
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,159
that was a misclick that is fine

707
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,360
i will try to reshare uh

708
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,480
can you stop sharing the slides oh

709
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,520
hey that looks a lot better okay

710
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,960
is that working uh

711
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,000
it looks like it might be for people

712
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,240
i personally can't see the video on the

713
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,000
train so i can't

714
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,240
be reliable but it looks like okay other

715
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,320
people say you're good

716
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,520
okay cool right so um

717
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,799
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

718
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,200
start off with a demo of some magic

719
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
tricks that i am not going to teach

720
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,640
because they might be a little too

721
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,159
difficult to teach in

722
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,559
15 minutes then i'm going to show you a

723
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,760
trick

724
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,640
with an assistant who uh which i'm going

725
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,000
to actually teach you

726
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,279
and then i'm going to share some

727
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,039
resources and final thoughts and if

728
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,799
there's any time left over i'll show you

729
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,000
some more tricks

730
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,200
um so i really hope people can see me

731
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,799
otherwise this really doesn't make any

732
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,080
sense but

733
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
um i'm going to tell you the story of

734
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,159
the first time i saw magic so

735
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,960
um long story but i was face painting

736
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
somebody who was playing with cards

737
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,320
and he was shuffling in

738
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,159
quite a few cool ways i had never seen

739
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,760
anybody shuffle cards professionally i

740
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,400
was

741
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,080
you know 16 at the time had never been

742
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,520
in a casino or anything

743
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,720
but he was doing all this cool stuff and

744
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,200
i was really intrigued and i thought it

745
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,480
would be awesome to like

746
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,000
learn that um so i was face painting him

747
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,240
so i told him that he should show me a

748
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,760
magic trick or i'll screw up

749
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,039
i'd say and he said fine um so he told

750
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,880
me to pick a card

751
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,399
so i did um it was not the four of

752
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,600
hearts

753
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,799
but for the purposes of this

754
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,960
demonstration that does not matter

755
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,440
so he took my four of hearts he put it

756
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,000
somewhere

757
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,679
into the middle of the deck like this

758
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,240
he snapped his fingers and the four of

759
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,399
hearts came up on top

760
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,960
i said yeah you're not tricking me mate

761
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,000
that's too easy

762
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,159
because you've just got two fours apart

763
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,840
so he told me to write my name

764
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,720
oh great my pen doesn't actually work

765
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,080
i've got another one that's fine

766
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,360
i've claimed prepared this one also

767
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,000
doesn't work

768
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,279
could you pass me a sharpie from overlap

769
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,279
thank you sorry

770
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,880
so i wrote my name on the card

771
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,880
and he showed me the trick again so he

772
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,600
took my fork

773
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,200
uh put it into the middle of the deck

774
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,440
like that snapped his fingers

775
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,720
and the card came off on top now i was a

776
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,159
little angry at this point because i

777
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,919
really don't know not knowing how things

778
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,440
work so i asked him to show me how it

779
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,240
actually works

780
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
and he said fine i will so what he did

781
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,159
was he bent the card from the side

782
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,279
i'll show you why it's because that

783
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,080
means

784
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,600
if it's bent you can kind of see the

785
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,840
card like that so he let me watch in

786
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,360
real time what actually happens when he

787
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,440
puts the rest of the deck on top so

788
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,880
he put the rest of the deck on top and

789
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,120
told me to pull the invisible string

790
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,840
at the top of the deck so i did one two

791
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,799
three

792
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,080
and i don't know if you can see that

793
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,320
well but that bank card actually came up

794
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,080
on top again

795
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,679
now uh i was impressed but i wasn't

796
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,480
pregnant i

797
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,640
did not enjoy being tripped and some

798
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,399
people don't which is fine

799
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,600
but i said find g something with a

800
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
different card so um

801
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,559
i picked a random other card oh another

802
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,480
four nice that was not on purpose

803
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,320
and he said you know what you picked

804
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,840
this for but i actually want to keep

805
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,200
going with the other one so he just

806
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,799
wiped the card like that and it turned

807
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,520
into my

808
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,640
original four now

809
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,799
um i don't know how you guys are feeling

810
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,919
about this

811
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,919
but i didn't like it um my last

812
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,880
um the last trick that he showed me was

813
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,640
actually to do with a number

814
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,640
so there are currently 250

815
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,440
attendees watching this so i'm gonna

816
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,399
take

817
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,000
two plus five which is seven so he

818
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,880
he asked me to rename a random number um

819
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,559
i would name a random number but it's

820
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,600
easy if it's me

821
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,200
but i'm just going to show you that if

822
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,279
you go one two

823
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,120
three four five six

824
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,799
and seven that card was actually my card

825
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,159
no um i

826
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,279
i was pretty impressed and i asked this

827
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,520
person to teach me something he said no

828
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,640
but then later on he got a bit drunk and

829
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,720
did teach me something so i went home

830
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,760
learned to message him on facebook

831
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,399
because this was a long time ago um and

832
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,520
and asked me to and ask him to meet up

833
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,240
with me to

834
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,279
to to watch what i had learned um

835
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,440
i showed him he said it was terrible and

836
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,960
taught me how to do it better and shared

837
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,760
some resources

838
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,960
the same ones that i'm gonna share with

839
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,080
you um so that was the demonstration i'm

840
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,679
now going to

841
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,360
just check how much time i have left

842
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,799
cool

843
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,960
i'm now going to teach you a card trick

844
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,840
that you can

845
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,519
prepare at home if you do have a deck of

846
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,760
cards please use it to follow along

847
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,039
you won't need the whole thing you can

848
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,640
just use half if there's like two of you

849
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,320
or something the whole thing is fine as

850
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,760
well

851
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,039
um so um this

852
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,679
trick is a kind of mind-reading trick

853
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,279
and i'm going to show you how it works

854
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,279
so i have an assistant here dan

855
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,799
right here so he's the person that i'm

856
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,080
going to

857
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,760
show the trick to so could you just pick

858
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,240
any part

859
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,240
cool no please remember it i'm gonna

860
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,679
turn around if you could show it to the

861
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,240
camera

862
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,080
and don't let me see it and then put it

863
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,000
back against your chest when you're done

864
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,159
so i can't see it and let me know when i

865
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,720
can turn back

866
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,120
okay cool so um

867
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,159
say stop wherever you like but right

868
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,840
into the top

869
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,439
right okay and put your card just there

870
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,760
so uh now i'm gonna just found the cards

871
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,880
out like this

872
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,679
and i would just like you to confirm to

873
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,640
um

874
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,279
the you know to the audience to me that

875
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,399
the car is in fact

876
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,720
the card rather is in fact somewhere in

877
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,760
this deck

878
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,039
they wait until the end or it's yeah

879
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,360
right no funny stuff yeah cool

880
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,279
i'm gonna give these a shuffle and i'm

881
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,799
gonna read your mind so

882
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,720
um i'd like you to imagine the cards

883
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,200
just here focus on it really hard okay

884
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,360
now don't tell me i'm going to say a few

885
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,240
things don't

886
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,840
respond i'm just going to read your

887
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,000
facial features and try and figure out

888
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,240
which part it was based on them right so

889
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,000
it's either a red card or a black card a

890
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,440
red card or a black card you're slightly

891
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,480
smiling when i say

892
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,600
red so i know it's a red card it's

893
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,159
either

894
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,240
a diamond or a heart a diamond or a

895
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,840
heart okay i know it's a diamond

896
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,919
because once again just like smile okay

897
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,760
in diamonds we've got easter king so ace

898
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,799
two three four

899
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,000
five six seven eight nine ten jack but

900
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,200
somewhere there

901
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,679
seven eight nine ten nine nine was it

902
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,120
the nine of diamonds

903
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,600
it was yay that's the trick and i'm

904
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,000
going to teach you guys how to do that

905
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,679
oh thank you i don't need you anymore

906
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,559
um so

907
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,159
um i really want to share how important

908
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,519
presentation is

909
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,799
and that's kind of why i chose this

910
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,480
chart because the method is actually

911
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,399
quite simple

912
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,640
it includes a little bit of misdirection

913
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,000
it doesn't include very much

914
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,519
card handling which is great for

915
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,919
beginners um

916
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,320
and then the fun part is kind of making

917
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,399
it into a mind reading trick

918
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,880
obviously i can't read minds nobody can

919
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,840
read minds

920
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,679
uh there is the concept of cold reading

921
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,039
you can go and learn about that i don't

922
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,799
know if i believe in it still

923
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,519
um but this is how the chart works so

924
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,120
you ask your audience member to pick a

925
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,840
card

926
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,320
let's say they pick this i don't get to

927
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,000
see it i don't have to see it

928
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,200
i'm just going to put it there then you

929
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,559
turn around ask them to look at the card

930
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,080
to memorize it make sure you tell them

931
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,039
to memorize it

932
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,799
you always have to be really explicit

933
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,000
about what you tell your audience

934
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,760
otherwise they won't do it

935
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,399
um so then you ripple through the parts

936
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,119
like this

937
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,280
and this might not be so simple for some

938
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,918
people i recommend holding the cards

939
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,520
like so so i'm over here

940
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,280
fingers like this if you've got smaller

941
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,560
hands

942
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,119
you can use uh bridge sized cards

943
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,960
instead of poker sized cards that's just

944
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,000
a wee tip

945
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,040
um but hold the cards like this and use

946
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,839
this finger

947
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,000
and this thumb to grab them there and

948
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,520
then use this

949
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,320
index finger to kind of riffle them up

950
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,960
you can also do things like this

951
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,480
or this but that's too difficult for now

952
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,199
so just do this and tell them to say

953
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,119
stop for every what they want

954
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,480
so they say stop here and now

955
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,839
i tell them to put the card here now

956
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,000
this is where the misdirection happens

957
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,839
so the way this trick works

958
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,079
is that i remember a key card this is

959
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,839
the card that is going to be on top

960
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,040
of the other card and whenever so

961
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,119
if i show this to you with this card

962
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,960
face up so this is the secret card that

963
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,920
i don't know

964
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,240
so if i put this card face up i remember

965
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,680
the jack

966
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,480
which is here i put it on top of the

967
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,440
deck

968
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,640
then when i shuffle through what i'm

969
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,079
looking for

970
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,520
is this jack and i know that the card

971
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,599
next to it is going to be the secret

972
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,119
card

973
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,040
so let's try that again

974
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,599
so this is the selected card of course

975
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,640
my card

976
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,320
uh this is the select card i say

977
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,040
oh sorry i've got a little confused with

978
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,560
the cards there

979
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,920
cool um i say say stop

980
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,800
they say stop this is my key card i say

981
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,079
place the card here

982
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,599
and this is a really important move

983
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,760
because you're hiding the fact that

984
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,000
you're

985
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,119
looking at this card by pointing

986
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,800
so you're going place the card here

987
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,960
because obviously you don't want to go

988
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,079
say stop they say stop and you go

989
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,480
okay put your card there because that

990
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,320
kind of gives the trick away so

991
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,280
you say place your card there they put

992
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,480
their card there

993
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,800
you put your card on top now if you're a

994
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,560
little advanced you can now

995
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,880
shuffle in a way that will not disturb

996
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,480
those cards in the middle so

997
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,079
a way you could do that is using an

998
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,640
overhand shuffle where you take

999
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,359
a bit of cards from the top all of the

1000
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,800
middle cards

1001
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,359
and then just shuffle the rest of them

1002
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,480
something like that

1003
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,880
but you can learn all about that in your

1004
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,240
time if you want

1005
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,760
um and then you're just searching

1006
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,079
through the cards and looking for your

1007
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,079
key card

1008
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,320
um and i know that my key card is the

1009
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,079
five of spades so i know that the four

1010
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,599
of hearts is then

1011
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,440
their card so what i've done at that

1012
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,520
point is and i asked them to verify

1013
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,440
that the card is in the deck right

1014
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,720
because your audience is always

1015
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,240
suspicious of what's going on

1016
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,240
and all i need to do is find out what

1017
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,680
card it is that they picked

1018
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,680
so at this point i know what the card is

1019
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,280
and now it's completely up to me how to

1020
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,400
play the

1021
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,320
mind reading thing if you want you can

1022
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,400
just take that card out and show it to

1023
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,000
them and say that's your card

1024
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,280
but that doesn't really build suspense

1025
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,480
and magic in my opinion so a better way

1026
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,079
to do it so i'm just checking the time

1027
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:22,640
here

1028
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,040
a better way to do it is to kind of put

1029
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,960
on your mind-reading hat

1030
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,520
and you know really go all out with the

1031
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,720
theatrics

1032
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,880
um it's up to you how you can do it you

1033
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,560
can use a pen and paper you can do what

1034
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,359
i did

1035
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,320
um you know you can hold up red objects

1036
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,599
and black objects is

1037
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,880
really up to you um right i've got four

1038
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,000
minutes left so i'm gonna

1039
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,040
switch over to my slides again

1040
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,800
and switch off my video

1041
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,079
can i find out if this that's

1042
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,400
working i see slides now

1043
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,400
cool right so yeah these are the

1044
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,079
the resources that i recommend so um

1045
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,400
in terms of free resources 52 cards and

1046
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,200
disturbing

1047
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,359
reality on youtube are really fantastic

1048
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,960
for teaching tricks

1049
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,480
and these two books the royal road card

1050
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,320
magic and that's card card technique

1051
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,359
are kind of the standard in terms of

1052
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,280
learning magic i really recommend the

1053
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,280
royal route card magic as the books that

1054
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,000
i

1055
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,560
um started with if you are going to buy

1056
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,520
it please buy

1057
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,800
from you know not amazon um

1058
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,920
i think it's about 12 pounds uh which is

1059
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,200
what 15

1060
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,000
or something like that um you probably

1061
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,880
can find

1062
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,000
um a free version somewhere not when i'm

1063
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,359
advocating for it but if you are

1064
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,880
strapped for cash

1065
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,960
you know there are ways um

1066
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,160
expert card technique is also great um i

1067
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,920
would start with the royal road first

1068
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,480
though

1069
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,960
and the royal road is really like

1070
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,000
standard uh

1071
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,920
i think anybody that's interested in

1072
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,119
learning magic should

1073
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,079
read that book um and most importantly

1074
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,680
practice what that book says

1075
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,800
um if you are rich you can also buy the

1076
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,359
video version of the royal root card

1077
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,400
magic

1078
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,280
um i've heard it's fantastic i have not

1079
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,200
bought it because it's about

1080
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,440
90 pounds which is you know over a

1081
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,800
hundred dollars so

1082
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,680
uh not for a student like myself um you

1083
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,160
can find

1084
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,359
links to these things at hella lucas.com

1085
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,839
links which you can see in the bottom

1086
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,279
left-hand corner of the slide

1087
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,079
um this study guide again the study

1088
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:38,720
guide

1089
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
again this isn't links i didn't make

1090
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,640
this this is something i found

1091
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,400
on the internet i didn't use the study

1092
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,079
guide when i was learning

1093
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,599
i'm not sure if it was around at the

1094
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,480
time but it's got a really

1095
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,800
good list of kind of basic techniques

1096
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,880
and shuffles and

1097
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,599
stuff like that that uh that you can

1098
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,079
learn

1099
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,200
uh if you're into this i would really

1100
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,760
recommend using the study guide and then

1101
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,720
buying

1102
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,040
uh the royal world card magic or doing

1103
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,240
both at once

1104
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,079
um the study guide covers some of the

1105
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,440
stuff the royal road does

1106
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,839
um a question i get a lot is what cards

1107
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,760
do i need so the cards i'm using are

1108
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,359
bicycle cards you will see a lot of

1109
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,800
magicians using these

1110
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,040
uh the reason is that they've got a very

1111
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,119
nice kind of coating which means they

1112
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,640
are easy to

1113
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,280
to fan and to shuffle and to kind of

1114
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,400
manipulate

1115
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,079
you don't have to use these cards by any

1116
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,000
means you will find

1117
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,680
the card handling a little easier if you

1118
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,560
do i think um one thing

1119
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,680
um to know uh if you are a student like

1120
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
me you can also get the bicycle

1121
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,520
seconds which are like the factory

1122
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,760
seconds they are significantly cheaper

1123
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,200
than the standard ones

1124
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,520
if you do get into this i mean you can

1125
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,880
go through about a deck

1126
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,359
like a week or something just if you're

1127
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,040
performing and you're destroying cards

1128
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,440
or you

1129
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,599
you know get the cards although i

1130
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,200
suppose with social distancing in place

1131
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,400
right now you're probably fine just

1132
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,680
using the standard ones because you

1133
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,119
won't be going out anyway

1134
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,720
um so yeah um but either of these works

1135
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,119
um you can also use just regular playing

1136
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,640
cards that you can pick up in any

1137
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,079
uh shop um but these ones will make your

1138
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:16,640
life

1139
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,599
easier and yeah i just wanted to share

1140
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:20,800
the reason behind

1141
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,640
people and magicians using these so

1142
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,720
often it's because of the finish

1143
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,280
they're just nicer to handle um they're

1144
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,079
not kind of

1145
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,280
magic in any way although you can get

1146
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,280
through that

1147
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,839
um final note this stuff is really hard

1148
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:36,960
uh you're building

1149
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,800
muscle memory in your hands that isn't

1150
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,079
something that you can just learn

1151
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,680
that is literally you know your body

1152
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,440
adapting to do things

1153
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,599
um you know you'll have to build

1154
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,680
strength in your fingers and

1155
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,560
stuff so yeah just give yourself time to

1156
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,359
learn that

1157
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,280
and i really recommend practicing

1158
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,560
presentation

1159
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,480
in front of a middle mirror and then on

1160
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,839
willing humans

1161
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,359
um you know it's it's it's easy

1162
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,280
ish well it's difficult to learn the

1163
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,800
tricks themselves but then it's a whole

1164
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,280
never

1165
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,119
another level of difficulty to learn how

1166
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,200
to present them in an entertaining way

1167
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,520
uh it's not something that i have really

1168
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,319
um

1169
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,800
practiced that much but the real like

1170
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,079
really good performers

1171
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,960
also know how to make most simple tricks

1172
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,119
into something that will blow your mind

1173
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,920
um watch the masters i've listed a few

1174
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,880
there

1175
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,440
um i think they're great and if you're

1176
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,880
just sitting around practicing

1177
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,319
watching somebody that is really really

1178
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,960
good at magic is very motivating

1179
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,680
um a lot of places will have local magic

1180
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,839
groups but obviously

1181
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,359
right now is probably not the best time

1182
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,680
to join them uh but yeah there's the

1183
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,000
international brotherhood of magicians

1184
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,960
um yeah brotherhood sad oh well um the

1185
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,920
magic circle

1186
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,440
university societies and meetup.com all

1187
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,480
will have local chapters in um

1188
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,079
or at least some of them will have local

1189
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,599
chapters um

1190
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,880
so yeah i recommend those um if you can

1191
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,920
at this time

1192
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,760
support your local magicians and magic

1193
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,560
shop haven't really figured out how

1194
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,720
especially your local magicians maybe

1195
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,400
pay them to teach you or something but

1196
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,680
yeah this is going to be a really hard

1197
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,440
time for the magic community

1198
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,440
uh because it's difficult to do the

1199
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,480
stuff of a video

1200
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,480
um and if you're not a cis fan this is

1201
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,079
your space too like they're

1202
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,480
the like women in cyber security are

1203
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,720
scarce women and magic are even scarcer

1204
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,440
like it is

1205
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,960
really bad so yeah please like

1206
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,640
feel welcome to be in that space um

1207
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,079
it's really important to have

1208
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,760
representation

1209
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,160
so i am out of time

1210
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,359
and yeah thank you for your time i can

1211
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,640

1217
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,119
uh one is asking do you like camera or

1218
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,240

1219

do you like kim kilo echo mic or copay

1221
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,000
charlie oscar papa echo golf uh

1222
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,839
cards i'm not familiar i assume those

1223
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,440
are brands

1224
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,280
i i'm not sure what that means so

1225
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,319
i'm sorry i don't know

1226
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,640
these things these things do happen uh

1227
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,760
and there's

1228
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,880
uh someone else uh

1229
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,440
seeing something about wax braiding is

1230
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,040
that something there

1231
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,800
wax braiding that might be to do with

1232
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,880
the finish on bicycle cards

1233
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,400
um it sounds like they could be what

1234
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,119
those cards are covered in but i'm not

1235
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:45,839
sure

1236
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,040
um i i i think it's clarification of the

1237
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,520
prior

1238
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,160
question apparently those kind are made

1239
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,200
from the plastic

1240
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,680
composite material uh i think the being

1241
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,640
the standard playing card type

1242
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,680
oh right okay yeah so plastic cards are

1243
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,240
great

1244
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,160
if you perform outside because they

1245
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,920
are more resistant to like water and

1246
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,520
stuff but um

1247
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,800
yeah for um for kind of inside

1248
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,040
and practice and stuff paper cards are a

1249
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,960
lot friendlier and they hurt your hands

1250
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,599
less as well which is nice

1251
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,560
