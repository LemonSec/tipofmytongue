1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,680
uh regardless of your opinion on

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,280
government surveillance we'll see what

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,440
encryption back doors are and how

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,560
they're made

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,720
they will learn how to uncover a back

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,920
door

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,320
and an ultra marathon is a race longer

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,639
than 26.2 miles

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,760
which is 42 and a bit kilometers uh this

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,320
section

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,320
could just be called running so we'll

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,080
learn how to run our first five

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,000
ten and a half marathon or ultra

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,599
marathon

15
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,320
uh and our presenter porter is a

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
software engineer in washington

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,719
dc uh so you're ready to uh present for

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,239
yes can everyone hear me awesome uh i do

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,280
in fact hear you

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,559
and uh pretty sure everyone else can at

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:43,760
this point so

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,719
without any further ado porter adams

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,559
with encryption back doors and ultra

24
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,399
marathon running

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,760
great thank you so let's get started

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,440
a summary of the talk um like you said

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,840
or like all of this conferences uh this

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,359
is an introductory talk

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,440
so i'm gonna keep it with as little

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,199
background knowledge as possible

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,040
encryption backdoors can involve a lot

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,360
of math but i will try to keep it a

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,280
level where everyone can understand

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,960
but because questions can get quite

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,000
technical uh just message me on twitter

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
and we're not gonna have a q a in the

37
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,240
first half and then in the second half

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,600
we'll talk about running

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,880
how to run your first 5k 10k however far

40
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,320
you want to go race

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,840
and then i'm sure there'll be some good

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,720
questions at the end of that

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,600
so let's start with what is encryption

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,400
so

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,439
encryption is basically the way that

46
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,560
secret messages are are made so

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,520
if you want to send a message and you

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,000
don't want

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,240
other people to read it then you can use

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,360
encryption

51
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,920
to go between the plain text which is

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,640
what your

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,960
actual message is and then you can send

54
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,479
a cipher text

55
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,719
over the network like in the mail like

56
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,920
over the internet

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,880
and this way anyone like who intercepts

58
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,479
that won't be able to read it

59
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,240
and then on the receiving end they can

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,640
decrypt back to the plain text

61
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,758
so in this case i took pancakes con

62
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,879
and um

63
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,400
encrypted it to mx because

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,160
i can't even say that and that's kind of

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,319
the point is that looking at ciphertext

66
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,360
you have no idea

67
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,800
what the plain text should have been

68
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,520
so a really old simple example of

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,160
encryption

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,000
is called the caesar cipher and

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
basically you take

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,760
any plaintext letter and you move it

73
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,560
backwards

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,120
three spaces in the alphabet so here we

75
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,680
see e

76
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,480
is moving backwards to b a was moved

77
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,920
backwards to x

78
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,440
and so that's how you get from a plain

79
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,599
text to a ciphertext

80
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,680
and then to decrypt from the ciphertext

81
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,360
you just move right back up

82
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,959
so it works the same way forwards and

83
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,959
backwards but it looks

84
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,120
pretty weird and actually the last

85
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
example i showed you

86
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,040
this is an example of a caesar cipher

87
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,080
and so

88
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,319
pancakes con turns into that you can see

89
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,120
the a

90
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,239
the second letter moves to x that has a

91
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,080
second letter

92
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,200
just like in this example

93
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,680
so the two big categories of encryption

94
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,280
uh there's symmetric key

95
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
and then asymmetric which i will call

96
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,360
public key cryptography

97
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,640
um starting with symmetric it's used

98
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,040
most of the time to actually encrypt the

99
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,319
real message

100
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,239
and encryption and decryption use the

101
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,319
same key so caesar cipher like you just

102
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:30,640
saw

103
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,080
is an example of symmetric key

104
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,400
cryptography cryptography

105
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760
is just the word for the study of all of

106
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,799
this

107
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,799
so i'll kind of use it interchangeably a

108
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,480
little bit

109
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,159
so let's look at another example of

110
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,560
symmetric key encryption

111
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,440
if we want to take the message high and

112
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,159
send it

113
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,360
across a computer one really good way to

114
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,000
do this

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
is to use what's called a one time pad

116
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,439
and so i'm going to explain all the

117
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,760
numbers in the screen

118
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,239
first computers don't store characters

119
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:02,879
as h

120
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,879
i they store it as zeros and ones so

121
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,480
just convert um

122
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,840
from ascii characters into binary and so

123
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,519
this binaries what you see is the plain

124
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,959
text that is

125
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,079
binary for high in ascii

126
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,358
and then how if you take this key which

127
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,320
is our encryption and decryption key

128
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,000
um 0 0 1 1 0

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,880
and so on um there's an operation you

130
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
can do it's basically just adding each

131
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,240
of these columns together

132
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,320
it's called xor it's adding without

133
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,440
carrying

134
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,759
um it's one way to think about it but

135
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,880
more or less you just

136
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,800
mash the plain text and the key together

137
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,320
and you get the ciphertext

138
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,240
and then to get back from the ciphertext

139
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,919
you just mash the ciphertext with the

140
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:46,720
key again

141
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,880
and you get back to the plain text so

142
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,560
here when we take hi

143
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,440
we mash it with this key we get a closed

144
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:53,919
bracket

145
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,240
and the letter e which doesn't look

146
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,360
anything like

147
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,199
the high that we originally sent and

148
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,960
then decryption works the same way

149
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
backwards

150
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,000
um public key encryption is

151
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,520
really cool if you've ever seen this

152
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
before i love it also

153
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,240
yes those are pictures of my dogs um

154
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,039
it's the same dog

155
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,840
uh so the the problem here the problem

156
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,759
with symmetric key cryptography

157
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,199
is it uses a key to encrypt and decrypt

158
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,400
which means that in this scenario here

159
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,759
let me explain the characters

160
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,000
we have alice on the left who's trying

161
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,520
to send a message to bob

162
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,800
on the right and but we have eve down at

163
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,479
the bottom who's listening in

164
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,880
eve is an eavesdropper you know it's

165
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,320
very clever

166
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,280
um so if alice wanted to send a message

167
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,960
to bob using the symmetric

168
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,720
key algorithm we just saw the one time

169
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,320
pad

170
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,639
the problem is alice and bob if they

171
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,360
haven't talked

172
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
to each other before they don't have a

173
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,639
key

174
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,639
to use for symmetric key cryptography

175
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,840
yet and if

176
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,039
alice tries to send bob a key then eve

177
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,720
is going to listen in and eve is going

178
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,680
to hear the key

179
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,600
the secret key and so eve will be able

180
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,039
to decrypt anything

181
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,360
that's encrypted with the secret key if

182
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,199
it's set in the first place

183
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,360
so it kind of seems impossible if you

184
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,880
first start thinking about it

185
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,560
if alice and bob are in like totally

186
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
different sides of the world or the

187
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,720
internet

188
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,199
that they could ever establish a secret

189
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,400
that eve would not be able to figure out

190
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,600
but there's a very cool idea um from

191
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,319
diffie and hellman in 1976 which is

192
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,120
basically

193
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,039
to separate the key into two pieces

194
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,080
which is commonly referred to as

195
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,120
the public key and the private key

196
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,520
uh i will keep calling the private key

197
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,319
just the key

198
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,319
and i will call the public key the lock

199
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,360
because i think it makes

200
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,160
a lot more intuitive sense for beginners

201
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,720
to

202
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,520
imagine a lock and a key so the basic

203
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,880
idea here is

204
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,199
bob can tell the whole world how to make

205
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,000
a lock

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,639
that only bob knows the key to and so

207
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,039
bob can tell everyone bob's lock

208
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,599
and then alice can use bob's lock to

209
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,880
encrypt the message with it

210
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,280
and send it back to bob now eve

211
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,880
listening in at the bottom

212
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,400
uh will not will know how to make bob's

213
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,280
lock

214
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,680
and we'll see something encrypted with

215
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,360
bob's lock but without bob's

216
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,120
key neither of those things is super

217
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,280
helpful and so eve will not be able to

218
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,720
read the message

219
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,240
so if you've never seen this before this

220
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,919
is super cool this is how

221
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,319
you can like access your bank online you

222
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,840
can put your credit card into

223
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,960
websites and things because this allows

224
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,840
you to set up

225
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,560
a secure connection between you and

226
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,199
amazon

227
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,639
or your bank and everywhere else and

228
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,160
it's pretty simple but it's kind of

229
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,440
magical when you think about it

230
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,000
so let's get into details my talk what

231
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
is a back door specifically an

232
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,160
encryption back door

233
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
basically it's a master key or a

234
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,360
skeleton key

235
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,599
and it can open any of the locks and

236
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,120
read any of the messages

237
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,000
so if alice has her own lock and key bob

238
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,919
has his own lock and key carol has her

239
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,520
lock and key

240
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,479
a back door would be able to open any of

241
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,759
the messages

242
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,120
sent to alice bob or carol regardless of

243
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,400
which lock and key they use

244
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,160
so let's do a little bit of history

245
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,759
lesson uh

246
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,199
in 1993 the nsa designed a phone chip

247
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,759
called the clipper chip and it was meant

248
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,680
to be an encryption device for phones

249
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,319
everywhere

250
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,320
but it came with a built-in back door

251
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
which basically when they created these

252
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,958
chips

253
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,000
the chips have the the private key on

254
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,880
them

255
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,360
and it would send a copy of that private

256
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,719
key the

257
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,640
company making the chips send a copy of

258
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,720
the private key to the government

259
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,399
and so the government would just have a

260
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,640
giant database of everyone's private

261
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,519
keys

262
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,800
so that they could um read or any of

263
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,320
your text messages or listen to any of

264
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,200
your phone calls

265
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,920
if they wanted and this poster on the

266
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,560
right

267
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,360
was created by rsa company they did a

268
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,920
lot of

269
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,560
the public pushback against the clipper

270
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,440
chip

271
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,760
and it ended up like not being used very

272
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,640
much

273
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,959
uh the crypto wars were the whole like

274
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,399
there's a whole series of debates in the

275
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,959
90s about like the uses of encryption

276
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,720
and that could be a whole talk in itself

277
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,080
but that's not what my talk's about

278
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,959
so secrets are no fun for governments

279
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,720
governments love being able to read

280
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,080
everyone's messages uh especially

281
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,880
other government's messages so if you

282
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,680
think about it

283
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,839
even if a government knew how to make

284
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,360
safe encryption

285
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,480
would you tell like your enemies how to

286
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,720
keep secrets from you

287
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,519
and the answer is certainly not as we'll

288
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,519
see in our next slide

289
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,640
there is a company called crypto ag

290
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,839
is a swiss company i'll say swiss and

291
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,200
quotes for now

292
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
that sold crypto machines to over 120

293
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,399
countries from 1970 to 2018

294
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,480
and um in 1995 hans buehler

295
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,519
was arrested uh by the government of

296
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,560
iran

297
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,440
because they suspected that he was

298
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,320
leaking

299
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,160
um these crypto machines are supposed to

300
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,200
keep all of your messages safe and iran

301
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
was pretty suspicious that hans buehler

302
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,320
was leaking

303
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,600
uh the message keys or intelligence

304
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,240
somehow

305
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,160
to uh the cia and the nsa

306
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,000
hans buehler was the salesman he was the

307
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
top salesman actually so apparently he's

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,360
pretty good at it because he sold these

309
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,920
machines to 120 other countries

310
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,839
um but after nine months of

311
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,360
interrogation it's pretty clear

312
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,240
that he didn't know anything about

313
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,519
connections with the

314
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,800
cia or the nsa but

315
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,480
they were right to be suspicious because

316
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,160
it was revealed just last month that

317
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,600
this company has been owned

318
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,880
the whole time by the cia and the bnd

319
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,560
and bnd is the german equivalent of it

320
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,079
so basically the entire rest of the

321
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,160
world had been counting on

322
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,720
the cia and the b d to keep messages

323
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,640
safe which they were not doing they were

324
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,279
selling

325
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,959
backdoored machines so let's look at how

326
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:15,680
you would actually

327
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,880
create one of these encryption backdoors

328
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,519
uh the idea is generally to insert a

329
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,279
hidden mathematical weakness

330
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,120
in it so that anyone else

331
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,040
if you don't know the weakness it's

332
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,640
pretty it's pretty tough

333
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,040
to decrypt the message but if you do

334
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,000
know the weakness

335
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,399
then you have your secret back door and

336
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,120
they're two

337
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,519
good places to hide your

338
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,320
secret weakness uh the first is to rig

339
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,399
at the key generation algorithm

340
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,839
which is the algorithm used to like

341
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,000
create the keys in the first place

342
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,600
so if you know what the keys are going

343
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
to be ahead of time

344
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
then like the rest of the encryption

345
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,680
doesn't matter because you just have the

346
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,680
keys and you're good to go

347
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,160
the second way that we could create a

348
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,959
back door

349
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,279
is to rig the encryption algorithm to

350
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,320
not really depend on the keys too much

351
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,560
and i'll explain that more in our second

352
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,760
example

353
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,600
the first example we're going to look at

354
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,200
rigging

355
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,880
sort of before the key generation

356
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,480
algorithm

357
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,560
so the dual ec drbg

358
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,880
uh i hate acronyms but there's one for

359
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,680
you

360
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,480
as a 2006 standard published by nist

361
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,200
which is a

362
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,639
pseudo-random number generator um

363
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,560
lots of cryptography and encryption

364
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,240
depends on

365
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,480
random numbers or numbers that look

366
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,399
pretty random

367
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,680
and this particular algorithm generates

368
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,519
random numbers using structures called

369
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,880
elliptic curves

370
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,639
and you can see one on the right it's

371
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,120
the the curvy thing

372
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,600
and um importantly basically

373
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,880
moving around elliptic curves you can

374
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,399
think of just bouncing around between

375
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,120
points

376
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,360
so if we start with a point p and a

377
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,880
point q

378
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,920
we can through some cool math

379
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,560
consider or call it like adding points p

380
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,519
and q together

381
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,839
in this weird way and the way you do

382
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,600
that on elliptic curves is you draw a

383
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,120
line through p and q

384
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,360
hits the curve at another point up at

385
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,320
the top

386
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,880
and then you reflect it over the x-axis

387
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,000
the exact reasoning for that

388
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,360
doesn't really matter for this talk

389
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,440
basically you can just think of it as

390
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,519
take points p and q and you can bang

391
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,200
them around and you get out

392
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,120
something that's pretty random um

393
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,320
importantly though we're trying to

394
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,720
generate a pseudo-random number

395
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,079
and from bouncing around between these

396
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,720
elliptic curves we're going to get a

397
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,600
point

398
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,680
and so the way we get a random number

399
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,120
from the point is we just look at the

400
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,560
x-coordinate

401
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,240
we don't want the whole x coordinate

402
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,720
because maybe like the exact points not

403
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,600
totally random

404
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,360
so what they do is they just chop off

405
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,600
the first like 18 bits

406
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,720
of the x coordinate and there's your

407
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,600
random numbers

408
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,199
so they're kind of two halves the first

409
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,040
half is bouncing around points

410
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,760
second half is chopping off a little bit

411
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,680
chopping off the first couple bits

412
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,839
so the next slide is going to look scary

413
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,199
but i think you're going to be able to

414
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,320
understand it once i

415
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,079
explain it so first let's look at state

416
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,920
update and bit generation those are the

417
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,440
two halves i was just talking about the

418
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,240
state update

419
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,320
is bouncing around and the bit

420
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,839
generation is

421
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,040
the truncating the 16 bits off the x

422
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,639
coordinate

423
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,720
so if we look at that green arrow down

424
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,160
at the bottom on the right half we're

425
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,120
gonna look at the right half of this

426
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,480
diagram first

427
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,519
um by the way this whole diagram is from

428
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,399
uh a presentation at crypto 2007

429
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,680
basically explaining

430
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,600
how all of this could be used for

431
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,800
backdoor

432
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,560
um and i'm taking their one hour

433
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,160
presentation and explaining it in like

434
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,600
three minutes

435
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,720
but the right half we are

436
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,440
truncating 16 bits off the x coordinate

437
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,040
the thing to remember though

438
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,680
is a lot of these numbers for encryption

439
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,040
are really big

440
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,399
so typically like hundreds of bits long

441
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,480
so removing 16 bits from like a 500 bit

442
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,000
number

443
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,480
isn't hiding very much of it and it's

444
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,000
pretty easy

445
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,440
to undo those and figure out like what

446
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,279
the real point was

447
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,880
because it has to be on the actual

448
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,399
elliptic curve

449
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
so the green arrow is pretty easy for

450
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,600
anyone to undo

451
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,160
and that's not necessarily a problem by

452
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,720
itself

453
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
that's not completely a back door we

454
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,480
can't undo everything

455
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,480
unless you can also undo this red arrow

456
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
so this red arrow there are a lot of

457
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,240
symbols in here but really all i want

458
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,600
you to look at is the

459
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,040
the p and the q and remember when we're

460
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,160
on the elliptic curve

461
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,480
you start with the p and the q are your

462
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,279
two kind of

463
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,360
base points and then you bounce around a

464
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
bunch of times

465
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,199
but if you pick those p and q carefully

466
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,240
like

467
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,360
they affect like everything else and so

468
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,639
the suspicion here

469
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,839
is that the nsa carefully selected this

470
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,079
p

471
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,120
and q to be related in a way that

472
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,000
they can undo this whole algorithm

473
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,040
um right so that's it

474
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,320
uh let's move on to our second way

475
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,519
of creating encryption back door

476
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,920
that was rigging pseudorandom numbers so

477
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,959
if they can

478
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,880
predict if you think you have random

479
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,480
numbers but they actually know exactly

480
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,920
what you're going to have

481
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,199
they can find your key that way

482
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,959
the second way i want to show you is

483
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,240
creating encryption algorithm that

484
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,279
doesn't depend on the key very much

485
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,639
so we'll make actually an aes

486
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,160
like encryption system with backdoor

487
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,399
aes is the advanced encryption standard

488
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,839
it's used today

489
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,759
i personally don't think it has a back

490
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,440
door in it but

491
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,360
you could design something that's very

492
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,279
similar looking that does have a back

493
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,399
door

494
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,720
so the idea here is called preserving

495
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,799
linear partitions

496
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,359
preserving just keeping together

497
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,000
partitions just means splitting it up

498
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,359
so in this example i have for you um

499
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,439
i've simplified this a lot but if you

500
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,760
imagine moving from like

501
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,119
these plain text dots um and each one of

502
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,919
these dots

503
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,319
is sent to some sort of dot over on the

504
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,720
right in the cipher text

505
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,320
um ideally this should be random

506
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,559
and so all these dots and the plain text

507
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,440
should look

508
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,039
pretty spread out in the cipher text but

509
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,919
if you notice in the plain text there's

510
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,799
five

511
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,320
dots that are clumped together in the

512
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,039
top left and there's still five dots

513
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,559
clumped together in the top right

514
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,000
in the cipher text and then the one dots

515
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,880
stay like each of the quadrants it moves

516
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,080
around a little bit

517
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,240
but the quadrants stay separated and

518
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,360
the point of designing and

519
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,000
something like this is if i look at one

520
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,799
of these points in the cipher text

521
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,400
i kind of know like what area

522
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,039
like it came from in the plain text just

523
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,320
based on where it ended up

524
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,200
if i know like these quad which quadrant

525
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,120
goes to which quadrant

526
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,400
so because of this if i see

527
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,679
some random point in the ciphertext i

528
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,440
have a pretty good guess already at

529
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,799
where it is in the plain text

530
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,640
and i don't need to check every plain

531
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,080
text possibility

532
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,400
i only need to check like the plaintext

533
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,200
possibilities in that one quadrant

534
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,600
so what this means is regardless of what

535
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,720
key you picked

536
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,000
keys how it's actually going to move

537
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,080
around kind of within the quadrant

538
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,960
you're still stuck there uh regardless

539
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,799
of the keys this is what i meant when i

540
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,440
said like

541
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,120
the encryption algorithm doesn't depend

542
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,799
on the key very much is

543
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,240
you're allowed to use whatever key you

544
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,880
want here but

545
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,080
um you're going to be stuck kind of in

546
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,840
the same area

547
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,880
now in the actual paper this

548
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,400
whole concept is like it's a little more

549
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,160
hidden than this it's not as obvious as

550
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,120
quadrants

551
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,840
that's the idea

552
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,000
so we made it uh 20 minutes we

553
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,679
covered everything from introduction to

554
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,480
encryption

555
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,559
all the way up to government backdoors

556
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,880
and what's possible to maybe back door

557
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,240
today

558
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,280
um questions can get quite technical so

559
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,799
just ask me those on twitter and i hope

560
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,559
you learned something

561
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,039
because now we're gonna jump into second

562
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,080
half of the talk

563
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,320
which is running now if you know me

564
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,640
i actually i wouldn't call myself a

565
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,840
runner

566
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,280
i don't love running every day i

567
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,360
certainly don't run every day

568
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,480
and my point in this talk is

569
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,280
to hopefully motivate you and show you

570
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,799
that you can run like

571
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,159
a lot farther than you think you can and

572
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,640
it's you don't have to be like some

573
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,000
crazy person who wakes

574
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,320
up at 5am to go run like eight miles

575
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,440
before work to

576
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,120
get it done so first question is how far

577
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,640
do you want to go

578
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,400
uh you probably have an idea in your

579
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,919
head of roughly

580
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,120
where you're at 5k is about three miles

581
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,440
up to 10k up to half up to marathon up

582
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,720
to ultra

583
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,799
if you've completed one of those start

584
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,400
thinking about the next step up the

585
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,880
ladder

586
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,840
i'd say it's like pretty reasonable like

587
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,559
five step

588
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,360
ladder and you can you can make it up to

589
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,320
the next step

590
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,840
from wherever you are in about two to

591
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,640
three months if you want

592
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,039
um but generally preparation is kind of

593
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,000
all the same

594
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,039
you just have to scale um whatever

595
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,400
you're doing uh

596
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,760
the distance to to be what you want

597
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,080
uh this is a picture on the right of

598
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,440
maggie gutterall

599
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,559
she won the 2019 biggs backyard ultra

600
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,679
which is an ultra race where every

601
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,960
hour you have to run four miles and

602
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,440
if you don't complete four miles before

603
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,400
the hour's over

604
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,720
then you have to drop out and so this

605
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,880
race just goes on and on and on

606
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,919
and so she won by running

607
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,720
over 250 miles over 60 hours in a rail

608
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,520
so if you have any idea about like

609
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,120
what's humanly possible

610
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,720
as like how far a human could run like

611
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,200
250 miles is the limit and i don't think

612
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,600
any of us are coming close to it

613
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,919
so i think we're all gonna be okay

614
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,240
running like even just a marathon 26

615
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,880
miles doesn't sound so bad

616
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,039
when you look at what some of like the

617
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,760
really advanced people are doing

618
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,120
um so the first thing to do

619
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,440
i guess is to kind of benchmark and see

620
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
where you're at right now

621
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,480
but i wouldn't worry about it too much

622
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,600
if none of you know david goggins he

623
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,840
is an amazing guy and i would highly

624
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,120
recommend reading his book

625
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,679
can't hurt me um but basically

626
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,679
the first day he decided he wanted to go

627
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,120
out and do all these things

628
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,480
he ran about 400 yards from

629
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,919
like his driveway to the end of the

630
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,200
street and was too tired and like had to

631
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,880
go back home and three months later

632
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,559
and like a hell of a training cycle

633
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,159
later he

634
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,400
began like he tried out to be a navy

635
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,919
seal and

636
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,919
after a couple temps like he was

637
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,600
successful

638
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
so he went from being like able to run

639
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,440
only about 400 yards to being one of the

640
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,679
most fit people on the planet

641
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,320
um so if you ever need some like

642
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,360
motivation

643
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,360
um especially on like mindset and

644
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,720
believing in yourself

645
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,640
please read like can't hurt me or

646
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,280
anything about david goggins

647
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,320
um so for your first race

648
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,640
uh i say step one put it on the calendar

649
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,520
but right now

650
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,559
a lot of races are canceled uh like most

651
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,240
events are i guess that's why we're here

652
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,840
at pancakes con

653
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,120
um but still i do recommend

654
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,600
um even if you can't do an official race

655
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,840
just say like on this date

656
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,120
i am going to run

657
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,440
you run five miles if this is your first

658
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,679
time doing any of these things

659
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,679
don't you don't have to run the whole

660
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,919
time like please walk

661
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,400
please walk like as much as you want i'm

662
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,640
gonna talk about this more but

663
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,360
even now like when i'm running marathons

664
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,480
or ultras

665
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,960
the farthest i could go straight is

666
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,919
about five

667
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,600
miles and then i need to take like a

668
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,400
water break or walk for a little bit

669
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,919
and then i can get back up and keep

670
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,640
going after like some walking but

671
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,440
you don't have to be able to run 26

672
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,640
miles in a row

673
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,840
okay so when you're training

674
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,080
honestly just google search for couch to

675
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,039
5k or

676
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,159
couch 10k couch to marathon i i tend to

677
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,159
like those plans because

678
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,320
even though i i don't sit on my couch

679
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,279
too much like

680
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,440
those those training plans really do

681
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,400
take you from

682
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,960
zero to wherever you want to be at and

683
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,400
most of them only last

684
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,000
four to eight weeks if you wanted to be

685
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,279
really prepared there's 12-week ones uh

686
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,840
but what i find with the 12-week ones is

687
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,400
you kind of lose some motivation so i

688
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,039
recommend

689
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,919
finding about an eight-week plan at the

690
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,039
most

691
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,159
um also what this means is your goal

692
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,760
should be to run whatever your next

693
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,320
distance you want to be

694
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,559
in about four to eight weeks

695
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,919
biggest really the only mistake you can

696
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,440
make is injuries

697
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
do not get injured at any point during

698
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,960
this running

699
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,039
is not like super intensive it's just

700
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,159
long and it's just a lot but you know

701
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,360
your own body best

702
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,000
and you can probably tell if things

703
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,480
aren't

704
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,679
quite going right just stop before you

705
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,120
really get injured

706
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,919
and go take care of it go rest there's

707
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:10,880
none of these things

708
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,240
that like you couldn't do like an

709
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,919
another month if you need to like take

710
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,320
some time off to take care of yourself

711
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,799
um really that's the only thing that can

712
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,679
go wrong here

713
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,360
is an injury the next step

714
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,880
find your pace so in case you didn't

715
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,159
check the news in october

716
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,919
elliot kipchoge ran the world's first

717
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,600
sub two hour marathon

718
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,880
on october 12 2019 that's

719
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,840
crazy fast like if you

720
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,760
like but like i said earlier when i run

721
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,320
all these races the first time you're

722
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,760
doing any of these

723
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,159
do not even think about what your time

724
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,520
is your only goal

725
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,360
when you're doing a race for the first

726
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,559
time like a certain distance for the

727
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,360
first time is to complete that race

728
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,200
then if you want to go back and sign up

729
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,799
for a second or a third one

730
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,000
and you want to start improving your

731
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,240
time then go worry about it

732
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,960
but the first time you're doing it just

733
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,000
sign up

734
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,600
you're probably going to walk some of it

735
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,360
that's totally fine

736
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,159
might take you a while your goal is just

737
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,240
to get to the finish line

738
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,039
and then you're in like several years of

739
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,480
training if you want to try and

740
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,279
go a sub two hour marathon that's your

741
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,120
decision

742
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,520
uh so preparing for race day you don't

743
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,880
need to do anything special

744
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,760
until one to two hours before the race

745
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,159
uh

746
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,919
or one to two days before the race

747
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,200
excuse me

748
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,400
um in terms of like diet

749
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,440
food really like just

750
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,360
be healthy i mean drinking more water

751
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
always helps stay hydrated

752
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,559
um i like eating pasta the night before

753
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,880
fruit for breakfast the day of is

754
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,880
usually a good choice

755
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,360
don't eat nothing eating nothing is a

756
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
mistake

757
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,240
there was a one race um i ran

758
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
orange county half marathon where i did

759
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,640
not have breakfast beforehand

760
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,799
and it was not very fun

761
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,320
at least the first couple miles until

762
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,480
the rest station which i will talk about

763
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,080
in a second

764
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,200
uh on the slide so rest stations

765
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,520
are glorious i wish someone had told me

766
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,720
about these before

767
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,000
i ran like any of my races because

768
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,799
they're just these places like stations

769
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,760
along the way

770
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,320
usually every mile or every two miles

771
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,440
and they just have

772
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,159
water gatorade there's usually food

773
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,399
there's usually bananas and snacks

774
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,640
and so it's literally just like when

775
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,320
you're running and you're sweaty and

776
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,440
you're tired

777
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,799
and you've gone like a mile and

778
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,799
then one of these stations shows up it's

779
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:59,840
just a blessing

780
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,320
and it's like it's gonna be okay i have

781
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,440
water and food

782
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,520
i'll take a quick break and then you'll

783
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,960
be good to go again

784
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,039
uh i didn't really like no one told me

785
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,399
about these things beforehand

786
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,240
but it's honestly one of the best parts

787
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,600
of running

788
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,720
in official races uh the other good part

789
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,679
is that besides these official rest

790
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,480
stations

791
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
usually when you're running if you're

792
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,320
like through a neighborhood or

793
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,360
in a city there will be lots of people

794
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,159
cheering for you

795
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,760
just at their houses out in the

796
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,080
sidewalks

797
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,399
so i'll never forget there was a one

798
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,840
marathon i was running

799
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,679
where i think it was yeah this was the

800
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,200
orange county half again

801
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,360
uh there was this little kid there's a

802
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,240
family

803
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,159
um and probably like a six-year-old

804
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,880
had some i don't remember like a peanut

805
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,320
butter snack

806
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,840
basically he was standing in his yard

807
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,399
with some food like for the runners to

808
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,279
to come by and grab and so i was hungry

809
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,559
because remember i didn't eat breakfast

810
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,840
before this race

811
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,559
uh so i came by to grab a snack and he

812
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,320
pulled it away like the tray for me

813
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,240
i was like what's happening and he's

814
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,320
like you can't take this snack

815
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,919
unless you promise me you'll cross the

816
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,640
finish line and his little five-year-old

817
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,159
just like looked me dead in the eyes and

818
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,840
he wasn't gonna give me a snack unless i

819
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,600
promised him i'd cross the finish line

820
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,880
and i was like oh my gosh

821
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,919
well i really want the snack so

822
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,799
i guess i'm gonna finish this race i

823
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,159
think he knew that i was

824
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,840
having a tough day but so yeah i

825
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,919
took the snack five-year-old complete

826
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,120
the race and like

827
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,559
thinking about that the whole time was

828
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,039
well i can't quit now because

829
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,480
she promised that little five-year-old

830
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,200
kid that would cross the finish line

831
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,600
that's another uh i highly recommend

832
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,120
telling your friends that you're going

833
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,399
to do one of these things

834
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,039
sign up tell your friends because you'll

835
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,640
be thinking about that

836
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,480
if you're like let's say you're running

837
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,799
a half marathon and you're about mile

838
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,080
10 you still got three more miles to run

839
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,320
uh thinking about your friends and

840
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,679
remembering that you told them that you

841
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,360
would finish this thing

842
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,520
uh that's pretty powerful motivator

843
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,399
because you're not

844
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,679
you don't want to give up because you're

845
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,080
like well i did tell everyone that

846
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,000
i was going to finish this it'd be kind

847
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,480
of sad if i had to go back and

848
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,240
tell like let them down because you

849
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,919
don't like

850
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,320
it's easier to kind of like let yourself

851
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,080
down a little bit i think than it is to

852
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,640
to let your friends down and so telling

853
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,880
friends talking to friends about it is a

854
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,120
huge motivator you can even run races

855
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,000
with friends which is really fun

856
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
um so race day when you're actually

857
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,960
running and trying to complete the race

858
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,320
biggest rule i have is

859
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,760
don't think about how far the finish

860
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,559
line is the farthest i think about in

861
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,159
advance is like where the next rest

862
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,120
station is

863
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,720
because i'm highly motivated by snacks

864
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,760
um but it's just like

865
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,799
imagining running like even just like

866
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,159
five miles straight sounds terrible and

867
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:00,640
that's

868
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,799
a really far distance like five miles

869
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,320
pretty far on a car

870
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,200
you're trying to do it on your feet uh

871
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,720
so really all you should be thinking

872
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,440
about is

873
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,000
okay five miles that's really far but

874
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,799
can i go

875
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,640
one more mile right now like can i get

876
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,399
to the next race station

877
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,440
and just like break it up into chunks

878
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,279
and just as long as you can keep going

879
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,559
one more mile

880
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,720
you're gonna look up and soon enough

881
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,880
you'll be like at the finish line

882
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,679
other things like once you when you're

883
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,960
when you're trying to decide like how

884
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,159
far you really

885
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,919
need to run before these races um

886
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,399
i tend to my rule of thumb is i need to

887
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,519
have run about

888
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,880
half of the race distance during

889
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,840
training

890
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,679
so when you look at these like training

891
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,880
schedules um

892
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,880
all of none of them like if you're

893
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,799
training for a marathon

894
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,120
you don't have to run 26 miles before

895
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,480
you run a marathon

896
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,279
uh in fact oftentimes the longest run

897
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,200
you do before a marathon is only about

898
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,399
20 miles so that extra six miles of

899
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:04,880
boost

900
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,360
really just comes from being hype on

901
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,240
race day

902
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,640
and being excited that you're there and

903
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,159
running with all the other people

904
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,519
and having people cheer you on and

905
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,559
it's it's kind of amazing but

906
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,279
you don't need to have trained all the

907
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,159
way up to a

908
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,320
26 mile race before doing a 26 mile race

909
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,320
i train about halfway so if i can run

910
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,279
about a 13-mile race without too much

911
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,559
trouble

912
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,760
then i'm ready for the marathon and

913
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,080
if you can run like a 5k without too

914
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,960
much trouble

915
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,159
you're ready for a 10k so that's my

916
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,440
that's my rule of thumb

917
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,600
is if you can complete half of it you

918
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,159
can complete the whole thing

919
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,480
and the last step is celebrate when

920
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,600
you're finished

921
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,960
and you're all done it's exciting it's a

922
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,679
huge accomplishment it feels great

923
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,120
usually when you cross the finish line

924
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,120
they have more snacks more treats

925
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,880
and like goodie bags and things to give

926
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,559
you

927
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,799
this is a photo of me running thank you

928

929
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,360

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,399
and uh thank you pancakes khan for

i hope i do okay on time here uh

935
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,559
i've got time yeah oh yeah you've got uh

936
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,120
you've got

937
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,159
like 10 minutes or so still all right

938
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,679
there are a couple of questions that

939
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,799
have showed up

940
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,320
um this one person asks

941
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
so how do i keep myself occupied during

942
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,000
the long run do you have any tips

943
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,320
yes so how do you keep yourself occupied

944
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,519
some people

945
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,240
are love and just swear by listening

946
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,760
music the whole time

947
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,159
put together like giant music playlist

948
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,240
of all your favorite songs

949
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,760
and i know a lot of people who um

950
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,240
like listen to podcasts or just listen

951
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,360
to their favorite playlist

952
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,640
personally i i enjoy the time

953
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,839
kind of in my own head and

954
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,879
i like using that time spent running

955
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,199
to just kind of think about like really

956
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,800
whatever comes into my head

957
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,000
sometimes about friends wherever

958
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,800
else i'm going on life like maybe it's

959
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,520
about dinner

960
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,960
with the food that's coming next um

961
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,000
because it is a long time

962
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,639
just in your own head and especially

963
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,560
this is one thing for all the treadmill

964
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,239
runners i think it's actually harder if

965
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,079
you're on a treadmill because you're

966
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,679
the scenery's not changing you're not

967
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,199
seeing anything new

968
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,800
if you do run outside one it's like

969
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,960
it's way better on your knees and things

970
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,239
um

971
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,320
it's better to like avoid injuries but

972
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,399
two you get to like go see the sights

973
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,399
and explore around and

974
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,480
you can go visit like neighborhoods

975
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,160
nearby or find like

976
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,119
actual running trails so this picture is

977
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,280
actually like halfway up a mountain

978
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,320
my friend and i went and like we

979
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,880
we ran just to find this waterfall but

980
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,480
all along the way they're really cool

981
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,520
sights

982
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,079
and so mostly i was just thinking about

983
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,920
like wow like look at these trees look

984
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,000
at this nature

985
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,640
so it's it's kind of up to you on how

986
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,920
you want to spend the time

987
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,240
in your own head or if you don't like

988
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,599
spending time in your own head by

989
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,880
yourself then i recommend

990
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,160
listening to music or podcasts

991
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,400
fantastic all right and another

992
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,280
participant

993
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,440
asks is there any cross training that

994
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,320
you recommend

995
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,599
during training besides running

996
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,960
yes so cross chaining is great because i

997
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,200
personally i i should have covered this

998
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,040
actually thank you for this question

999
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,960
i like i mentioned at the beginning of

1000
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,400
talk don't love

1001
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,520
running every day um it's just

1002
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,200
not my favorite thing to do i played

1003
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,960
soccer growing up so if you put a soccer

1004
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,000
ball in front of me i'm a lot

1005
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,359
happier um but cross

1006
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,800
training really i would just say like

1007
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,640
look at about find your pace find a

1008
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,320
we're gonna a couple steps here find

1009
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,720
your pace for how fast you can run

1010
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,000
about a mile and then like multiply that

1011
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,599
and add a little bit of time to find

1012
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,599
like approximately how long you plan to

1013
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,760
spend running this race

1014
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,839
and that's like the time that it's gonna

1015
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,280
take to complete the race

1016
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,680
that's what you should be thinking about

1017
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,119
for cross training

1018
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,280
so when i ran my first marathon it took

1019
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,040
me about five hours

1020
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,839
which means that i had to be prepared

1021
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,599
with cross-training to do

1022
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,119
something for five hours so i really

1023
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,200
don't think it matters if you do a dance

1024
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,800
class for five hours

1025
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,240
if you do go on a bicycle for five hours

1026
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,520
if you wanna join a gym or swim

1027
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,960
or any other kind of like

1028
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,599
intense like cardio training whatever

1029
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,400
you do

1030
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,119
just think about how like the amount of

1031
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,320
time

1032
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,800
and you can you can build a whole

1033
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,000
training schedule

1034
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,160
just off of dance classes if you want

1035
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,800
so it's the duration that matters more

1036
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,160
than anything else

1037
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,599
yes yes that's fantastic

1038
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,720
okay uh i don't see any other questions

1039
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,240
at this time so

1040
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,640
