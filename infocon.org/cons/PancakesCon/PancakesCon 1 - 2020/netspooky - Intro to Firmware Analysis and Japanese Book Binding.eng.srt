1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,679
you should be ready to go hey there

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,839
um you know hear me see me

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
looks fine on my what's good

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,599
oh yeah awesome okay so i'm going to

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,239
start this up

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,320
hi everybody um my name is ned spooky

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,519
uh i am a reverse engineer

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,720
um i work and specialize uh in embedded

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,760
devices

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,000
industrial control systems and some

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,599
esoteric kind of uh

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,079
firmwares here and so i wanted to do a

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:34,640
talk

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,200
uh my first talk will be about firmware

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,920
analysis

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,960
and the introduction to it um so

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,800
it's it's tough because i i talk a lot

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,960
of people about firmware analysis and

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,719
about embedded devices and hardware

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,320
hacking and firmware

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,039
always really seems like very like scary

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,360
because

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,440
it's it's a lot of it's very low level a

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,360
lot of it's you know assembly

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,280
custom architectures there's sorts of

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,480
weird things

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,480
it's a bit of a different ballgame from

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,680
say doing

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,879
analysis of regular software or or doing

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,400
penetration testing or

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,000
different vulnerability analysis for web

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,320
apps um because you know those tools you

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,479
see things that are a lot more apparent

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,360
you know the out the output of an xss

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,200
is a lot more apparent than say

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,479
overflowing a buffer

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,320
on some you know emulated firmware um

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,600
and so i kind of wanted to just go

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,280
through and give a very high level

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,040
overview of firmware analysis and show a

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,320
few examples

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,159
so i made a page here if you go to my

43
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,439
website it's uh

44
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,040
here i'm going to give this to corinth

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,439
so that they can uh

46
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,520
put this in the chat or i'll throw this

47
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,200
in the in the slack chat too i'm not

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,320
sure where the chatting is actually

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,280
happening

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,759
um but here we go so this is my um

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,640
what's it called my website um so this

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,759
this page here is

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,600
is under construction i i've been doing

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,880
a bunch of streaming so i don't have too

55
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,119
much

56
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,040
time to put together a full guide but i

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,399
wanted to give some jump off points and

58
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,399
then be updating this in the future

59
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,119
so that if we have a uh like if i ever

60
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,799
do like a talk about this

61
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,479
um you'll be able to have this as some

62
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,079
sort of a guideline

63
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,959
so with firmware um firmware comes in a

64
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,560
lot of shapes and sizes it comes for a

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,599
lot of devices

66
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,680
a lot of things run firmware everything

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
from your phone to your

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
your fridge your smart bridge your you

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,599
know some some embedded devices that you

70
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,080
might have around the house your router

71
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,800
anything that pretty much has a some

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,680
sort of way

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,239
to be controlled digitally will likely

74
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,000
have some sort of firmware

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,599
um and so whether or not it can be

76
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,120
updated or extracted or

77
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,360
the ease of that is a different story

78
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,640
but we're going to go into

79
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,800
basically for the high level for

80
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,920
somebody who's never done firmware

81
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,280
analysis before

82
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,560
here's some sort of guidelines that i uh

83
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,239
typically you know things that i

84
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,519
typically ask myself and what i'm

85
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,560
looking for

86
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,160
while i do this so establishing goals is

87
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,440
probably one of the most important

88
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,280
things so this whole section up here

89
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,080
um establishing goals is is really

90
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,840
really important for analysis because

91
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,239
doing analysis can be done for a

92
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,000
multitude of different reasons

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,879
and so there are um you might want to

94
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,200
modify the functionality of the firmware

95
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,360
um so like say make it do something

96
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
different maybe add some functionality

97
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,959
or remove some if there's some

98
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,560
spying capability or something that

99
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,319
you're worried about um

100
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,239
if you're looking for vulnerabilities um

101
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,599
is another big thing if you're looking

102
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,800
to exploit the device

103
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,319
um you will definitely want to look at

104
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,680
the firmware and see how it actually

105
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,480
works

106
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,080
you might be looking for sensitive info

107
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,200
so you might be doing like even like a

108
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,959
bug bounty looking for like sensitive

109
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,159
endpoints or

110
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,720
off mechanisms or private keys or

111
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,560
passwords that might be reused across

112
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,159
devices

113
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,560
you might also be looking at protocols

114
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,480
so some embedded devices are going to be

115
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,599
talking some

116
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,319
really obscure internet protocol serial

117
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,360
protocols

118
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,159
or they might be um you know having

119
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,680
their own proprietary protocol and you

120
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,680
want to understand exactly how that

121
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
is processed by the operating system for

122
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,760
the firmware device

123
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,640
and sometimes you just want to

124
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,920
understand how it works i mean that's

125
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,760
that's really how i got into all this i

126
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,879
wanted to see

127
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,040
how does this actually work what do i do

128
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,319
like to uh

129
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,640
to actually peer into it and it's great

130
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,319
for for curiosity

131
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,200
um you know i got started by by doing

132
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,760
this stuff

133
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,360
in my free time for fun now i get to do

134
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,279
it professionally and it's amazing

135
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,238
um and so yeah that's that's basically

136
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:20,639
the

137
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,479
important aspect is just establishing

138
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,759
some goals for yourself

139
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,040
so when you go into this you don't get

140
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,120
overwhelmed by the

141
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,479
possibilities of things you can do

142
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,320
because it's pretty endless

143
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,240
so now there's basic questions that i

144
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,560
like to ask myself and others when i'm

145
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,080
working with them on a project like this

146
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,120
um to analyze some firmware so the

147
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,600
big big one is what is the actual target

148
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,720
device used for

149
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,400
like what is what does it use is it a

150
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
router is it a camera

151
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,360
is it a smart watch is it a you know

152
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,880
industrial control

153
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,320
system or what does it actually do

154
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,479
like who uses it things like that those

155
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,080
are like really important things to ask

156
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,120
for yourself

157
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,039
um what is the underlying processor

158
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,560
architecture is also really really

159
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,400
important to establish early on too

160
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,560
if you are looking at things from any

161
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,800
sort of analysis perspective because

162
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,560
that way you'll be able to know you know

163
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
what kind of tools you might need

164
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,400
um whether or not you can emulate it you

165
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,919
know how easy it will be

166
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,240
to do so um what features are the

167
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,759
support so basically what does it do

168
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,600
like what sort of uh does it have like a

169
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,120
web server on it does it have

170
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,520
you know smb does it have a you know

171
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,720
remote procedure call

172
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,160
there's a ton of different features that

173
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
i might actually have i might have some

174
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,759
things that are only available in

175
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,080
the debug mode it might have stuff that

176
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,120
only is available

177
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,000
you know when it starts up uh what type

178
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,919
of operating system runs in the device

179
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,360
and so that's that's the next big

180
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,199
question here um

181
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,919
not every device has an os so there's a

182
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,520
it's common now for a lot of embedded

183
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,800
devices to have

184
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,400
an operating system like an embedded

185
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,320
linux or windows but sometimes they

186
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,720
might

187
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,960
not support that they might not have the

188
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,240
ability to do that

189
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,520
so they might have a an rtos which is a

190
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,960
real-time operating system

191
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,280
and you can look those up if you are

192
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,400
more interested in them

193
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,240
those are things that are done for

194
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,520
real-time applications

195
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,360
and um certain devices will definitely

196
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,240
use a real-time operating system over

197
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,360
linux because it's faster um and it's

198
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
there's a lot of advantages to it but

199
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,400
there's also some disadvantages where

200
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,520
it's not as easy to

201
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
work with all the time and sometimes

202
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,680
there's just bare bones application code

203
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,039
so if you're looking at firmware for

204
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,039
something that's really really simple

205
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,400
it might be just raw application code it

206
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,199
could be

207
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,960
it could even be something like um you

208
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,440
know like like java byte code on like a

209
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,319
vm

210
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,639
or or it could be you know like dot net

211
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,080
core embedded or something like that

212
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,520
there's so many different kinds that it

213
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,400
could do

214
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,880
um but some of those will run and be a

215
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,520
bare

216
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,199
binary that runs on the system and

217
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,199
that's all that all that runs

218
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,120
um so it's really important to establish

219
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
what the actual

220
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,599
operating system or what the actual code

221
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,880
that runs on the system

222
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,599
like how it actually processes data so

223
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,599
it's very important to establish

224
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,360
other chips on board is really important

225
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,400
if you're looking at it from a hardware

226
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,280
perspective

227
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,240
it also gives you a view onto what the

228
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,000
actual um

229
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,199
the actual uh the called

230
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,880
functionality could be there's a wi-fi

231
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,000
chip um that's really important to uh

232
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,319
to you know the functionality you might

233
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,680
be like okay so that's wi-fi

234
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,039
i know that has an esp it is 8266 on

235
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,080
board or something

236
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,479
or a bluetooth module um and then what

237
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,080
types of programs run on it so

238
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,360
that's definitely really important to

239
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,680
understand too how our program is loaded

240
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,800
how has the functionality changed um

241
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,120
so the next step to talk about is uh

242
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,960
getting a hold of firmware so firmware

243
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,560
can be very difficult to track down

244
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,440
sometimes

245
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,639
sometimes you can get them on a vendor

246
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,800
website other times you have to use a

247
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,280
bit of osun so use google dorking

248
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,680
searching a whole website for a file

249
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,720
type

250
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,680
maybe bin or zip using google dorking

251
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,039
definitely huge

252
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,120
sometimes they might even have it on

253
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,080
some like weird

254
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,720
json endpoint that like has links to

255
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,160
firmware that you can only get if you've

256
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,520
been given like an auth token from the

257
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,080
device

258
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,360
from the server um so the other

259
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,919
another big one the harder ones are are

260
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:12,639
analyzing

261
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,639
firmware updater apps so you might have

262
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,639
an android app that updates something

263
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,560
you might have a desktop like windows

264
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,319
app that loads firmware might have the

265
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,080
firmware packed into it

266
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,280
there's all sorts of things like that

267
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,520
you might have to look into that

268
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,560
another big thing is is p caps so i've

269
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,039
pulled

270
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,080
uh like stuff directly out of p caps

271
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,360
before firmware

272
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
um it's definitely challenging um

273
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,679
sometimes to make sure that everything

274
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,440
is where it should be but that is not

275
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,958
out of the question if you have a

276
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,519
updater app and it's it's encrypted at

277
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,080
rest

278
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,480
but it's decrypted while it it goes over

279
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,360
the network

280
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,560
um using a pcap or using a wireshark or

281
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,519
pcp dump you can grab sometimes um

282
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,440
firmware straight from a pcap

283
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,880
um and sometimes you have to directly

284
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,640
interface with the hardware which

285
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,720
i'm not going to get into here but

286
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,399
there's an awesome talk buses can fly

287
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,839
shout out i know he's watching

288
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,600
um he did an excellent talk on hardware

289
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,040
hacking for the masses it's a really

290
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,160
cool talk about

291
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,760
a lot of this kind of stuff too and how

292
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,360
to extract firmware from a hardware

293
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,399
device

294
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,399
um so the next big thing to look at is

295
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,080
firmware files so how is firmware

296
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,959
updated

297
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,959
um so there might be the firmware

298
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,720
updater apps we talked about before

299
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,480
there might be a zip file we have to

300
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,240
upload there might be some

301
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,560
you know other mechanism however it is

302
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,240
you want to know how it's updated how it

303
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,760
gets onto the device

304
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,240
um what is the actual file format of the

305
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,120
firmware

306
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,360
if you have a second later on i will be

307
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,800
able to show you some custom file

308
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,959
formats that firmwares are in

309
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,680
um is the file uh encrypted so the

310
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
firmware might be encrypted

311
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,160
and decrypted by a decrypter stub or a

312
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,839
program that's on the

313
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,320
device that actually takes the firmware

314
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,519
validates it and then

315
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,640
applies the firmware changes um and then

316
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,480
is the firmware that you've downloaded a

317
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,160
full image or is it just some sort of

318
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,120
patch

319
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,959
um so one second um

320
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,880
so that's really important to know too

321
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,079
is whether or not

322
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,560
the firmware is uh it might be a full

323
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,519
firmware image

324
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,519
that is a full operating system of full

325
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,040
rtos whatever you want

326
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
um from the you know it's directly

327
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,399
loaded onto disk

328
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,560
sometimes they might only patch just a

329
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,640
small portion of it and still have

330
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
you know other firmware other things

331
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,160
that actually um

332
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
actually run the code that you sent it

333
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,600
so imagine like basically sending it a

334
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
new binary to run a new exe or something

335
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,279
um so the last things too um are

336
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,000
interaction

337
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,160
so as a user uh how would you interact

338
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,000
with the device uh do you have a web app

339
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,959
do you have

340
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,279
android app do you have a front panel or

341
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,720
a mixture of all those

342
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
um how would you interact with the

343
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,320
device as a developer so it's like

344
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,519
debug ports things like that um

345
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,360
wanted to program the device or reflash

346
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,839
it inputs and outputs the device might

347
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:54,880
have

348
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,480
in general similar to the other

349
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
interactions and how does the device

350
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,200
interact with

351
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
other hardware devices that are on the

352
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,519
system or non-volatile memory

353
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,680
um so these are all really important

354
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,959
things to question two

355
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,399
and the last things here are if you're

356
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,160
looking for vulnerabilities are there

357
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,640
any

358
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,720
known phones for this device or any of

359
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,240
the technologies on board

360
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,839
um and are there any write-ups or blog

361
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,440
posts about this device you can

362
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,279
definitely get caught up into a

363
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,200
uh like a wormhole of looking up stuff

364
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,880
uh without having looked at prior

365
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,959
research and it's definitely important

366
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,560
to uh look that up

367
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,040
um so all right we have 10 minutes left

368
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,600
for this

369
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,040
uh this section here so i'm just going

370
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,440
to go briefly over some techniques

371
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,880
um on this page too i have further

372
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,480
resources which are awesome

373
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
um just some videos that i have here i'm

374
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,600
going to add some more

375
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,120
as time goes on but these are all some

376
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,720
really cool um

377
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,560
mixture of beginner and advanced things

378
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,839
you can do

379
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,839
so for me personally everybody has their

380
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,600
tools everybody has things they like

381
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,399
i am a huge stand for uh for radari 2

382
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,240
and the whole overary suite so i'm going

383
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,880
to demonstrate

384
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,639
i'm using some of those tools a little

385
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,800
bit um file carving is

386
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,240
really really important too if you're

387
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
looking at firmware to extract files

388
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,920
so bin walk and all the file system

389
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,320
unpackers are really really important

390
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,079
if you want to get into it emulation is

391
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,240
really cool too um you can use qmu you

392
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,079
can use docker with qmu

393
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,880
and run you know say a router in docker

394
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,200
it's

395
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,120
virtualized um it seems like it's

396
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,639
running in native hardware

397
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,800
um arm x is another really cool uh

398
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,000
router

399
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,480
virtualization framework and firmware

400
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,000
dyna is used for

401
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,959
linux linux based devices and emulating

402
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,079
those

403
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,399
um so binary diffing is also really

404
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,279
interesting if you're looking for

405
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,000
vulnerabilities

406
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,720
too and see what changed um and then in

407
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,079
this talk we're going to use this

408
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,519
firmware so if you do want to

409
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,200
play along at home um we're using this

410
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,240
wnap uh 320 firmware

411
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,880
um that's some of the things i wanted to

412
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,000
discuss to okay

413
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,560
i'm just going to jump right into this

414
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,120
um

415
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,600
already so here is my uh i had to put

416
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,639
all this on here because i had to switch

417
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,160
over to another computer real quickly so

418
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,720
this is on

419
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,519
a uh my vps so hopefully everything

420
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,519
works the way that i think it's going to

421
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,680
but we're going to start off with uh

422
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,519
this here this wnap

423
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,440
so i'm just going to go over some real

424
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,639
quick things so this

425
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,079
this is this came directly from the

426
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,320
vendor so this is firmware version

427
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,519
you know 2.0.3 this is for a router

428
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,600
so what we'll do is just extract this

429
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,880
and see what it looks like

430
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,320
so this is like what you would you would

431
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,920
send this to a

432
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,200
a router to update it um and so in here

433
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,480
it gave us a tar file

434
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,399
and then it gave us release notes which

435
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,839
if you read the release notes it just

436
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,120
explains what was changed

437
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,160
how to load the firmware um

438
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,720
so right now i'm going to make make a

439
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,079
file system directory because what we're

440
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,920
going to do here

441
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,600
is we're going to tar this file right

442
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,040
and it gives us um you know a squash fs

443
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,480
which is a um a file system that the

444
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,040
whole

445
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,600
uh firmware is running on um it gives us

446
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,199
this vm linux which is like the

447
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,360
the kernel and then we also have uh

448
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
what's called some of the hashes to make

449
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,800
sure that those are okay

450
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,880
so we're going to use unswashfest real

451
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,320
quick um

452
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,920
hold on to uh

453
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,199
yeah i'm not going to be able to make

454
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,279
any devices so we just

455
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,440
real quick we just we just unpacked the

456
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,199
file system on here

457
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,000
um you know it's a linux file system so

458
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,199
this one this one's a

459
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,560
much easier thing to analyze so if

460
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,920
you're playing along later um it's

461
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,360
definitely really cool to

462
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,320
play around something that's a bit

463
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,720
easier to look at so we can like go to

464
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,040
like

465
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,079
etsy and we can see like you know in it

466
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,199
tab

467
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,720
which has like uh some of the

468
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,320
initialization functionalities which

469
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,279
shows us like

470
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,880
some of the things that it does it's

471
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,639
mounting you know disks opening up

472
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,000
serial port

473
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,959
things like that um you know you can ls

474
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:49,360
or

475
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,880
ll init d and you can see all these

476
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,120
scripts that are used to start up

477
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,320
the software on the system um

478
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,600
there's also something that you'll

479
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,519
notice a lot too if you go to like say

480
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,560
bin um pretty much everything in here is

481
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,800
similar to busybox because a lot of

482
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,399
embedded devices especially or a lot of

483
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,839
embedded linux devices

484
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,120
are using busybox as their primary um

485
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,440
like interface for the shell so if you

486
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,040
run something on a shell

487
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,920
with it'll it'll go to busy boxes like

488
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,240
an argument to it and then it'll run

489
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,480
that as like a an all-in-one sort of

490
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,040
utility um it's very useful

491
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,199
but you'll see that a lot here i'm sorry

492
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,639
to interrupt but is it possible to get

493
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,839
the font a little bit larger for

494
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,720
everybody

495
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,759
sure all right is that good

496
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,759
should be good that's probably great

497
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,360
thank you okay cool

498
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
all right so also the other thing too so

499
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,720
when you're on here we have

500
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,199
full one oh lord hold on

501
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,120
uh all right so we're if you're in etsy

502
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,600
too um we can look at stuff like uh

503
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,720
shadow and like uh like

504
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,480
cat password like these are like device

505
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,800
like system users that are on here

506
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,199
um so it's like when you're when you're

507
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,720
looking at firmware you can sometimes

508
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,160
see things you would normally be able to

509
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,759
see interacting with the device

510
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,440
so here we know there's admin users

511
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,880
default non-root

512
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,959
there is a root user doesn't seem to be

513
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,959
any passwords that on stuff

514
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,600
um all interesting things um you can go

515
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,079
to like the home directory

516
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,160
oops hold on i'm like having an issue

517
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,000
here once again

518
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,260
um

519
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,319
[Music]

520
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,639
so i made the font size bigger it's kind

521
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
of messing up things um

522
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,320
so we'll go to yeah so home we know that

523
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,199
there's like a

524
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,440
web server on here um so this is like

525
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,959
where it's served out of

526
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,399
i'm so basically poking around and

527
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,759
exploring stuff is like really really

528
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,720
awesome

529
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,480
um if we go back here

530
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,079
we can do things like um search for

531
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,279
begin rsa so we'd be like a grep

532
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,000
and find oh there's a uh a private key

533
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,399
here

534
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,959
there's a private key in dropbear um so

535
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,720
we can like cap those things and we can

536
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,520
find some secret

537
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,119
secret stuffs or some private keys here

538
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,720
i don't know what they're used for um

539
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,760
we'd be able to look

540
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,599
you know if we did more in-depth

541
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,520
analysis um you can do

542
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,799
really advanced things like uh finding

543
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,799
all the ips that are in here

544
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,880
so i have a long grip that i didn't put

545
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,839
in my

546
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,000
um my thing here hold on a second

547
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,799
we have this uh long grip i was able to

548
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,840
find uh

549
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,760
all the ips in here so sometimes this is

550
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,280
useful if it's

551
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,000
um going out somewhere else um it's not

552
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
in binary mode so

553
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,360
but we do know that like busybox ghcp

554
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,559
has all these things

555
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,400
um always really useful to enumerate

556
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,160
this kind of stuff from a

557
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,280
uh firmware um if you go to uh

558
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,440
like in here and use a local bin we see

559
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,880
there's a bunch of other things in here

560
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,000
too for scripts

561
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,559
so yeah basically the the point of this

562
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,240
is to just show that we're in here

563
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,000
we've unpacked the firmware and we're

564
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,280
now looking at it

565
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,880
um if we wanted to um you know

566
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,480
upload this back to uh if we wanted to

567
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,240
change the way i put it back it would be

568
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,919
pretty simple because this here just has

569
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,200
some md5s

570
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,559
so we definitely just change what the

571
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,400
md5 is of the car

572
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,160
file and then you just be able to upload

573
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,000
it back to the router

574
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,919
um i'm gonna have a couple more minutes

575
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,760
on this i'm just gonna go real quick and

576
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,960
show you some

577
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,200
other firmware so here i'll go to

578
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,000
mystery router

579
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,679
so i can't really talk about some of

580
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,280
these routers because i've done some

581
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,799
um some plug boundaries with them

582
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,919
um here's here's one i'm calling

583
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:38,480
mysteryfirmware.bin

584
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,880
um and so this one here you run bin walk

585
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,720
right

586
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,000
um we're able to see if there's a uh

587
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,320
squash fest file system on here we don't

588
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,600
know what this bin is it could be

589
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,480
anything

590
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
um so we run this and we carve out this

591
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,799
uh some compressed data here

592
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,400
squash fest um so we can go to that

593
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,080
mystery firmware and then you know oops

594
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,360
get it

595
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,880
once i might have messed this up

596
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,559
yeah well regardless i i take the wrong

597
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,200
command i don't

598
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,000
think i have squash effects on this um

599
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,360
for whatever reason

600
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,919
but the um i'm able to extract it the

601
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:26,960
same way that i did

602
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,120
um for the the other firmware here

603
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,280
um but so the important reason i wanted

604
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,039
to even show you this was because

605
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,240
in here we see that there is a custom

606
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,080
file header so we did that bin walk

607
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,200
right um and

608
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,080
we see that at offset 56 there is some

609
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,280
compressed data

610
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,919
and an offset uh 3a there is a firmware

611
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:50,640
header

612
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,919
right so 3a from our header so we look

613
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,720
at 3a

614
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,200
and that's right here this is the start

615
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,640
of a firmware header

616
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,120
and it ends at 56 which is like right

617
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,000
here

618
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,240
um and so the firmware header itself is

619
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,400
is this big and so you know there might

620
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,240
be data here you look up in on

621
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
online what kind of firmware header that

622
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,080
is it's like metadata about it it might

623
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,679
be like the size of the firmware the

624
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,200
size of the sections

625
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
uh hashes also the things that are

626
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,120
usually included in a firmware header

627
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,960
so very important to know um that you

628
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,080
might see something like that you might

629
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,320
have to modify it if you are changing it

630
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,440
um so the last one i'll show you

631
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,200
is from a mystery vape

632
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,159
um so this one here if we run bin walk

633
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,120
on it right

634
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,320
there is nothing that comes out of it

635
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,080
and so when you see something like this

636
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
and it's just blank there's nothing in

637
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,720
here

638
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,799
um usually you're gonna have to do some

639
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,320
some digging by hand

640
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,360
um so when i

641
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,679
am looking at something like this

642
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,880
something like a vape

643
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,320
it's gonna be very very um like

644
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,159
it's gonna be a it's called like more of

645
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,520
a bare bones kind of thing like you

646
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,000
wouldn't

647
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,320
want a vape to run linux i don't think

648
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
but on here you'll see something

649
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,600
pretty common for a lot of these sort of

650
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,120
things um so

651
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,039
you'll see what looks to be like a bunch

652
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,240
of zeros

653
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,640
like offset like this and usually what

654
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,240
this would mean for something like

655
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,799
say arm um would be this would be like

656
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,320
the first address that would be jumped

657
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,039
to

658
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,559
um by the the actual chip so it would

659
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,240
say okay i'm gonna start at like five

660
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,480
seven four eight zero four eight three

661
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,520
somewhere down here

662
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,120
it could be a virtual address and it'd

663
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,280
be loaded somewhere high up into memory

664
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,640
but the rest of these are usually going

665
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,320
to be addresses that

666
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,000
are returned to which are really really

667
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,840
important if you're reverse engineering

668
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,840
to understand where the interrupts are

669
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,600
how like the processor handles certain

670
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,400
things

671
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,120
so it's um that's a you know important

672
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,080
tip to know

673
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,960
yeah when you look at something like

674
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,120
this you might see it laid out like this

675
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,159
and you definitely know that it's

676
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,840
probably like a raw binary firmware

677
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,559
image

678
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,840
um there doesn't appear to be any

679
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,679
strings in here um

680
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,280
if i did like rob into um

681
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,600
you know mystery.bin let's see if it's a

682
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,559
bunch of strings

683
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,360
i'm really a fan of robin two uh for

684
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,480
string searching

685
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,960
so dash

686
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,799
let's say i went to analysis

687
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
um

688
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,080
so let's say we just did like robin two

689
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
dashes easy i have renamed

690
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,480
whatever you see a bunch of stuff in

691
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,840
here like um

692
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,799
you know error strings things like that

693
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,240
um but it also gives you the offset

694
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,440
which i really love

695
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,200
um so very useful you can also use robin

696
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,600
to

697
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,360
dash i to um you know look at

698
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,840
things and give you the firmware

699
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,400
architecture

700
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,600
um so like right here we see mips

701
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,240
um is the actual um processor

702
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,200
architecture for

703
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,640
that other router that we first looked

704
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,320
at it's an elf

705
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,919
uses this linker so yeah that's pretty

706
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:08,240
much

707
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,840
it i guess i'm kind of done now with

708
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
this side of the talk um

709
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,400
thanks karen for reminding me here um

710
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,280
but yeah so this

711
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,880
i'm definitely gonna upload a bunch of

712
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,120
stuff to this uh page here

713
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,000
um you know soon so just keep an eye out

714
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,480
on it

715
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,640
and also obviously follow me and and

716
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,240
here dm me if you

717
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,840
have any questions about this part of

718
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,440
the talk

719
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,520
so now i'm going to share

720
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,039
and do some uh book binding

721
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,080
so here we go

722
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,400
all right so this is a bit more relaxing

723
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,039
um and not as crazy overall

724
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,600
um so yeah japanese book binding um i'm

725
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,880
just gonna

726
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,000
switch over here real quick so japanese

727
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,440
book bunny is something that i've been

728
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,679
i've done on and off for a while um

729
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,760
versus different style of book binding

730
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,320
um because i'm really a fan of making uh

731
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,000
i'm just really love stationary

732
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,919
in general um so i love um

733
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,520
you know a nice journal a nice um

734
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,600
you know book of some sort um to write

735
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,720
in to draw and

736
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,400
and sometimes you have books that are

737
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,480
kind of like messed up like this uh this

738
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,400
windows 98 manual here

739
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,760
um is uh it was in very rough shape

740
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
and the the pages were ripped out and

741
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,200
everything so i i

742
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,400
de-fined it and uh you know bound it

743
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
you know in the style of uh japanese

744
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,559
clip findings very forced irish dab

745
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,679
binding but yeah it

746
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,120
you know reads the same as a regular

747
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,400
book um but it's just nice to have

748
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:47,840
so once again like grab my stuff

749
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,360
so if you're going to be doing binding

750
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,559
like this

751
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,840
um you notice here that there are

752
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,840
four holes right so stab binding is

753
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,480
is like characterized by having you know

754
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:04,960
even

755
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,919
holes like this and string that holds it

756
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:08,720
all together

757
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
um you know it's all tidy there's no

758
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,760
glue used there's uh

759
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,240
nothing too fancy um this is a very very

760
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,679
bare bones way to

761
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,440
to make you know yeah a book

762
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,400
um it's it's easy to add new things to

763
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,120
the book you want

764
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
you can untie it because it's not you

765
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
know it's just regular binding it

766
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,559
to like a binder it's a bit more

767
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,720
long-term than that um but what's cool

768
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,159
about is you can do things like have

769
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,640
mixed pages so if you wanted to have say

770
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,159
you know a bunch of windows need for

771
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,679
windows any uh

772
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,200
you know materials and then have a bunch

773
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,880
of notes you could find

774
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,600
some note paper in there um you know

775
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,400
every page

776
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,919
could be different you could make a zine

777
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,000
out of it or a scrapbook which uh

778
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,679
i forget who had done the scrapbook talk

779
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,600
that was awesome i watched it earlier

780
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,480
um it's also a really quick way to

781
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,919
repair something if you want to keep

782
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,200
things bound together

783
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,000
but you the the books are destroyed or

784
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,919
they're they're messed up in some way

785
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,880
um the you know it is you know easy to

786
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,640
learn but it's difficult to master and

787
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,600
make it

788
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,360
right but you can make really nice

789
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,440
looking books um right off the gate

790
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,520
if you uh go through it it can be a bit

791
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,039
time consuming um

792
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,640
more so than just stapling things

793
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,320
together but it looks nice

794
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,320
and it's much easier to uh to fix up

795
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,679
so i'm just going to start off real

796
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,120
quick so i'll have a sheet of paper here

797
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,320
i'll just show

798
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,559
how i uh i'll go through this process

799
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,679
here

800
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,799
so let's get this out of the way

801
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,640
so i have this little cutter here you

802
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,480
can use anything you want to

803
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,080
but we know that a normal sheet of

804
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,679
american printer paper is going to be

805
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,120
eight and a half by eleven

806
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,799
so if we're gonna be cutting up some

807
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,520
paper let's say we're gonna make a small

808
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,080
small little booklet like one of these a

809
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,919
very small little journal here

810
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,039
um you want to make it so that it's oops

811
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,919
it's not opening um you know you can cut

812
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:56,559
this into like

813
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,600
fourths so that would be like five

814
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,799
you know 11 divided by two is four or

815
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,240
five and a half and then um eight and a

816
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,200
half divided by two is

817
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,960
4.25 so we can

818
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,480
line up all these in this little cutter

819
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,720
here

820
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,880
now we have four pages

821
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,559
here so now i have

822
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,799
this really cool tool that broke last

823
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,880
night when i was trying to uh

824
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,720
to prepare some some things for this

825
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,080
talk

826
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,200
normally it normally looks kind of like

827
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,159
this

828
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,279
um and you can you can

829
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,240
hole punch with it but it exploded into

830
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,279
a million pieces

831
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,039
and i could not get it to work so i'm

832
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,799
going to be trying

833
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,080
to do a little bit with this just to

834
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,679
show you but i do have some stuff

835
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,520
already prepared

836
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,559
um so it's really important when you

837
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,720
have a new piece of paper to establish

838
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,240
one paper as like your guide paper so

839
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,600
if you start off here we know that this

840
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,840
is for um

841
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,039
four inches and or 4.25 inches

842
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,320
you can round it up a little bit to

843
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,960
maybe you know five or whatever you want

844
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,679
to but

845
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,279
what you want to do is cut holes into it

846
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,480
so that it looks like this so i have

847
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,720
this front paper here and

848
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,720
i have four holes that are cut into it

849
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,080
that are evenly spaced you this one here

850
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,799
is a bit

851
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,960
longer if you get over three inches from

852
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,279
the top you might want to have a holes

853
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,799
on the top and the bottom that are a

854
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,399
little bit closer to there and space it

855
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,279
out normally

856
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,279
just because this has to kind of hold

857
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,480
into place

858
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,640
um and it could be harder if you have a

859
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,840
really long um

860
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,880
piece of uh paper and you're trying to

861
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,000
hold together with uh

862
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,320
just this little loop of string um so

863
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,440
oops so i had cut up this one here and i

864
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,679
i just punched holes into it

865
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,840
so when i'm going through and i'm trying

866
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
to add new pages

867
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,360
you can just take some of these

868
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,919
binder clip and then once you have them

869
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,399
all lined up good that you want to

870
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,000
you can just sort of do that and uh

871
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,480
have them held together now for the

872
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,159
punching aspect of it i have this little

873
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,360
hole puncher which

874
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,080
um you see here it's like a piece of um

875
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
there's like a little ring here like a

876
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,200
sharp ring

877
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,720
you can use like pretty much anything

878
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,200
you want to as long as you can fit

879
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,320
a um you know three about

880
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,960
three widths of twine through so let's

881
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,200
say we're using this twine here

882
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,799
um i'm going to be able to fit like at

883
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,240
least three of them through

884
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,399
or double it up like this but yeah

885
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,240
that'll be about the guide

886
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,520
the size of the hole that you want

887
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,640
because you're going to be wrapping

888
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,159
things around through them

889
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,360
and so um you can use like uh

890
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,200
people use book binding alls which are

891
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,480
like basically like

892
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,360
picks um you don't have to use that um

893
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,760
if you have like uh even an exacto knife

894
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,120
you can do the same thing as long as you

895
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,600
make

896
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,120
you know evenly sized holes and they're

897
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,640
consistent throughout

898
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
so what i normally do for this sort of

899
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,240
thing is i'll just like you know once i

900
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,000
have my guide holes punched

901
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,880
i'll just use a puncher like this which

902
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,480
normally i use that thing and it's a lot

903
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,080
easier

904
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,760
but this is just sort of my my guide um

905
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,440
but now once that i've i've had them all

906
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,600
lined up i can just punch right through

907
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,919
all the way to the end this is not

908
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,200
happening with these

909
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,559
i'm gonna have to find any way to do

910
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,640
this um

911
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,440
hopefully i can make one sheet at least

912
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,559
um

913
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,720
so taking this out let me see that

914
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,760
well since i kind of messed up here i

915
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,120
got one sheet out of it

916
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,520
so i basically made a whole new sheet

917
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,039
you know out of this you can use a

918
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,440
book um there's like they have those

919
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,960
like whole bunchers for binders too if

920
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,640
you used to use them like school

921
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,080
um some people have those lying around

922
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,440
the house i used to have one i don't

923
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,559
know where it went

924
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,640
but you can make something like this um

925
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,320
just punch through

926
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,399
i'll get these out of the way um just a

927
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,360
good cooking show

928
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,200
i have some prepared pieces here

929
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,279
um so i had cut up a bunch of types of

930
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,960
pieces of paper so i have these

931
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
i have some graph paper i'm a huge fan

932
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,760
of a nice graph paper

933
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,279
um so i have all these things lined up

934
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,720
here

935
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,799
and i'm gonna

936
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,720
go through and do the binding process

937
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,519
now so when you do the actual binding

938
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,120
you're going to want the string to be

939
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,960
about three times

940
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,240
the size of the width

941
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,480
or the length of the book um just to

942
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,799
give you a bit of a slack because you

943
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,320
can't really put string back once you've

944
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,120
thrown it down um so that seems just

945
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,519
about right

946
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,040
so i'm gonna put this here

947
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,559
[Music]

948
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,440
and to actually do the binding part i

949
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,039
use a needle

950
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,880
um but depending on the type of twine

951
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,039
that you have you might actually want

952
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,519
something a bit bigger um

953
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,519
another option too instead of threading

954
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,200
through needles you can tape it to a

955
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,000
needle

956
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,360
although you have to make sure the tape

957
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,399
is not so um

958
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,440
it's called not so thick on the page

959
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,039
or not so thick on the needle itself to

960
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,640
fit through the holes

961
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,840
um so there's a ton of guides for this

962
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,320
online

963
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,360
you can definitely look them up for

964
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,919
stab binding um but i'll show you a very

965
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,440
basic technique for it

966
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,679
so i usually start off around

967
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,159
turn around on the back side here on the

968
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,440
second hole

969
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,480
you wrap it around

970
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,799
and so the first one is really important

971
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,480
to make sure that you

972
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,159
have the a good amount of length of

973
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,320
string down the end

974
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,519
um so you can tie it after so that

975
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,120
should be a good amount there

976
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,080
for this size paper um so i have these

977
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,960
two

978
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,919
in this first binding hold my fingers

979
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,120
here

980
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,479
then i'm gonna go through the first hole

981
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,039
i'm gonna wrap it around

982
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,519
all there so now at this point you can

983
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,120
tighten and make a bit more

984
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,080
adjustments to it

985
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,600
all right so now we have the first real

986
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,000
knot or the first real like bound

987
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,519
piece in here um and we're going to wrap

988
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,799
this around the front

989
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,840
or the top of the book

990
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,840
and push it right back to hole number

991
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,080
one

992
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,678
i hope you guys can see this okay too

993
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,320
all right so now we are currently on the

994
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,240
back side

995
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,120
to pull this through

996
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,200
so now we're going to complete this loop

997
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,559
on the back and we're going to go

998
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,360
through

999
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,078
number two again

1000
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,399
and then go through number three

1001
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,520
and wrap this around two and it's good

1002
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,199
to make adjustments along the way too as

1003
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,320
you're as you're

1004
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,399
threading these together um because you

1005
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,679
have that first one that started off

1006
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,639
here

1007
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,079
just make sure you pull all the little

1008
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,560
pieces you know

1009
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,239
just to have them tight and snug you

1010
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,918
want to make them you know insanely snug

1011
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:34,639
but

1012
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,839
snug enough where they're not going to

1013
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,560
uh to be feel loose as you hold them

1014
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,800
so

1015
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,159
actually one second i actually missed

1016
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,879
the bus stop here

1017
00:34:53,679 --> 00:35:02,640
hold on live demos huh

1018
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,040
be careful not to stab yourself if you

1019
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
have a thimble which i should have had

1020
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,240
um it's definitely more useful

1021
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,240
um so we're actually supposed to go

1022
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,000
through

1023
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,920
number four here it's before number

1024
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,160
three

1025
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,560
um but we do the same techniques of

1026
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,640
wrapping it around

1027
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,160
oops wrapping it around the spine

1028
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,320
and so now we're gonna do the same thing

1029
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,680
we did at the top and wrap around the

1030
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,560
bottom

1031
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,359
of the fourth hole

1032
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,119
it looks like i actually cut a little

1033
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,960
bit too less of string which you can

1034
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,599
also fix

1035
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,839
too

1036
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,839
but so now we're at number three

1037
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,240
pull this through

1038
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,480
and so yeah i did cut a little bit too

1039
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,400
too little of string this is definitely

1040
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,760
something that happens

1041
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,480
do at least three times the amount um

1042
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
even if you think it's too much

1043
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,839
um but so a thing that i i like to do

1044
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,599
which i'll just for the sake of time

1045
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,800
um you know not do it

1046
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,480
but i like to pull the strings through

1047
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,839
here through the middle of the page

1048
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,359
and um you basically pull the string

1049
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,560
through the second hole

1050
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,240
so that it looks seamless through the

1051
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,680
inside of this part so you would put

1052
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,480
this

1053
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,720
first string in those middle pages and

1054
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,800
then you thread this to the same page

1055
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,200
pull it down and wrap it around the

1056
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,680
bottom and then knot it up like that

1057
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,000
um but for here we can just tie it like

1058
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,119
this

1059
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,240
not to be too crazy and just tied up in

1060
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,160
a knot

1061
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,320
and then well very very sloppy right

1062
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,200
there but that would be

1063
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,599
your typical book um i didn't wrap it

1064
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,240
around number three as well either

1065
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,040
here um because i'm running out of

1066
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,320
strength but

1067
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,440
that is i guess how you turn it into

1068
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,880
something like this

1069
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,800
um so yeah cool um

1070
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,920
15 minutes total okay so all right that

1071
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,119
should be

1072
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,400
if the time yeah i wasn't sure how much

1073
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,160
time actually left okay you have another

1074
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,520
10 minutes if you want to do q

1075
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,119
a or something like that i know that a

1076
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,720
lot of people are asking what the whole

1077
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,560
punch tool that you were using was

1078
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,400
okay um let me take a look at this stuff

1079
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,000
here

1080
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,359
oh my goodness all righty

1081
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,440
um so this hole puncher here that i'm

1082
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,640
using this is a

1083
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,960
thing i got at michael's right so this

1084
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,079
this normally

1085
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,079
has this little thing in here it has a

1086
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,520
spring

1087
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,800
um that this is wrapped around or you

1088
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,520
put this in here

1089
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,400
um but it something broke and i don't

1090
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,040
know

1091
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,640
like a little piece flew somewhere or

1092
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,920
something um but i thrown this in there

1093
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,240
and

1094
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,920
i had like you know taking like a

1095
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,560
screwdriver

1096
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,200
into place

1097
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,240
this is how you troubleshoot live demos

1098
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,440
when it's uh

1099
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,480
crafts instead of computers yes but so

1100
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,920
what it's supposed to do is like

1101
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,960
go down you know hold it so it doesn't

1102
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,040
like destroy it but it makes a hole

1103
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
that's like a really nice hole it's you

1104
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,119
know much easier to use

1105
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,280
but it keeps it kept exploding on me and

1106
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,640
so i'm definitely gonna have to fix it i

1107
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,680
think there's a

1108
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,119
it looks like there's a crack that

1109
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,240
happened which i don't know if you can

1110
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,079
see in the uh

1111
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,440
the light but there's a crack that um

1112
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,040
mess up the pressure that holds this

1113
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,640
thing in place so

1114
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,880
um but yeah i mean that's a really cool

1115
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,400
thing that i have i bought when i was

1116
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,680
doing this a lot more

1117
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,200
um but you can use any kind of hole

1118
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,119
punch you can use the you know needle

1119
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:39,920
you can use an

1120
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
exacto knife if you want to just cut out

1121
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,760
like you know holes in

1122
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,880
you know specific ways but as long as

1123
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,720
you can make a first good base

1124
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,320
hole um for something um you can

1125
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,800
do whatever you want with it cut around

1126
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,280
in stone

1127
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,440
um

1128
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,800
so yeah you can use the tapestry needle

1129
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,760
for knitting too um

1130
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,200
you know anything you have that's really

1131
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,920
uh it's really sharp and able to pierce

1132
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,320
through

1133
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,400
pages and this printer paper this is

1134
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,320
like 28 weight printer paper it's very

1135
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,119
thick

1136
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,040
um if you're this is actually a lot

1137
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,400
thinner if you have

1138
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,720
very thin paper and you want to bind

1139
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,680
that's um

1140
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,280
you know an advantage to using that um

1141
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,359
anybody have any uh questions any more

1142
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,720
questions

1143
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,640
we did have somebody who popped up in

1144
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,240
the q a that said the tool is called a

1145
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,079
japanese screw punch and included an

1146
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,680
amazon link so thank you for that

1147
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,200
oh sweet that's awesome um

1148
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,599
somebody wanted your csh theme is that

1149
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,200
available in your notes

1150
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,520
wait say that again somebody wanted your

1151
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,520
zsh theme from earlier

1152
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,520
oh yeah i can throw that in there this

1153
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,040
is this is just

1154
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,640
a bash um like for my bash rc so

1155
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,320
i'll just throw this in here it's just a

1156
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,400
ps1 line

1157
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,320
um but yeah i definitely want to get

1158
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,560
more into this aspect of it um

1159
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,440
