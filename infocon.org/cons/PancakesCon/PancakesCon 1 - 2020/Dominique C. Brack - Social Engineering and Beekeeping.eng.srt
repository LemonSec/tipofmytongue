00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,120
welcome to the contribution

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,000
from myself and my daughter here you

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
will see the agenda for today

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,080
it's the introduction to social

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,200
engineering and

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,039
peace respectively beekeeping

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,359
we will cover different topics today for

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,480
you

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,680
and we will show you the bee house

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,439
for instance we will talk about

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,840
fake honey

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,360
i will give you some links for fantastic

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,680
recipes

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,680
you can make with honey we talk about

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,360
intensity levels

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,840
which is a really important topic

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:58,879
we will also cover engagement management

18
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,160
abed attack vector development

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,519
approach selection method hi

20
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,240

26
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,920
one of my hobbies

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,960

[Music]

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
yeah just just set a fire alarm no no

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,720
no no it's okay what

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:05,840

49
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,099
[Music]

50
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,599
so hi

51
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
welcome to my bees so the first thing

52
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,959
you do is

53
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,760
you go to your bees you approach them

54
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,200
but then you stop

55
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,400
to stop in front of the bees and first

56
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,519
determine

57
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,400
if they are friendly today or if they

58
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,840
are not

59
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,599
make sure you check this out first

60
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,440
so it appears to be they're quite

61
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,400
friendly

62
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,080
no attack so far let's see if we can

63
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,440
catch one which has the

64
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,199
pollen on its legs there is one

65
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,680
you saw that one very quickly went

66
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,919
inside the height

67
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,240
there's another one fully loaded with

68
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,280
pollen now i can introduce you

69
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,639
to some of the basic tools

70
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,759
this is a smoker no it's not what you

71
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,880
think

72
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,080
it's for give a little puff to the bees

73
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,840
they stay a bit more calm that's for

74
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,880
grabbing the hives take them out and

75
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,919
have a look

76
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,639
and this is also a tool we use for

77
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,080
beekeeping

78
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,840
but you will see later

79
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,840
[Music]

80
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,690
okay

81
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,819
[Applause]

82
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,420
[Music]

83
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,420
[Applause]

84
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,489
[Music]

85
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,840
um

86
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
oh

87
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,240
so this is now honey fresh

88
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,720
from the bees as fresh as it gets

89
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,520
[Applause]

90
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,639
if you ever have the opportunity to eat

91
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,600
fresh from a honeybee height it's

92
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,160
amazing

93
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,840
[Applause]

94
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
unbelievable

95
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,479
there are three types of bees in every

96
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,520
colony

97
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,800
you have the drones the workers

98
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,680
and the queen bee the queen bee is the

99
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,520
most distinctive bee

100
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,039
she's the biggest she has a very

101
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,039
distinctive abdomen so she's easy to

102
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,520
spot if you know what you're looking for

103
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,039
she can lay up to 1 500 eggs a day

104
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,199
and she gets to tell all the other bees

105
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,800
what to do

106
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,560
so let's talk about drones drones are

107
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,919
the male bees in the hive they have

108
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,880
one sole purpose and that is to mate

109
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,280
with the queen

110
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,840
worker bees feed the drones throughout

111
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,880
the entire

112
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,919
season just so they can then try and

113
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,759
mate with the queen

114
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,880
if they do so successfully they die if

115
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,680
they don't

116
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
the worker bees who've been working

117
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,680
their asses off the whole

118
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,759
season will kick them out and let them

119
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,759
starve to death

120
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,360
now to the work bees

121
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,800
the work bees are the females the girls

122
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
and of course they're the ones doing all

123
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,560
the work

124
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,759
they tend the hive they tend the queen

125
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,960
they live roughly for 63 days

126
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,400
that's their cycle and then they die

127
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,280
leaving no offspring worker bees lack

128
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,560
full reproductive capacity

129
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,319
okay so here i have

130
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,280
a jar of honey it's 500 grams

131
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,479
let's put that in some context

132
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,080
one worker bee in her whole lifetime

133
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,360
can produce a by about five grams

134
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,479
so roughly one teaspoon that means

135
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,319
for this jar it takes 100

136
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,840
worker bees whole life

137
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,039
to fill it that's pretty impressive

138
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,479
considering that their brain is only

139
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,719
a sesame seed big

140
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,520
from the bees and ready to talk to you

141
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
about social engineering

142
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,279
the basics so

143
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:43,439
pancakes con 2020 quarantine edition

144
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,279
and let's get started talking about

145
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,519
my most favorite topic social

146
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,959
engineering

147
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,320
so social engineering is often seen as

148
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,360
fishing spearfishing or whaling as you

149
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,399
can see here

150
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,320
but i believe it's much more than just

151
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,160
those topics

152
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,560
covered social engineering we're in

153
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,839
social engineering

154
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,240
we actually talk about shoulder surfing

155
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,600
pretexting

156
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,040
ego whaling the use of ego as an attack

157
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,519
vector

158
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,760
actually because ego is one of the best

159
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,680
attack vectors you can use

160
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
it's about the use for instance of

161
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,120
authority

162
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,080
for your attack vectors it's tailgating

163
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,200
it's liking it's baiting etc etc

164
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,279
you can also look in the book you will

165
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,120
receive the ebook for free

166
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,200
and you can have a look there i have

167
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,880
sorted this out there in much more

168
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,839
detail than we

169
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,160
can cover here within this short amount

170
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
of time

171
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,720
as for social engineering i believe

172
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,399
there must be a better definition what

173
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,160
social engineering actually means and

174
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,440
what it entails

175
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,680
so i have a definition for social

176
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,120
engineering myself

177
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,920
it's the elicitation of information from

178
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,560
systems

179
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,000
networks human beings through methods

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,839
and tools

181
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,839
but what is social engineering still no

182
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,760
answer about social engineering actually

183
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,200
is

184
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
as a matter of fact i will compare it

185
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,839
with this for me it's actually finding

186
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,800
the gemmy the crowbar the emotional

187
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,880
crowbar

188
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,640
to attach and then push who can become a

189
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,079
social engineer

190
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,160
i believe everyone can become a social

191
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,200
engineer

192
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,000
it's not just like technical people or

193
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,360
people from other fields

194
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,200
i think it's a good mix it's also a good

195
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,040
mix of skills and knowledge

196
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,680
you need to acquire or you can acquire

197
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,839
or you can bring to the table to social

198
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,519
engineering engagements

199
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,000
or to attack vector definitions so for

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,800
instance

201
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,920
if you like to work with people you

202
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,680
maybe can work in the front line of

203
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,959
social engineering

204
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,640
if you like to work on tools and

205
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,240
programs and processes

206
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,079
you can work in the background of social

207
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,959
engineering attacks

208
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,240
so what are you looking for as a social

209
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,560
engineer specifically so that you can

210
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,399
leverage so that you can use your

211
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,200
crowbar

212
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,600
or your chemi so you're looking for out

213
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,480
of character

214
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,640
behavior for instance or you're looking

215
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,760
for emotionally

216
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,720
loaded areas so there you will have the

217
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,000
most success because

218
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,480
there you can generate leverage and

219
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,800
actually use your attack vector

220
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,880
a general attack vector or one you have

221
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,560
specifically designed

222
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,839
for maybe a person an event or even a

223
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
company

224
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,480
i found one of the most important skills

225
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,240
for a social engineer

226
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,360
is actually observation mirroring

227
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,720
and then adopting and this because

228
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,639
if you are working in different places

229
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,200
of the world in different cultures

230
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,839
you need first you need to see how it

231
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:04,800
works there

232
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,959
for instance also at the party how do

233
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,560
people eat behave

234
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,639
do they shake hands or not nowadays

235
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,079
probably not so

236
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,160
you need to get the gist of the culture

237
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,600
so these skills are actually

238
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,240
very important for a social engineer

239
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,839
also if you want to blend in

240
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,240
if you want to disappear in a crowd and

241
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,279
not stand out

242
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,839
then probably you observe first and then

243
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,519
you start mirroring the behavior

244
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,839
of the other people around you and then

245
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,440
you adapt

246
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,320
to the behavior

247
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,160
this is actually more of a technical

248
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,040
expression

249
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,000
what i believe would be just fantastic

250
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,160
if you could download this

251
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,800
um to the human beings as a software

252
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,600
release

253
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,240
that would be absolutely fantastic but

254
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,040
of course

255
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,760
that won't work

256
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,040
so let's look at the at the history

257
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,360
of social engineering or let's say corn

258
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,320
artists

259
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,160
that we had here we have some examples

260
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,320
of some cone artists we have frank

261
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,279
abignale

262
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,440
you know that maybe him from movie catch

263
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,560
me if you can

264
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,519
i actually met him in australia once

265
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,240
he's

266
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,040
quite the likable guy then we have

267
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
different prospects here we have kevin

268
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,079
foster

269
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,519
bernard madoff or bernie madoff

270
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,760
the so infamous ponzi scheme

271
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,680
then if you go further on this side

272
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,199
yep let's we have

273
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,079
william cloner victor lustig

274
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,320
charles ponzi and william thompson

275
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,199
and by the way the ponzi scheme is not a

276
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,560
pyramid scheme

277
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,920
they are different for what they do

278
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,639
so from this side here i thought i want

279
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,000
to talk to you about

280
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,240
victor lustig because he is quite

281
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,519
interesting

282
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,560
it's also interesting because uh lustig

283
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,760
or lustig

284
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,800
means funny in german so it's victor

285
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,360
funny actually and i was reading his

286
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,680
story i thought that's quite interesting

287
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,800
what he actually pulled up so he was

288
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,160
basically the guy

289
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,639
who in 1925 sold the eiffel tower twice

290
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,600
back then it was the leftover of the

291
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,839
world

292
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,120
australia and he went then to the

293
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,959
authorities and said he can sell

294
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,240
the eiffel tower for scrap value

295
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
which then some investors believe to

296
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,000
make the deal of their lives

297
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,800
and invested in the scrap metal value of

298
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,560
the eiffel tower

299
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,040
then when he sold it the first time the

300
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,160
people he coned

301
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,680
were so embarrassed to go to the police

302
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,040
or talk to anyone

303
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,680
they didn't tell no one so he then

304
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,079
thought

305
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,560
all right if that worked once let's just

306
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,839
make it work twice

307
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,680
and he actually sold the eiffel tower

308
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,920
twice the foie

309
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,000
then on this side here you see what's

310
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,720
called romanian box

311
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
and i think what he did there was even

312
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,399
more astonishing

313
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,199
so he created a quite complex and nice

314
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,800
looking wooden box

315
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,320
with a lot of hands on it with this box

316
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,199
he make believe his victims believe that

317
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,000
they can make

318
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,199
copies of one thousand dollar notes

319
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,759
of course victor lustig manipulated the

320
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,480
machine

321
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,880
and he put in a one thousand dollar note

322
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,120
and the second one

323
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,440
so when he had his first client he went

324
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,120
to them and said

325
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,560
a copying process takes about six hours

326
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,600
so he went to them said okay he's now

327
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,040
making a copy of a

328
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,279
one thousand dollar note he made the

329
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,120
first copy of the one thousand dollar

330
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,240
note

331
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
and they were waiting to make a second

332
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,040
copy of the one thousand dollar note

333
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,920
after then the client have two real one

334
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,519
thousand dollar notes

335
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,560
they really believed and were hooked on

336
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
this principle of this machine that this

337
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,519
machine could make

338
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,800
copies of real

339
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,079
banknotes so of course the

340
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,959
the tricky part here was the six hours

341
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,880
so these six hours

342
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,759
allowed victor lustig to actually then

343
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,240
remove

344
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,680
himself from the scene and he could flee

345
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,240
and of course the buying price of this

346
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,480
me of this machine was astonishingly

347
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,600
high

348
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,279
so i thought this is really a guy who

349
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,120
pulled this in 1926

350
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,680
actually with the romanian box which is

351
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,959
quite astonishing

352
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,839
and also it shows a bit how people think

353
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,959
and how people

354
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,079
react so people do really believe

355
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,120
things which are too good to be true so

356
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,839
it's quite amazing

357
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,800
let's have a look at the engagement

358
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,040
management method so the book was not

359
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,480
just written for fun

360
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,000
it was actually written with the

361
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,599
different purposes in mind

362
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,039
so for instance it should help you as a

363
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,679
maybe new engineer entering social

364
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,319
engineering

365
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,640
it can help you as a company maybe

366
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,839
making more business

367
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,319
so maybe instead of just offering pen

368
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,720
testing services you can also offer

369
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,000
social engineering services so it

370
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,160
i know it looks quite complex and it's

371
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,599
not quite a good

372
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,440
picture but you will get a better one

373
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,720
but this actually shows

374
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,600
each process you should actually engage

375
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,000
in

376
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,679
if you're doing social engineering

377
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,840
engagement and how you should manage

378
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,480
your engagements

379
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,960
i prepared this process and basically

380
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,799
project management methodology

381
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,880
because i've been involved in many many

382
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,280
penetration testings and security audits

383
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,520
and gap analysis all over the world

384
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,000
and risk management is one of the most

385
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,520
important topics there

386
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,440
so if you have a big corporation who

387
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,600
wants to do penetration testing or for

388
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,000
instance

389
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,960
now social engineering testing services

390
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,559
you need to have a method in place

391
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,559
so you can work with them so you can

392
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,600
reproduce

393
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,320
the same results year over year and you

394
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,200
apply the same testing methodology

395
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,440
within maybe one engagement or

396
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,320
internationally

397
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,799
within the different areas i think it's

398
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,360
a very

399
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,840
important part of the work as a social

400
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,600
engineer

401
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,160
now i will show you something which i

402
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,640
believe

403
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,679
is at the core of this whole social

404
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,240
engineering engagement framework

405
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,039
i created with my colleague i believe

406
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,000
this is the most

407
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,320
important bit and if you don't remember

408
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,039
anything

409
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,480
about it remember this it's very easy

410
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,600
it's like basically an ample system so

411
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,960
it shows red

412
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,480
green orange and of course black as well

413
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,720
what it means if you're engaging in

414
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,240
social engineering services

415
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,919
within the green area you are okay

416
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,120
these are services you can execute

417
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,039
you know your customer you know your

418
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,039
project you know what you're doing

419
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,200
so these services can be just executed

420
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,320
fine

421
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,600
if you're engaging in services

422
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,760
which have a risk level of orange you

423
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,200
need to consider

424
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,880
at least need to consider from your

425
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,640
company perspective if you want to

426
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,520
engage in those type of services

427
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,039
the same then applies to the red

428
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,559
services

429
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,640
as a company and in the commercial

430
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,760
environment

431
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,360
actually i think there is no need to

432
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,600
actually think of engaging

433
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,919
in social engineering services which

434
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,080
have a risk rating of red

435
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,720
it's completely unnecessary but also you

436
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,120
can use this chart as your personal

437
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,200
ethics charts you can say i do

438
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,880
penetration testings

439
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,039
if i have the necessary risk letters

440
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,559
signed or i do

441
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,960
these and these services also on the

442
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,720
other hand you can say i will not engage

443
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,679
in services

444
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,799
which might have or bear the possibility

445
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,600
that i will commit a crime for instance

446
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,240
so

447
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,799
some things um what comes to my mind

448
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,480
just right now is um

449
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,840
you know lots of people engaging in

450
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,600
social engineering and thinking oh it's

451
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,280
great and i will have maybe an

452
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,480
id and i fake an id or i will fake a

453
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,520
document

454
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,880
to get myself an entry or maybe a badge

455
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,280
for that matter but the problem is if

456
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,000
you do this

457
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,039
it's forging documents and

458
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,000
forging documents is actually a felony

459
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
so it's a major crime

460
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,080
and if you have committed once a major

461
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,000
crime for just like a stupid social

462
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,280
engineering engagement

463
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,919
it's really bad it will stick to you it

464
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,440
will stick to your record

465
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,520
so always make sure before you're

466
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,400
engaging in social engineering services

467
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,880
or for that matter of any sort of

468
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,840
engagements

469
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,880
you are asked to do for a client what's

470
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,000
behind them

471
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,720
is there any specific risk for instance

472
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,159
so maybe i will talk a bit more

473
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,360
about that one later

474
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,600
then attack vector development attack

475
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,200
vector development

476
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,919
looks a bit like that so we do have

477
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,640
different

478
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,679
attack vectors which of course um are

479
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,679
depending on the task or on the amount

480
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,679
of budget you have to develop an attack

481
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,559
vector

482
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,799
and also depending on your target so on

483
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,240
the

484
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,840
well maybe it's on the left hand side

485
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,440
from you

486
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,000
is the effort at the cost development

487
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,120
attack vector

488
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,799
on this side is the importance of the

489
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,880
engagement or task of course if you do

490
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,679
have

491
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,840
not a lot of time and not a lot of money

492
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,679
to develop attack vectors

493
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,760
you are staying to the standard attack

494
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,280
vectors avs

495
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
i will show you some of them later if

496
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,559
you go up the curve

497
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,120
you have more specific and dedicated and

498
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,679
very

499
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,799
detailed attack vectors scr map is a

500
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,240
very specific map

501
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,320
we do that social engineering engagement

502
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,840
framework you can do

503
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,120
psyc profiling nlp guild e6 you do

504
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,159
whaling

505
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,440
you do can use the muscle of hierarchy

506
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,200
of needs for instance to create attack

507
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,000
vectors

508
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,320
and so on and so on so this chart

509
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,600
actually shows you

510
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,679
in what type of attack vector you want

511
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,520
to engage and of course they have an

512
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,080
impact

513
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,559
on cost

514
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,679
as here you can see for attack vector

515
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,200
development

516
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,520
is the division 3 on the left hand side

517
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,280
do you want to use a standard attack

518
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,039
vector which is available

519
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,840
which has a description which you know

520
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,000
the expected results of this attack

521
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,960
vector

522
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,120
which can be scaled is already developed

523
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,480
and doesn't need a lot of time

524
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,919
to being rolled out you talk about here

525
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:40,240
uh

526
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,400
maybe like phishing emails phishing

527
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,640
email templates for instance

528
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,559
here you see some other standard attack

529
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,480
vectors like impersonation

530
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,600
dumpster diving and eavesdropping

531
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,520
but with all these attack vectors and

532
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,880
that's also in the book then

533
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,480
you need to make sure about the risk

534
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
you're engaging with so for these ones i

535
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,360
have

536
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,120
a definition of risk management for

537
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,559
dumpster diving

538
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,039
um there's certain risk with it because

539
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,720
if you're on the property of the company

540
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,679
you cannot just

541
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,240
take their dumpsters or their garbage

542
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,000
out you wouldn't be allowed

543
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,240
it would be a crime in the public you

544
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,520
have to be careful

545
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,000
uh where the dumps or where the bin is

546
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,760
actually to take some documents out so

547
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,200
there are some refinements with these

548
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,640
attack vectors but these are

549
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,200
pretty the general standard attack

550
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,600
vectors

551
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,799
now i will show you the

552
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,600
let me click to the next slide here

553
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,360
here's the whole um attack

554
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,880
or attack methodology it's

555
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,799
pretty bad welcome back to my next part

556
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,679
about social engineering uh i was cut

557
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,320
out

558
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,240
battery died on me but now let's

559
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,640
continue with that topic

560
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,919
so the next topic i want to introduce

561
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,520
you is this

562
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,760
this is the whole process basically from

563
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,440
information collection

564
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,919
through information documentation

565
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,520
through the development of an attack

566
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,559
vector

567
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,600
through the approach selection method so

568
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,120
let's have a look quickly

569
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,679
at those individual items here

570
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,279
information collection so you need to

571
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,960
collect the information to create your

572
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,480
attack vectors

573
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
as a first bit so you can either buy

574
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,760
this information

575
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,559
or you can make it so it's open source

576
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,559
intelligence for instance

577
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,279
um different intelligence report you can

578
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,320
buy

579
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,080
you can send out the red team blue

580
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,080
teaming collecting this information

581
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,559
and then based on this information

582
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,080
you're documenting

583
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,960
the information so either it's

584
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,840
fact-based

585
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,240
documentation of information so

586
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,880
basically

587
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,159
raw information or it's

588
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:52,640
intelligence-based

589
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,200
information intelligence-based means

590
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
there has been information

591
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,840
and people or maybe machines artificial

592
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,120
intelligence whatever

593
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,799
has made decisions on what this

594
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,919
information means

595
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,400
so they made an interpretation of the

596
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,520
information

597
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,600
which is totally okay out of this you

598
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,960
have a work paper

599
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,679
report or you have a classification this

600
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:16,559
then flows

601
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,200
into the attack vector development so

602
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,720
because it's the basis

603
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,039
for developing your attack vector you

604
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,360
need information you need intelligence

605
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,960
you need okay how does workflow work at

606
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,679
company xy set for phishing initiatives

607
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,200
you need to know the organizational

608
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,880
structures of companies

609
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,440
uh money flows etc so this information

610
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,559
flows then into the attack vector

611
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,279
and in there you do the analysis and you

612
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,400
select

613
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,320
what might work best as your attack

614
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,520
vector

615
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,320
based on the topic you want to achieve

616
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,080
after that you have defined your attack

617
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,880
vector

618
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,520
you actually select the approach how do

619
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,200
you deliver this attack vector do you

620
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,360
have to deliver it simultaneously

621
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,240
on multiple places internationally is it

622
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,600
person based

623
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,679
attack vectors for christmas with santa

624
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,039
claus don't really work

625
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,600
at easter for instance and so on and so

626
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,159
forth

627
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,799
and then you exploit that's the whole

628
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,600
process

629
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,520
in one picture basically so let's

630
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,559
click to the next slide how do you

631
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,520
develop the

632
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,720
specific attack vector so this is then

633
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,919
how we develop

634
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,039
the specific attack vectors so we decide

635
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,919
is person-based attack vector or this is

636
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,039
a technology-based

637
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,039
attack vector so either you send person

638
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,840
in to collect information for instance

639
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,960
intelligence or you're sending them

640
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,159
files for instance malware etc

641
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,919
then you have open site and remote

642
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,600
option location

643
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,120
you have to go to a specific place

644
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,039
because it's a physical location

645
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,679
or you can do it remotely sending emails

646
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,080
sending

647
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,919
files making phone calls etc

648
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,600
then here you define the actual attack

649
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,120
vector because everyone would love to

650
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,279
develop attack vectors

651
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,240
with endless money and endless time but

652
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,279
in the business world

653
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,200
this is not going to work and also you

654
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,880
need to be risk-averse so

655
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,559
usually big corporations don't really

656
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,000
like to engage in

657
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,440
big risks for operations so

658
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,480
you then define what we call the attack

659
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,039
vector

660
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,760
principle so is it well known attack

661
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,039
vector

662
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,240
or is it a dedicated specific attack

663
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,880
vector

664
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,120
the principle you can see here is this

665
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,399
bit so

666
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,200
either you use nestle pyramid is an

667
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,640
attack vector

668
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,120
scr map nlp galdena6 social media mice

669
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,320
curiosity most often it's curiosity

670
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,279
so for instance in phishing emails it's

671
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,360
a competition you want something

672
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,039
so you kind of um play on the

673
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,120
factor of curiosity of everyone in an

674
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
email in a phone call in whatever

675
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,399
uh winnings earnings etc deception of

676
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,200
course

677
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,559
ceo fraud is based on this principle um

678
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,760
it's time based so sending out phishing

679
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,000
emails maybe friday four o'clock is

680
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,520
better than sending them out

681
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,360
monday at nine where everyone is in the

682
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,880
office

683
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,159
you use the principle of authority of

684
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,720
scarcity something is limited edition

685
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,440
and scarce for instance

686
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,880
you play on the helplessness of the

687
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,720
victims on the politeness for instance

688
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,600
scanning or intimidation charity

689
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,000
persuasion techniques

690
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,240
so distance will then be combined when

691
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,080
you have one selected this part

692
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,760
with the sweet spots weaknesses and

693
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,919
strengths or out of character behavior

694
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,360
you have based on your information

695
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,399
collection

696
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,360
so of course for me for instance if i'm

697
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,440
heavily involved in the beekeeping and

698
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,279
honey and all this stuff maybe you can

699
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:53,919
send me

700
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,240
phishing emails about honey a new

701
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,640
discovery of a fantastic b

702
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,600
so obviously i would then be curious

703
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,200
about this and read it open the

704
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,520
attachment eventually etc

705
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,000
uh the beliefs and influence or

706
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,799
emotional and financial pressures or

707
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,440
out of character behaviors now this is

708
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,559
important too

709
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,600
these are the constraints because

710
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,360
you won't have endless time and then

711
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,679
this money usually so you have

712
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,440
during with the time you have available

713
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,000
create a good attack vector

714
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,520
also the chances of success are

715
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,200
important sometimes you can only make

716
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,240
one offs

717
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,919
you have one chance to get something

718
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,520
right another then

719
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,039
if it's not going to work with this

720
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,120
attack vector phishing emails campaign

721
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,520
etc you have to go for another route

722
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,240
or people they inform each other if they

723
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,720
found out about the suspicious email

724
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,880
they will talk faster then you can send

725
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,039
a second phishing email

726
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,880
um etc so this is now the constraints

727
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,679
money wise skills wise intensity level

728
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,799
wise of course

729
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,279
and then we go into this i explained

730
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,720
this to you before

731
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,840
do a you engage only in green

732
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,360
level services orange or red or you say

733
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,279
okay i only do the black stuff

734
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,520
who knows usually it's enough if you

735
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,760
engage in green level to get repeatable

736
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,360
and results which are relevant on a

737
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,559
corporate level

738
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,279
it's totally unnecessary to go to a

739
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,120
deeper more risky level

740
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,520
and then you have the grc which is also

741
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,880
setting the boundaries it's about

742
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,200
culture and it's about respect

743
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
so this is how you compromise an attack

744
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,360
vector if you once defined one

745
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,120
you keep it basically in your database

746
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,279
and you pull it up for the next time

747
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,799
and you adjust the settings maybe of

748
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,039
culture of language and of setting

749
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,039
and the specific sector maybe a company

750
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,000
or a business system

751
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,480
let's click to the next slide

752
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,360
here just a is a bit of additional

753
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,559
information

754
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,000
around personal space how that actually

755
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,120
works and

756
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,799
the part we actually call the reaction

757
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,440
zone

758
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,039
now it has definitely changed with

759
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,360
corona people have more distance

760
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,840
towards each other physically hopefully

761
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,960
not emotionally

762
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,480
but that's the basic as a social

763
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,000
engineer you need to know a couple of

764
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,559
basics

765
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,120
if you work with people around people

766
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,480
talk to people

767
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,039
and try to make them what you actually

768
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,000
want to make them

769
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,240
to do so you have a specific soul in the

770
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,120
middle where

771
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,440
you are the person here this is the

772
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,200
intimate zone

773
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,120
and it's about the family which is

774
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,279
usually in this intimate zone

775
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,600
uh then on the outer circle you have

776
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,200
like a personal zone

777
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,960
which friends the social zone were

778
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
colleagues in the public zone

779
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,200
of course it looks different now it's

780
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,720
definitely changed

781
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,640
um this but this is just roughly gives

782
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
you an idea and the reaction zone

783
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,080
basically just means

784
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,640
if you approach a person within this

785
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,600
zone

786
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,720
maybe now with corona is exactly the 2

787
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,200
meters or 1.5 meters they recommend

788
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,120
you will definitely provoke a reaction

789
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,039
so maybe you want that

790
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,960
maybe you don't want that so just keep

791
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,880
that in mind if you're approaching a

792
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,640
person it's always like

793
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,320
a gate and for each of these gates

794
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,960
you have to kind of like to get the

795
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,159
formal permission or

796
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,559
informal permission to approach a person

797
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,320
otherwise the person will react

798
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,720
fight the flight and either leave or you

799
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,240
won't get what you actually want from

800
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,519
that person so you need to ask for

801
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,039
permission you can be

802
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,360
as sometimes say coughing but it is not

803
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,080
a good

804
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,480
methodology now you can drop your keys

805
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,519
you can

806
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,159
nestle on your phone your phone can ring

807
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,039
and then you get

808
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,640
you know this person's attention and

809
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,480
then you can walk further but if you're

810
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,039
running very fast towards this zone here

811
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,960
you get an unwanted reaction

812
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,600
let's click to the next slide this is

813
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,840
just a bit of more theory for you but i

814
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,159
will go very quickly over the

815
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,320
sounds of approach it's very

816
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,000
uncomfortable being approached from the

817
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,919
back it's a bit different for women and

818
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:02,320
men

819
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,799
in the perception women have a bit tend

820
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,960
to have a bit a wider angle acceptable

821
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,360
angle

822
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,840
i guess it's because they're watching

823
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,360
out then maybe men

824
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,200
so best approaches in the green zone

825
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,039
obviously you approach the person from

826
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,519
the front

827
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,960
it's a a bit more different in this

828
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,080
context

829
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,080
military personnel they don't like to

830
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,159
get approached from any direction

831
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,760
except from the front where you're

832
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,000
talking to them so keep that in mind

833
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,000
here we just have very quickly a diagram

834
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,840
about touching a person

835
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,679
on the body which you actually should

836
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,039
not in no

837
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,399
culture or in no areas of the world this

838
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,600
is probably okay

839
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,120
but just to give you an ear totally

840
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,720
taboo or this areas here

841
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,360
for men it's a bit more in the shoulders

842
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,840
like

843
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,919
a tap on the shoulders you also can get

844
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,200
kills for that one but

845
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,039
it's more acceptable maybe around the

846
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,320
hands uh

847
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,039
you you could probably touch a person it

848
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:03,360
um

849
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,440
with the women different i will just

850
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,279
show you that

851
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,440
just need to click to the next slide

852
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,119
so click with women um

853
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,359
it's like this picture so it's really

854
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,760
only could be okay and it depends on the

855
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,800
culture as well

856
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,560
where you can actually touch another

857
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,800
person

858
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,280
but nowadays it's any way to touch

859
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,480
another person's

860
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,760
so now bringing this to um you know some

861
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,480
practical use this whole model i just

862
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,159
showed you very quickly

863
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,639
um if you approach a person sitting on a

864
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,079
desk like this

865
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,320
obviously never approach this person

866
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
from the back it's very uncomfortable

867
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,520
for my person

868
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,199
for the person it's not because maybe

869
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,879
the person's searching porn or doing

870
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,399
something other than illegal

871
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,480
it's just very uncomfortable and we'll

872
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,520
never have a good start

873
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,199
talking this person also keep that in

874
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,760
mind if you're maybe a team leader

875
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,720
of sort that you approach a person

876
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,400
preferably from the front

877
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,560
you don't see the screen of the person

878
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,400
you are polite to this person

879
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,240
and then you can have a good rapport

880
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
with this person

881
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,000
also make sure that you don't sit on a

882
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,359
person's desk

883
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,599
because that's a big no-go that's very

884
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,640
aggressive

885
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,280
passive aggressive move so just keep

886
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,240
this in mind

887
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,400
if you approach a person wherever you

888
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,800
are in whatever context you are

889
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,119
it's a good good thing to keep in mind

890
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,800
how you make another person comfortable

891
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,839
talking to you

892
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,680
then here i just work through a bit

893
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,400
more about the target selection for a

894
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,720
person company or a place

895
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,720
where do you get your targets how do you

896
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,320
get them it's about open source

897
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,160
intelligence it's about

898
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,520
making use of information available

899
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,079
but here are a couple of hints what you

900
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,680
can actually do

901
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
depending what you want to if you want

902
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,040
to

903
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,200
get in touch or get to know people from

904
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,520
conferences like pancakes

905
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,359
con for instance you go to these

906
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,359
conferences you see these types of

907
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,880
people there but also you know from

908
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,040
experience that maybe

909
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,480
people from this and this company you

910
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,560
should go to this pub so you can go in

911
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,240
there if you want information

912
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:23,118
so this is just like a help for target

913
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,079
selection

914
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,200

[Music]

933
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:40,820
[Laughter]

934
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,859
[Music]

935
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,839
[Music]

936
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,839
um

937
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:19,839
and um

938
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
um

939
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,839

940
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,839

941
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,839
oh

942
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,839
oh

943
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,839
oh

944
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,359
um

945
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,319
and now let's quickly go back to the

946
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,200
bread

947
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,520
the bread test as you can see

948
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,599
this one has formed a crust

949
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,160
it's already like hard

950
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,280
look at this piece of bread

951
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,400
you know that's more more soggy there's

952
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,040
a

953
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,480
soaked up ketchup

954
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,319
this piece of bread even when i break it

955
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,839
i can feel it with

956
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,800
then it looks like this so if you would

957
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,319
have fake honey

958
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:21,839
it would end up

959
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,839
um

960
00:41:54,150 --> 00:42:03,070
[Laughter]

961
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,370
okay

962
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:22,830
[Laughter]

963
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,960
so

964
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,040
is there is another test

965
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,319
we can do with fire so we just take a

966
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,480
match

967
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,440
and a piece of paper

968
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,079
as you can see

969
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,359
quickly the paper burns so

970
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,560
now we take a bit of honey

971
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,760
put it on top of the paper

972
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,480
oh take another match

973
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,960
now we will try to light that paper

974
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,359
again

975
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,880
you can see there where the honey is

976
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,760
paper doesn't burn

977
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,839
so that's the properties of honey

978
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,230
fantastic

979
00:43:55,230 --> 00:44:00,210
[Laughter]

980
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:14,990

[Music]

982
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,839
okay

983
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,839
oh

984
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:50,770
[Laughter]

985
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,829
[Music]

986
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:05,839
um

987
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:17,049
[Music]

988
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:30,430
[Laughter]

989
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,839
okay

990
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:39,839
foreign
