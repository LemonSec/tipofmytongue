1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,399
it's a home bird's sack it's your show

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,560
man

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,800
okay um can you see my screen

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,240
we can are you gonna engage your webcam

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,720
um yes i will

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,520
perfect okay okay um

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,760
quarantine life is interesting so change

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,359
of plans instead of doing this

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,920
in the kitchen with a full demo i am now

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,400
in

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,320
a nursery as you can see crib back there

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,800
not my normal office space but we're

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,760
flexible

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,360
so um powershell

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,399
and pickling um if i'm

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,039
being honest i did not think this would

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:45,440
be

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,879
an accepted talk i just thought it was a

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,719
funny alliteration and it was two things

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,320
that i knew that both started with p

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,520
and it i'm glad it took off um

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,960
and i've had a really good response from

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,800
it so far so um

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,719
this is supposed to be introductory so

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,399
if you know much about powershell or

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,039
pickling

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,119
um this may be basic but i hope there's

28
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,159
something for everyone

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,880
in here um okay

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,759
but i'm gonna this is gonna be pretty

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,759
nothing on the slides this is just for a

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,080
bit

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,280
in the background um i'm going to

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,000
um if you look on powershell pickles the

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,119
hashtag

36
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,759
homebrew tech or i'll have my website um

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,680
at the end you will see

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,680
i'll post um the resources

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,759
for you to get more information on all

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,880
of this um

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,680
as well as my github with some

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,920
powershell resources so

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,280
i'm gonna go to

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,720
demo mode open up notepad plus plus

45
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,640
um like i said this is 100 demo here

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,560
um i'm gonna show hopefully basics

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,600
um but some of this may be a little more

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
advanced so powershell

49
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,119
um we think of this a lot in

50
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,800
for windows um as a sysadmin

51
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,520
i use it every day i tell people all the

52
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,400
time that

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000
microsoft is trying to make it harder

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,520
and harder to use their guise and if you

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,239
want to use

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,680
if you want to get the information you

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,120
need you need to use powershell um

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,640
but it's not just for windows system

59
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,160
admins you could use it with linux this

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,440
is not going to cover linux at all

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,959
because i have never installed

62
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,920
powershell on linux but it is useful and

63
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,840
most of these same concepts will work

64
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,560
um but

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,160
i so so for me as a window sysadmin

66
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,640
what i'm using all all day long let me

67
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,920
increase

68
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,640
this zoom quite a bit um

69
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,319
what is that that is gonna be

70
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,280
okay um

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,760
so every every command in powershell

72
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,080
starts with a verb that verb

73
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360
in a lot of cases is going to be get

74
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,680
or there there's a list online i will

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,879
post it

76
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,080
of all of the the verbs are get add

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,120
remove

78
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,159
um search things like that um

79
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,040
so something that i use all the time is

80
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,360
get

81
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,159
a d computer or get a user for active

82
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:28,959
directory

83
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,239
i'm not going to go into that but

84
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,319
there's a ton you can do with it um

85
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,040
what i will do

86
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,599
is and if you have a windows computer

87
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,640
powershell is open for you there

88
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,238
all the time um

89
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,040
okay

90
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,920
so i'm going to something that's

91
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,959
extremely useful

92
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,720
is get child item um

93
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,439
honestly ls and der will do exactly the

94
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,799
same thing they're all

95
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,959
um they're all aliased but i'm gonna

96
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,239
call it get child item

97
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,760
for right now because this is powershell

98
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,798
and it shows you get is your verb and

99
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,279
child

100
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,040
item is is your noun what you're trying

101
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,079
to get

102
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,759
so um

103
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,440
you they're they're set child on them as

104
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,960
well that's a lot that's

105
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,320
not going to come into play but so

106
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,240
okay get child item um

107
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,360
if if as you see in my initial get child

108
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,960
item

109
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
there's not very much information here

110
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,639
but if i do get child item

111
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,880
fl format list but then if i don't

112
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,800
specify what i want in

113
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,840
you know i'm going to spell it out for

114
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,080
you all because

115
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,919
um again i i'm so used to aliasing

116
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,560
but fl will be a lot easier for you but

117
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,600
format list

118
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
um you get everything it'll show you

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,960
literally

120
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,680
all of your commands um all of the

121
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,199
attributes that you can pull

122
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,039
and that's really useful if you don't

123
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,720
know the command lit

124
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,000
much and you don't know what you could

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,919
be getting from it because if you don't

126
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,120
know what information you're trying to

127
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,520
parse

128
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,919
then fl will just tell you every single

129
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,400
thing that you can get and then you can

130
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,440
you can pull from there um now

131
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,240
for me i would do a lot of where you

132
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,639
know

133
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,680
name like

134
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,960
something but i personally think if

135
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,160
you're learning and you're just trying

136
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,840
to get information the easiest thing

137
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,240
is to export to csv

138
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,280
and x and then you can parse in in excel

139
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,360
um and then but you can do a lot of the

140
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,039
same things in the command line um

141
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,240
okay so that's just very

142
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,039
um so so where is is essentially your

143
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,680
one-liner

144
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,960
um is your one-liner equivalent of if

145
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,960
so where and then this

146
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,639
um this variable right here

147
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,160
that underscore means where the item

148
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,479
from

149
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,199
from the pipe before so this is where

150
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,360
everything that i got in child item

151
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,199
um and it's going to do essentially for

152
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,800
each loop and sort

153
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,240
or an if rather and

154
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,720
you know sort on name and you may be

155
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
used to other programming languages

156
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,520
where you have equal

157
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,759
equal equal things like that powershell

158
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,639
is going to be eq

159
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,240
or like or

160
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,520
not equals again i'm not trying to go

161
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,280
in depth with that i'm going to send you

162
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,160
to resources at the end on my website

163
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,319
but um you you treat this very much like

164
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,840
an if block so i've shown you a bit of

165
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,039
the of powershell scripting here in

166
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,160
in the powershell console

167
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,599
but the other side of powershell is

168
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,000
dot ps1 is your actual command list that

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,960
you can write

170
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,639
um this is a fairly simple example here

171
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,160
that i'm going to

172
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,120
just pick out a few

173
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,599
a few things that i've done in this

174
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,000
command commandlet that can apply to

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,199
other things

176
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,840
so um

177
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,758
parameters every

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,840
every powershell command that you use

179
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,160
for example that that get child item

180
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,319
it's going to have parameters now if i

181
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,080
ran this i could tab complete and get

182
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,520
all my parameters but um

183
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,919
this is so for inputs i really like to

184
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,440
add parameters so that i can

185
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,479
universalize the

186
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,360
the script that i'm writing if you don't

187
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,720
have these then you have then someone

188
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,599
has to come in

189
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,800
and and change the actual script instead

190
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,560
if you have a parameter you can change

191
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,080
it on the fly in the command line you

192
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,879
can say ah

193
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,440
this time i want to send an email this

194
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,680
time i want to

195
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,599
run no output to console this time i

196
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,599
want it to just report only

197
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,879
um and what this script is is an active

198
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,400
directory cleanup process that's not

199
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,879
important

200
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,720
i'm just going to show you a few of the

201
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,560
decision logics in here and a few of the

202
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,240
things that you can do

203
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,440
with powershell through this so

204
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,039
um you see all these these parameters up

205
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,759
here

206
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,440
um and i i didn't cover it at the

207
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,039
beginning but one of the things i love

208
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,760
about powershell and why

209
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,559
it's my language of choice is that this

210
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,320
is plain language

211
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,360
um there there's there's no obfuscation

212
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,839
here

213
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,839
commandlet binding uh you're doing

214
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,680
binding for your commandlet param

215
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,839
i assume that parameter parameter

216
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,440
mandatory

217
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,920
is false this is a switch it's quiet

218
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,600
there there's no abbreviations there's

219
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,880
no anything this is

220
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,839
this is clear language and i just think

221
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,640
that this is

222
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,600
i i like to use powershell even in times

223
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,760
where something like python may work

224
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,640
better because a lot of systems use it

225
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,240
it's a lot more universal

226
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,160
it's installed on almost every windows

227
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,600
computer which is great if you're trying

228
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,720
to live off the land

229
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
as a red teamer i'm blue team all the

230
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,320
way so i don't fully think that way but

231
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,880
to me i i use that same live off the

232
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,560
land concept to just think if i write

233
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,680
something in powershell

234
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,839
then it's a little more universally ex

235
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,040
um

236
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,080
used because now i can hand this to any

237
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,800
sis admin

238
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,560
and chances are they know some amount of

239
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,839
powershell

240
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,680
and it's a lot easier can you by chance

241
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,959
zoom in a little bit i've got a few

242
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,240
people on the questions here that are

243
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,440
asking if you can like do the little

244
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,080
mouse yeah

245
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,120
totally um yeah yeah

246
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,959
so because it i'm sure it looks great on

247
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,240
your screen but like coming across

248
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,760
no absolutely um so

249
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,680
okay how how much more is that good um

250
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,480
my eyes are yeah that looks phenomenally

251
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
better thank you thank you okay

252
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
so so i'm going to cover a few a few

253
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,760
things then um

254
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,920
that i just very quickly like this is

255
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,079
the example that i was saying where

256
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,959
parameter mandatory false it's it's

257
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,480
literally that simple this

258
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,000
you know the dollar sign if you're not

259
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,880
familiar with um

260
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,079
with much scripting is for variable

261
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,200
um but

262
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,160
it just it makes sense you can read that

263
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,800
in

264
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,440
even without too much knowledge know

265
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,120
what that means and that's just why i

266
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,959
like powershell and

267
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,600
it's it's really a great introductory

268
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,399
language and it's

269
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,320
really good and universal for it and

270
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,440
infosec

271
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,560
so um

272
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,040
something that that takes place in

273
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,399
almost all of my scripts

274
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,839
is get date um and

275
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,440
those can be super easy to manipulate

276
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,560
um add days and then so this day's

277
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,200
disable up there is my

278
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,399
is one of my um input parameters

279
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,440
um so

280
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,279
this is exactly what it's saying and

281
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,880
part of what i'm gonna trying to do here

282
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,440
more than even teach because 20 minutes

283
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,399
um is probably not going to teach anyone

284
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,600
from the basics

285
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,279
i want to show that this could be easy

286
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,640
this is something you can pick up and

287
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,440
play with and think

288
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
something that you can do something

289
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,399
practical with so

290
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,760
so what is this dude um today so it

291
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,360
calls back to today so it's

292
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,399
get date ad days minus stays disabled so

293
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,480
if you wanted to just specify it

294
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
manually and say

295
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,000
you could even do this in one line you

296
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,519
could do get

297
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,360
date add days minus 30.

298
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,399
you just want things older than

299
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,959
well actually at this point it's this is

300
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,720
not telling you if you want it before or

301
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,160
after you don't have a greater than or

302
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,040
less than

303
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,440
all you have in this case is i have a

304
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,519
date that's minus 30 days

305
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,120
um and again you can see in a lot of

306
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,000
ways

307
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
this is how i'm specifying my parameters

308
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,440
there's nothing magical about

309
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,959
up here except for this is just

310
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,480
something to get you from

311
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,000
userland and command the the command

312
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,760
into scriptland so

313
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,240
um this is where i'm parsing everything

314
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
i'm putting log files so

315
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,680
um this is something that i will put

316
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,519
this function generate output that i

317
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,959
actually originally got from

318
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,240
got from paul cunningham um the

319
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,959
exchange server pro guy this is

320
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,160
extremely useful

321
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,600
if you're doing anything where you're

322
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,160
making a change um i've just seen too

323
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,360
many times when you're making a

324
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,639
powershell script

325
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,959
and i have no idea why it's doing that

326
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,040
but you don't have any way of

327
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,519
fully testing it this if you're running

328
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,680
something on a schedule

329
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,639
this output will um

330
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,399
you can output to script you can output

331
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,320
to in this case

332
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,720
i in this one i do not have email but in

333
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,600
the one that i put

334
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,880
on my website and on github i will

335
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,120
have the output to email as well and

336
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,200
this is just a very easy you can pop

337
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,519
this

338
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,079
into any script and then in your

339
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,760
parameters you can say

340
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,720
quiet you can say whichever you want and

341
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,440
and pop

342
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,600
pop this out to a log file um

343
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,920
and

344
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,399
so this is how easy it could be to

345
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,920
manipulate

346
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,320
that's i think maybe a little bit small

347
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,000
i'm gonna zoom one more time

348
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,959
um okay so so this

349
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,760
right here how it's um writing to a log

350
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,839
file

351
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,399
timestamp and that timestamp is from up

352
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,240
there it just parses a get date

353
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,279
into human readable date instead of you

354
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,600
know

355
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,839
unix timestamp or whichever the default

356
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,760
is and then log entry

357
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,399
is from up here um which is input from

358
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:00,959
the

359
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,720
command line i'll show you in a second

360
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,800
where where i input log entry

361
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,880
but then you you could write anything in

362
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,560
here you could just say you know

363
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,639
test output and

364
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,839
out out file to file.txt

365
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,560
and that append just means add to the

366
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,079
end if i didn't have a pen it would

367
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,680
overwrite the whole file that's how easy

368
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,800
you can write a file

369
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,360
in powershell in powershell it's just

370
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,120
out file

371
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,839
um

372
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,480
so okay

373
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,800
um

374
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,760
now i'm not gonna go too much into these

375
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,120
this is more like i said the um

376
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,600
the this is for active directory

377
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,639
modification

378
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,279
but functions are really useful um if i

379
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,800
was doing a powershell

380
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,560
much more advanced class i would talk

381
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,199
about writing functions into modules

382
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,480
um for for right now um

383
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,519
functions are great if you're going to

384
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,040
run the same code

385
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,680
more than once pull it out so that if

386
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,120
you ever make a change to

387
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,680
this you can make a change in one place

388
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,920
and it essentially cascades instead of

389
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,959
then having to make that change in 10

390
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,920
different places

391
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,199
so um and in this i call back to my

392
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,040
my generate output so

393
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,920
i'm gonna go down show you some um

394
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,040
different ways to make

395
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,240
decisions in decision trees you know

396
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,160
ifs try catch so

397
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,560
um i'll get to the for each loop down

398
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,680
there because that's

399
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,160
i mean i have never ran a screw written

400
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,480
a script that did not have for each

401
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,720
um

402
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,040
okay so this is in my initial

403
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,639
initialization

404
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,399
honestly in power newer versions of

405
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,000
powershell four and beyond

406
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
you don't even need to add the modules

407
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,920
but i like to make my scripts as

408
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,199
um universal as possible so

409
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,240
what i mean there is that

410
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,279
in my powershell console here you

411
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,639
there's tons of

412
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,040
um command there's tons of modules out

413
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,000
there that you can

414
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,320
input uh that you can import there's

415
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,839
active directory things like that

416
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,959
but now if and i don't actually have the

417
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,800
arcset tools the active directory tools

418
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,560
on my computer so i can't add this

419
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,680
right now but just showing you an

420
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
example now in modern versions of

421
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,199
powershell if i just run

422
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,720
a command um get a d computer and i know

423
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
that's probably small um

424
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,639
but get a d computer if i run that and

425
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,399
it powershell will automatically check

426
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,000
the module and import that so

427
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
just as so for here

428
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,600
um i'm this isn't as important

429
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,279
what it's doing but i just want to show

430
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,279
you some decision

431
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,199
um logic so

432
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,959
here this essentially says if

433
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,240
this is not true so if get module

434
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,559
if if we get module where object and

435
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,400
it's empty

436
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,160
that's what this is it's essentially a

437
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,599
not equals that's what the

438
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,730
um

439
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,959
[Music]

440
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,439
exclamation uh the shift one there a

441
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,959
capital one

442
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,559
um would it means

443
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,119
if that doesn't exist so if you get

444
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,679
module

445
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,039
and there's no modules for active

446
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,880
directory you could do a lot of

447
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,400
different things there you could do

448
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
if date equals this you could do a ton

449
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,000
of things um so

450
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,440
try it's gonna try to run this but again

451
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,880
you could do a lot of different things

452
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,960
and try you could modify something

453
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,320
um i haven't shown anything in

454
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,640
modification right now because

455
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,799
i'm just trying to show you basics um

456
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,559
and then catch if it doesn't

457
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,240
if this fails catch is going to run

458
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,440
um exit means that the script is going

459
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,840
to stop running

460
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,039
um and i know i'm i'm glossing

461
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,799
over things very fast i'm just trying to

462
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,320
give a demo

463
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,480
and i do want to get to the fun stuff um

464
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,360
i i want to get to the pickling as well

465
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,200
um

466
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,520
so for each um

467
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,039
i up there have oh you that's for

468
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,559
organizational unit but you could do

469
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,600
anything

470
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,720
let me actually let let me write

471
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,440
something

472
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,679
from from scratch for a moment so you

473
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,520
can see kind of my logic and writing a

474
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,160
script

475
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,720
so um array equals

476
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,400
and i'm going to fill in an array one

477
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,559
two three

478
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,320
um and then if you do

479
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,280
for each

480
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,799
number in array

481
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,000
nope typo there

482
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,720
and that number does not exist yet that

483
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,440
is saying

484
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,880
as so each of these arrays will

485
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,039
now become every number in array will

486
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,559
become

487
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,760
a number in the resulting um

488
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,600
for each loop here um what i like to do

489
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,760
in a lot of my scripts is call this

490
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,280
numbers instead of array

491
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,000
because it it again it just plays into

492
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,480
the

493
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,760
natural language format of powershell

494
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,200
that you can see for each number and

495
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,520
numbers it makes sense

496
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,919
so you could do just as simple as

497
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,440
you could do math you could do a lot of

498
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
different things i'm just

499
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,039
for the purpose of simplicity going to

500
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,960
echo number

501
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,640
and i'll show you how this will actually

502
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,520
run um

503
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,199
get numbers

504
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,799
that's verb that's your noun

505
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,840
and then

506
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,200
and then

507
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,840
probably way big but

508
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,559
and i that cls close i like to just

509
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,159
close my screen and

510
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,120
clean and sanitize often uh it helps

511
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,320
with my 80d

512
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,439
my adhd not getting distracted so get

513
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,919
numbers and there's a ton of other

514
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:42,880
things you could do

515
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,760
you could say you could do echo the

516
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,840
number

517
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
is

518
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,919
boom um that's you know

519
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,600
fairly simple but it shows you what you

520
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,960
can do with a for

521
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,840
each um if you want to then say if

522
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,919
and this seems probably silly in such a

523
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,440
simple script but if

524
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,840
number greater than one

525
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,200
obviously the easiest way to do that

526
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,640
would be to have just pulled

527
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,919
two pulled one out of here but

528
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,880
showing some manipulation you can do and

529
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,600
now

530
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,280
it's just gonna show you two and three

531
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,360
so um

532
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,960
and you could do modification you could

533
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,640
do math you could do other things to

534
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,120
this

535
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,159
um but that for each

536
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,720
will save you in so many different

537
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,360
things

538
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,120
um just it there's so many different

539
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,559
things you can parse with it

540
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,559
um i'm gonna show you this is a bit more

541
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,480
um okay

542
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,799
this was something that i wrote and this

543
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,720
is a really practical

544
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,280
problem that you can solve generating

545
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,520
passwords um i was doing this for a lab

546
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,559
that i was giving

547
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,799
and i wanted to generate a bunch of some

548
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,600
easily

549
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,880
memor memorable numbers uh passwords

550
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,600
rather

551
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,960
so i based this on the eff

552
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,080
um script the eff um list

553
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,039
there's i think it's 30 000 words in

554
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:23,520
here

555
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,799
uh now it looks like 7777

556
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,280
words um and

557
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,799
i say i want my password length to be

558
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,640
nine characters um and then this is an

559
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,159
example of every character that i want

560
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,280
to append to it

561
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,400
i import my password file

562
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,320
where the word length is

563
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,559
longer than that length and this is get

564
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,760
this get random

565
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,880
is not great um

566
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,120
i encourage you to play around with it

567
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,919
but

568
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,880
if you do get random five times in a row

569
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,799
you may get three of the same number

570
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,200
um the seating is not great there are

571
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
some things you can do to it but

572
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,280
uh it's not worth it if you're trying to

573
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,520
do anything for a real password

574
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,200
don't don't use this but if you're using

575
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,799
something for a temporary password like

576
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,679
a lab

577
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,039
um this is great but get random is not

578
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,159
it's not a true uh it's not

579
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,280
not true random um and then this is just

580
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,080
blanking out

581
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,159
word one um so i'm

582
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,240
i don't need to fully get into all this

583
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,919
because i want to get into the fun

584
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:36,960
pickling

585
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,000
stuff but um

586
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,480
this is actually a cool problem that you

587
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,720
could solve and i'm i'm planning today

588
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,679
if i have

589
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,600
the time to finish it to put a blog post

590
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,520
on essentially how to start this

591
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,159
problem and give people a project to

592
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,600
kind of start because this

593
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,440
as you can see it's 13 lines um

594
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,480
it's a fairly easy thing to do and it's

595
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:00,960
a good

596
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,720
problem to tackle so

597
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,400
i'm gonna throw my my background

598
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,480
up here and then

599
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,760
shift for a moment um excuse me as i get

600
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,360
my

601
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,719
stations set up

602
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,559
and i say pickling what i really mean

603
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,720
is is fermenting here i'm going to show

604
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,880
you a basic ferment and then talk about

605
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,200
some

606
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,520
other things that we could ferment but

607
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,640
i'm going to show you

608
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,279
one of my favorite easy things to do i

609
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,960
keep saying the word easy

610
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,520
i don't mean that in a minimizing any

611
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,559
way i just need

612
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,159
i'm trying to show how this can be

613
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,679
something you can do on your own in your

614
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,520
time free time right now so

615
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,600
while i'm chopping and hopefully not

616
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,960
chopping my my fingers

617
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,159
okay all right

618
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,440
wow this feels like a real cooking

619
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,799
demonstration so um do not follow my

620
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,799
my cooking lead you really should if

621
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,000
you're chopping

622
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,559
you you should bear your knuckles like

623
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,200
that

624
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,320
i'm not great at it but um

625
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,240
so ginger bug is what i'm making here

626
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,760
i'm gonna start with two fingers of

627
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,679
ginger

628
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,360
that's a bit bigger of a finger um

629
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,080
but it works pickling in most cases is

630
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,840
not precise

631
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,840
um the only case is when you're adding

632
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,080
salt you should add two percent and this

633
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,760
recipe doesn't call for salt i'll talk

634
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,960
for a couple

635
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,039
in a couple minutes on things that do

636
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,960
require

637
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,120
salt um like actual pickles

638
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,039
and like i said i'm using the words

639
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,039
pickling and fermenting

640
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,840
interchangeably um a lot of people will

641
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,799
take this again

642
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,880
go ahead real quick okay if you're uh if

643
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,240
you're just on pickling and that's the

644
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,600
only slide you've got go ahead and kill

645
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:03,919
your

646
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,600
screen there so the webcam goes full

647
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,960
screen

648
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,320
ah perfect yep yeah

649
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,559
i have i have one in a second that i may

650
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,520
throw up with

651
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,240
proportions but um perfect awesome thank

652
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,799
you so much

653
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,440
that looks good is the lighting good

654
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,000
enough

655
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,039
yeah definitely thank you perfect thank

656
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,799
you okay

657
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,080
um so the skin on

658
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,960
that ginger a lot of people peel it um i

659
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,840
will only peel it if there's a blemish

660
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,120
um there isn't really on here but

661
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,720
what you're trying to do is get all the

662
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,640
bacteria you can um

663
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,320
now if this has been in my fridge for a

664
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,000
week i'm peeling the crap out of that

665
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,720
because there's

666
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,120
junk from all the stuff sitting in your

667
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,760
fridge

668
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,000
i'm i'm gonna peel it but this has been

669
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,679
sitting it hasn't been sitting in my

670
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,080
fridge

671
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,240
it's it's in a place where i crush the

672
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,320
macular bacteria

673
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,600
um so um

674
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,880
another thing if if i was downstairs

675
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,960
in a blender what i'd probably do is

676
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,679
chop this into chunks about like this

677
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,440
throw this into the blender and just let

678
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,279
it whiz instead

679
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,960
let's do this really

680
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,760
really rough you're you're just trying

681
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,200
to get the surface

682
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,159
um the surface area so that the bacteria

683
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,600
and water

684
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,080
and sugar can all interact and that the

685
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,399
bacteria can be coaxed out of here so i

686
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,360
said bacteria a few times um

687
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,279
especially in the world we're living in

688
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,520
right now where we're sanitizing our

689
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,200
hands every few seconds bacteria may

690
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,320
sound scary

691
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,440
um but there are good and bad

692
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,320
bacteria there's um in this case we're

693
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,240
trying to get beneficial

694
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,480
bacteria out of here but there are

695
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,080
obviously tons of

696
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,840
bacteria out there that are not good

697
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,440
there's e coli there's things like that

698
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,960
that you can think of

699
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,159
um and

700
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,159
they they work in very similar ways um i

701
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,679
i'm not even going to go into the health

702
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,279
benefits of all this although i believe

703
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,000
there are many

704
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,120
what i love about bacteria is that these

705
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,120
that there are millions of bacteria in a

706
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,559
maybe even trillions in just a

707
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,240
quarter inch by quarter inch cube like

708
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,080
that same quarter inch by quarter inch

709
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,840
but that is not a perfect cube

710
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,200
um so

711
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,399
they're in for example in a tablespoon

712
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,799
of sauerkraut you get a trillion

713
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,240
um cells a

714
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,600
cfu is actually colony-forming units of

715
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,159
bacteria and that's amazing to me

716
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,840
because there's living creatures in here

717
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,159
and

718
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,080
i have no control over what they do i

719
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,360
can coax them

720
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
i can move them towards what i want them

721
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,880
to do but

722
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,799
no two ferments are ever going to taste

723
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,440
the same because the bacteria

724
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,240
are going to respond and and actually

725
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,440
respond because they are living

726
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,399
creatures

727
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:03,439
to the conditions that you give them so

728
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,240
um if i had

729
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,480
you know patience i'd go a lot finer you

730
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,600
really don't need to

731
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,399
you're gonna strain this at the end so

732
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,600
i'm gonna go in the big jar

733
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,200
and there's gonna be a lot and this is

734
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,960
this is a quart sized mason jar

735
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,120
if you don't have mason jars i i'm not

736
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,960
encouraging anyone to go to the store to

737
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
get anything they don't have right now

738
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,520
if you cook a jar of tomato sauce use

739
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,799
that clean it out

740
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,039
um also i highly recommend that you

741
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,039
fully clean your hands because like i

742
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,960
was talking about bacteria

743
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,360
um if you have any nasty bacteria

744
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,200
bathroom bacteria or things

745
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,520
they're just going to expand and expand

746
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,120
in this ferments

747
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,760
um okay and as i say that i'm going to

748
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,000
i'm going to throw all this in here

749
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,600
um and then so that's two fingers of

750
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,000
ginger

751
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,760
and i'm gonna put a quarter cup of sugar

752
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,159
and the reason this jar is oversized is

753
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,279
because you're going to feed it every

754
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,000
day

755
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,960
um so quarter cup a little bit more a

756
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,159
little bit less is fine

757
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,159
this is not precise science

758
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,919
now i'm going to add i'm going to fill

759
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,440
this thing halfway full with water

760
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,879
i'm going to give it a shake

761
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,200
and i'm gonna put that in a cool

762
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,279
spot without sunlight

763
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,039
um and i'm gonna agitate this every few

764
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,600
days because you can't fully see it but

765
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,679
even within a few seconds sugar starts

766
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,200
settling to the bottom

767
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,559
um now every day you want to add

768
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,399
another a quarter cup of sugar

769
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,600
and and a finger of garlic

770
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,360
garlic wow you could add garlic that

771
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,640
would be a very different thing and i

772
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,760
want to talk about that in a minute

773
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,120
because you can really

774
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,760
ferment anything you want here in a lot

775
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,039
of these same mechanisms

776
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,360
um but back to the actual ferment

777
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,240
you you want to take every day for seven

778
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,760
days you want to take a finger

779
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,360
of ginger and you want to take a quarter

780
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,720
cup of sugar you want to add it and give

781
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,760
it a little shake

782
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,840
and put it back in its cool place to

783
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,039
rest um if you see

784
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,440
foaming at the top that is great that

785
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,720
means that the

786
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,799
bacteria is eating the sugar and turning

787
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,120
it into more bacteria and then into a

788
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,399
small amount of alcohol

789
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,240
this is going to end up at about one

790
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,760
percent alcohol if you follow those

791
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,039
proportions

792
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,120
um i'm not teaching you how to make um

793
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,919
how to make bathtub hootier but the

794
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,840
reality is most bacteria

795
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,559
put off some amount of alpha um

796
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,039
so how much time do i have

797
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,320
uh you have 10 minutes perfect just okay

798
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:04,960
class so

799
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,120
right up right about 10 minutes okay

800
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,000
just

801
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,760
question uh from somebody about the uh

802
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,120
will you be sharing the recipes and

803
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,480
everything on

804
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,279
twitter yes i will um i'll put up a

805
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,159
slide at the

806
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,360
the end with my uh website and um

807
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,880
some high level um yeah some high level

808
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,760
recipes

809
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,640
my i had more slides in all honesty but

810
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,760
my computer

811
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,080
i decided not to save them apparently my

812
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,519
computer decided to update

813
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,440
and um here i am oh

814
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,039
demo you're good thanks so um

815
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,000
yeah so so this you you could honestly

816
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,600
do a lot of things with this i've done

817
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,360
turmeric in the same exact way i've

818
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:45,919
actually

819
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,440
i joked about it earlier but i've heard

820
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,279
of people doing garlic in the same way

821
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,039
this is a beverage i would not recommend

822
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,559
you doing that um

823
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,559
it may be good for some sort of wacky

824
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,640
cleanse that you may want to do

825
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,039
um someone may tell you it cures the

826
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,880
coronavirus it probably doesn't

827
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,000
but the but this this is going to be a

828
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,279
beverage at the end of it what you're

829
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:05,919
going to do

830
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,919
is you're going to take this and you're

831
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,000
going to um

832
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,519
it if you have the uh flip tube darts

833
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,640
you can strain this and fill and

834
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,240
funnel it into one of those flip top

835
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,480
jars and let it go for another week

836
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,360
add add a pinch of sugar add maybe a

837
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,960
half tablespoon of sugar

838
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,799
so that it has a little more to ferment

839
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,799
um and get effervescent

840
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,640
but if you don't you just pour this into

841
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,159
another mason jar with the lid

842
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,799
honestly i have these plastic lids here

843
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,000
i don't recommend them

844
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,919
they don't have a seal you can't see it

845
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,679
but i've sprayed my arms already dust

846
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,640
and shaking

847
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,080
so um metal lids are the

848
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,960
are gonna feel the most the the tightest

849
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,679
there

850
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,000
so i hear some background noise

851
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,120
there um but

852
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,480
now okay so another major ferment

853
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,399
um you can do this with just about any

854
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,679
vegetable or fruit

855
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,360
is um an actual pickle

856
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,120
which the proportions on that are two

857
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,480
percent salt by weight

858
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,879
now in most cases if you don't actually

859
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,000
have a scale

860
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,719
um add somewhere between a tablespoon

861
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,280
and a half and two tablespoons of

862
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,879
of salt in a um in a quart mason jar

863
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,800
this size

864
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
and that's going to end up being close

865
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,320
enough if you go too

866
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,719
little or too much you're you're

867
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,918
fermenting

868
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,079
some mold on it um and in reality if you

869
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,000
open this up at the end

870
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,639
and you see a thin layer of of white

871
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,359
mold

872
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,560
it's actually fine it's not

873
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,000
you know it's gonna it's one of the

874
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,239
byproducts of fermentation

875
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,960
and you will be fine if it is a string

876
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,520
the the

877
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,560
more exotic of the color do not touch it

878
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,918
if it smells funny

879
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,480
do not drink it do not do not ever touch

880
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,359
a ferment

881
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,520
that has that that smells funny that is

882
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,520
the biggest thing trust your nose

883
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,960
um and funny is obviously subjective if

884
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,800
you think hey that may be funny maybe go

885
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,680
to an expert or someone who

886
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,320
um knows a little more but so that two

887
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,800
percent

888
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,560
salt and you can do so many things with

889
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,400
that if you top up a head of cabbage

890
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,119
you add two percent um by weight salt to

891
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:19,599
it

892
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,599
and you toss that you have sauerkraut

893
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,599
and then you put a weight on it

894
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,320
and you let that go for a few weeks you

895
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,839
have sauerkraut you can do the same with

896
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,119
pickles you can

897
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,599
but you you know um you could you could

898
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,280
pickle so many things you can pickle

899
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,240
ginger

900
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,920
onions you can um

901
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,079
honestly i've picked i've in that same

902
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,119
exact method

903
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,240
i've pickled um oranges

904
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,400
and it sounds weird as hell but it's

905
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,839
just in this time

906
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,280
where you're eating the same thing day

907
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,079
in day out adding a new taste that you

908
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,839
haven't tasted before it's kind of fun

909
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,599
and i i'm enjoying it my kids are

910
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,599
enjoying enjoying it

911
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,880
um if you have

912
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,520
um apple cider vinegar i i like on a lot

913
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,040
of my ferments to pour

914
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,760
not not in a beverage like this but in a

915
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,520
pickle i would pour just a little bit of

916
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,960
apple cider vinegar on the top not

917
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,000
agitated

918
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,839
and then that kind of perform forms a

919
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,760
protective layer that's especially if

920
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,119
you haven't done a lot of fermenting in

921
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,160
your house you don't know what the

922
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,480
bacteria is going to be like

923
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,240
that kind of just gives that barrier the

924
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,160
other thing is

925
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,680
preserved fruit right now we have um i

926
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,160
have 26 fruit trees on the property here

927
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,320
um on a quarter acre actually uh

928
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,359
neighbors love it

929
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,800
uh no they don't um neighbor kids love

930
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,520
it because they

931
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,359
they get fruit and all that but so we

932
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,040
have kumquats um

933
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,240
and you salt pack those literally

934
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,119
kumquats in salt and it's it there's an

935
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,400
egyptian word for it

936
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
they do it with uh key lime but it's

937
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,520
just delicious

938
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,280
it's it's a way that you've never had um

939
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,119
citrus before and it's great on a salad

940
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,880
meat dish for that kind of brightness

941
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,240
so um okay

942
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,599
that is pretty much my time were there

943
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,119
other questions

944
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,760
aside from slides and things that i will

945
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,560
post

946
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,040
yeah totally um so i'm gonna i'm gonna

947
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,720
rattle these off here just without you

948
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,160
answering because uh just

949
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,839
in the interest of time um and i

950
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,000
apologize i'll miss uh miss a couple of

951
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,240
uh

952
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,800
questions here for folks but one of the

953
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,880
questions is do you recommend making

954
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,680
or using screw top jars for all pickling

955
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
or is there a time and a place for a

956
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,480
mason jar

957
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,079
there are others folks asking can you

958
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,720
combine ingredients ginger and lemon

959
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,400
lots of folks asking for recipes i

960
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,839
pointed them said you'd you know

961
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,560
certainly post the website um but also

962
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,920
follow homebrewsec

963
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,240
on twitter and i have no doubt you'll be

964
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,000
tweeting out the link to that website uh

965
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,680
after we're down

966
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,800
and uh hold me honest to that um

967
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,240
or pop that up there uh and uh

968
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,680
what's the form of pickling you do the

969
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,480
most lots of folks asking for recipes

970
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,400
and some folks asking for powershell

971
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,079
resources right so

972
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,839
it looks like your slides and resources

973
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,680
going up at homebrewsuck.com and this

974
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,160
has been

975
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,200
outstanding thank you so much

976
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,400
that was great and there were some

977
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,000
people want to answer some of those

978
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
questions in broad or should i just take

979
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,880
that offline

980
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,599
yeah i would take that offline for sure

981
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,040
because we're getting ready to roll

982
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,440
but i think there's just too many yeah

983
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,640
the big thing is there was one

984
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,240
person that mentioned twitter and they

985
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,480
say they don't have twitter that's fine

986
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,079
um if you don't have twitter that's not

987
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,920
that big of a deal uh you can still

988
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,359
access his twitter feed

989
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,400
uh just from a browser and i'm gonna try

990
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,839
and cross post a lot of it

991
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,760
this stuff in blog form it's it's been

992
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,880
clear to me that

993
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,400
more hackers than i thought are

994
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,720
interested in um pickling which

995
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,560
to me is just hacking vegetables and

996
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,880
hacking fruit um it's getting it to do

997
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,160
something that you've never gotten it to

998
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,200
do before

999
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,240
um so i it makes me realize that i

1000
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,280
should

1001
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,400
go a lot more of the pickling fermenting

1002
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,720
route on my blog and on my uh

1003
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,480
on my twitter so i will definitely do

1004
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,040
that since apparently people are

1005
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,040
interested
