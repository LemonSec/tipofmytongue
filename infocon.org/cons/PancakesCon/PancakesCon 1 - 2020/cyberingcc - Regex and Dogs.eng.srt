1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
in cc regular expressions are a powerful

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,440
tool that is available that is valuable

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,120
i'm sorry for everyone

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,400
programmer or not to learn regex is a

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,160
language for describing search patterns

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,880
of text

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,559
this can help you quickly achieve

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,160
complex tasks that would otherwise

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,119
be tedious or time consuming we'll cover

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,359
the basic rules and syntax get everyone

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,800
started then introduce some more

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,080
advanced topics and

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,920
end with some powerful examples and then

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,000
positive reinforcement dog training is a

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,760
method for training where you tell your

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,320
dog

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,480
what you wanted to do by rewarding it

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,079
for good behavior

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,920
it is extremely effective for capturing

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,680
and shaping desired behaviors

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,360
we'll cover research in this field and

22
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,680
basic methods for working with a clicker

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,879
and treats this one with a probably

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,239
pre-recorded but

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,399
honestly folks i'm hoping that he tries

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,280
it live

27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,520
demo of my dog's trip rep trick

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,280
repertoire

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,480
so without any further ado cyber and cc

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,480
over to you cool i have good news

31
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,239
i did not get to edit a pre-recorded

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,840
video so it will be

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,000
a live demo and it will probably be a

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,439
total disaster

35
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,000
um so we'll give that a shot toward the

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,520
end and right now

37
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,680
let's talk about regular expressions so

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,600
i will go ahead and present here

39
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,520
and hope let's see can we do full screen

40
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,040
oh well close enough um so

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,040
this is regex and dogs and who am i

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,159
i am a security researcher i've been

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,560
doing this stuff for about seven years i

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,240
am kind of like an obsessive programmer

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
and i like solving security

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,360
problems with code or problems in the

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,600
security space i do a lot of reverse

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,960
engineering i do a lot of program

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,640
analysis and recently i've been doing a

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,640
lot of binary instrumentation which is

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,200
like

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,960
reverse engineering with code so you're

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,399
kind of looking at

54
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,840
applications as they run i also make

55
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,240
some

56
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,159
youtube videos i am putting together

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,000
very slowly a free security course on

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,719
youtube

59
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,280
uh you can get that uh the course index

60
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
at cybrine.cc i'm not trying to sell you

61
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
anything it's just a very

62
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,040
uh blank page that links to all my

63
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,720
videos and you can follow me on twitter

64
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,318
at cyberncc

65
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,440
like the url with no period so let's

66
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,760
talk about regex

67
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,640
uh can i do what's the full screen

68
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,120
command

69
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,400
f11 yeah there we go um

70
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,120
so why reject so regex is the one thing

71
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,080
that i would teach

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,120
to everyone if i could uh it is

73
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,599
super powerful it's basically like find

74
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,480
and replace

75
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,920
uh on steroids um so it is a language

76
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,000
for matching text and then there is also

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,160
some features for replacing text which i

78
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,000
will very briefly mention at the end

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,280
but even if you're never going to

80
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,640
program or you're never going to get

81
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,080
into infosec like

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,680
if your boss gives you a spreadsheet and

83
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
it's like find a bunch of like

84
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,879
first names and last names in here and

85
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,400
swap the last name and first name

86
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,560
in this like comma separated list very

87
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,560
easy to do with regex kind of a pain to

88
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,519
do manually

89
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,360
it could take hours or days to do that

90
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,440
on a large list can take an instant with

91
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,400
regex

92
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,120
so it is also something i really use

93
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,760
every day

94
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,879
uh like yeah just cleaning up code

95
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,640
replacing tabs with spaces or spaces

96
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,319
with tabs depending on the files

97
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,280
uh yeah manipulating stuff on the

98
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,400
command line it's just

99
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,040
something that is so common so i'm very

100
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,760
happy to be

101
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
showing it to you for the infosec

102
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,080
community uh it is also used in yara

103
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,120
which is like a

104
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,760
malware detection rule format uh it's

105
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,000
used in snort which is an ids so network

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,440
detection rule format

107
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,560
um it's i'm sure available in every sort

108
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,879
of log review thing you have

109
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,080
i've never really worked with those

110
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,000
though so i can't say for certain

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
it's in all your text editors and ides i

112
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,599
use it a lot in programming if i need to

113
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,080
like swap data around or

114
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,319
kind of do like change multiple lines at

115
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,920
once or replace a variable name with a

116
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,080
variable name i like more

117
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,000
so yeah it's it's there it's on your

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,200
command line with

119
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,080
utilities like grep or said and it's in

120
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,760
word processors kinda i think like

121
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,920
microsoft word has like a pseudo-regex

122
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,120
thing going on in there

123
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,879
um and it's also in a lot of programming

124
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,360
languages so here it is in sublime text

125
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,159
you

126
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,040
uh enable it with your little dot star

127
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,560
here here it is in vs code you can

128
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
enable it by clicking the dot star here

129
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,320
here's an excerpt from the grep

130
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,238
manual page where you can use the

131
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,440
capital p

132
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,479
command line switch or flag to

133
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,800
give it a regular expression to match

134
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,479
here it is in javascript here it is in

135
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,360
python

136
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
uh it is everywhere so very

137
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,960
very useful thing very universal thing

138
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,680
so

139
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,440
it's very much like ctrl f so you can

140
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,000
you use ctrl f you just find things you

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,040
type in your

142
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,639
strings and it'll match it so if we

143
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,639
typed in dogs here it's going to match

144
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,919
the string dogs

145
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,199
but it has a lot of special characters

146
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,360
and operators to make it more useful so

147
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
for example there's an ore operator

148
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,919
so in this case we're matching dogs with

149
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,840
a pipe character and then cats and that

150
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,800
indicates

151
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,039
an ore so that's going to match anything

152
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,280
that has dogs or cats

153
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,360
and that pipe character if you are not

154
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,199
super familiar with

155
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,880
it because it is kind of a rare one it

156
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,639
is like the shift backslash

157
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,880
so shift above the enter key and that's

158
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,400
going to allow you to match multiple

159
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,520
things

160
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,160
uh so in this case yeah we did dogs or

161
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,800
cats

162
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,000
and then if we move on from there there

163
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,400
is

164
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,440
a uh dot character so this is

165
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,639
really the any character match so that's

166
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,360
gonna

167
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,240
match any character twice so there's two

168
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,639
of them

169
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,240
and then it's going to be followed by s

170
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,320
and then t so in this case there's two

171
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,919
s and t's in there and then we're going

172
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,600
to match the two characters before those

173
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
two so we'll get b

174
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,479
e s t and x i s t it is denoted by

175
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,600
a period uh and yeah that's it's pretty

176
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,199
straightforward but that that's kind of

177
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,600
a

178
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,639
wild card so then since we don't

179
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,560
necessarily want like we wanted to match

180
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,440
like a seven

181
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,039
any characters we wouldn't really want

182
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,440
to type like dot dot dot dot dot

183
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,039
so in that case we have length modifiers

184
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,840
so this first one is a star and that

185
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,639
means match

186
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,680
zero or more and we saw a couple slides

187
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,280
ago the dot star is kind of the

188
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,120
universal symbol for regex because it

189
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,160
just means match

190
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,560
anything so we're matching the inner any

191
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,319
character and then our length modifier

192
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:22,880
is saying

193
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,039
we're matching zero or more any

194
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,000
characters

195
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,080
so that's just going to give us uh

196
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,199
basically everything

197
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,720
in in our selection uh in

198
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
a lot of text editors it does it by line

199
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,919
so

200
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,240
in this case you would basically find

201
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,319
every line for you

202
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,360
so what we can do then is use that as a

203
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,680
prefix so if we did like dot star dogs

204
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,319
it would match

205
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,680
zero more characters and then the

206
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,400
strings dogs so we match our first line

207
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,120
with zero characters before it with dogs

208
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,160
and then we also match our last line

209
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,960
with everything before it with dogs in

210
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,599
it so

211
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,280
if you're trying to select everything up

212
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,840
to like a certain delimiter like a comma

213
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,280
or something like that or a

214
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,680
tab uh you could do dot star comma dot

215
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,120
star tab and that's going to select

216
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,520
everything for you up into that point

217
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,360
well up into and including your

218
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,919
your kind of terminating character there

219
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,479
so

220
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
what if you don't want zero and you

221
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,840
actually want one or more uh you can use

222
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,280
the plus and that's going to be a length

223
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,120
modifier that

224
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,199
gives you one or more so in this case it

225
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,880
doesn't match the first dogs because

226
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,960
there are no characters before that

227
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,919
but it will match those ones the have i

228
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,840
mentioned dogs because half i mentioned

229
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,240
is more than one character um so yeah

230
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,840
that that basically sets a lower bound

231
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,520
for you

232
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,639
oh that that didn't scale to uh this

233
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,199
this full screen mode but this uh length

234
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,039
modifier you can give it brackets

235
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,000
and then uh a lower bound and upper

236
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,479
bound

237
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,319
and they're inclusive so if we said ex

238
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,440
uh or be and then followed by

239
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,240
any character repeated two to three

240
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,879
times

241
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,639
so that's a range so it's gonna go from

242
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,319
two if you give it two to ten it's gonna

243
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:04,720
go

244
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,120
two three four five six seven eight nine

245
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,639
or ten characters

246
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,800
so in this case it's going to match ex

247
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,639
or be followed by

248
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,639
st for the two characters till it hits

249
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,680
the end of the line or

250
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,280
ist for the uh three characters

251
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
so that's that's the range uh that's

252
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
useful when you aren't just trying to

253
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,120
get as much as you can and instead

254
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,879
have a very specific size and we will

255
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,400
see an example of that

256
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,958
in a little bit so the first application

257
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,159
we have

258
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,200
is going to be finding urls so

259
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,320
very simply like i use this i shouldn't

260
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,519
say it but i use this when

261
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,120
like web scraping generally when you're

262
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,360
web scraping you should be using an html

263
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,880
parser and actually pulling things out

264
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,600
correctly

265
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,959
but a lot of times you want to do things

266
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,959
quick and dirty so if you want to

267
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,200
recover the urls out of a file really

268
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,959
quick you can write a regex to pull them

269
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:55,360
out

270
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,800
so in this case we have four urls

271
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
and their ip addresses and say we don't

272
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,640
want the ip addresses we just want to

273
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,760
find the urls

274
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,959
we can do an https colon slash dot star

275
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,160
and that's going to match the rest of

276
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,519
the url

277
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,760
and that will of course ignore all the

278
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,000
ip addresses because they do not start

279
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,480
with it

280
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,279
with https uh what i usually do with

281
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:17,680
this

282
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,040
is like do a find all and that will

283
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,720
highlight them all and then you can just

284
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,120
copy them out open a new file and paste

285
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,080
them all in

286
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,920
and that kind of can extract stuff out

287
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,240
of out of a file for you

288
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,320
so uh yeah the next thing

289
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,600
is uh special characters so we have our

290
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,120
dot character and that matches any

291
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,640
character but what if we

292
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,000
actually want to match a period so if we

293
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,760
did four dot and for any character

294
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,800
that's going to match

295
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,640
for these four dots in here but it's

296
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,080
also going to match like four four or

297
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,399
four

298
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,959
two or four zero because it is the any

299
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,680
character

300
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,920
so the spoiler is that you use a

301
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,720
backslash

302
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,920
so there are there's a concept of escape

303
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,800
characters

304
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,640
and so to escape a character you can use

305
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,880
a backslash and there are a bunch of

306
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,839
these

307
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,040
so this is not a complete list but like

308
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,560
backslash dot will match an

309
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,880
actual period backslash backslash if you

310
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,440
want to match an actual backslash

311
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,120
then you have your new line and tab

312
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,560
characters which

313
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,760
if you program they come up quite a bit

314
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,200
for formatting strings and stuff like

315
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,959
that but then regex also

316
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,720
has its own kind of character classes or

317
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,000
special character classes as a

318
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,279
convenience for you so

319
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,880
for example you have word characters

320
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,360
which are like the lowercase

321
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,120
letters the uppercase letters the

322
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,200
numbers and underscores

323
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,279
is it the numbers i should double check

324
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,720
that but um

325
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,040
so that's like if you had yeah if you

326
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,399
wanted to match kind of

327
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,720
yeah chunks of words it's gonna you can

328
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,240
just use a backslash w

329
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,360
you can also capitalize these to match

330
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,399
the opposite of that

331
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,160
so if you wanted everything that wasn't

332
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,680
word characters you could do a

333
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,920
backslash capital w same things for

334
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
space characters which match tab spaces

335
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,279
and new lines

336
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,040
you could do a backslash capital s to

337
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,120
get everything that isn't spaces

338
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,560
um and then there's digits and

339
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,480
anti-digits and stuff and there's a

340
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,240
bunch more that you can look up

341
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,640
but that's that's the idea of escaping

342
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,160
so if you're ever running into a truck

343
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,360
problem where you're trying to match

344
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
something but uh it

345
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,680
is treating it as a special character

346
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,720
you can look up the escapes for it

347
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,440
so and here is another example so this

348
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,200
is one that gets used a lot this isn't a

349
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,760
great

350
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,519
ip address matching uh regex

351
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,640
but we can use it for this example

352
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,560
uh like it's it's one of those things

353
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,800
where if i was trying to find

354
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,200
regex or trying to pull out ips from a

355
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,079
file

356
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,440
this is something that i could write and

357
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
as long as it works it works and then if

358
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,640
i needed something to actually like

359
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,399
validate ip addresses

360
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,240
i'd go to stack overflow and find the

361
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,720
the most advanced regex for that but

362
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
to break this down it is a digit so

363
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,600
backslash d repeated one to three times

364
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,959
so that is like our first octet

365
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,440
of the ip address followed by an escaped

366
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,160
period

367
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,200
and then that's just going to be

368
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,560
repeated three times so we could

369
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,600
actually make this a lot

370
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,480
smaller with repetition and parenthesis

371
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,399
putting parentheses around this but

372
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,680
for the most part it's just we're

373
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,519
matching one to three digits period one

374
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,720
to three digits period one to three

375
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,639
digits period one to three digits so

376
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,320
that is a super useful thing for that

377
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,639
so now there are character classes so we

378
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,639
have our kind of built-in

379
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,680
uh backslash w backslash s for character

380
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,959
classes but what if we wanted to do a

381
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:33,839
custom one

382
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,760
so what if we wanted to match lowercase

383
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,720
letters uh only so you can just define a

384
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,079
range in brackets

385
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,000
you can also just list characters out so

386
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,920
if you only wanted to match a b c d you

387
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,360
could do brackets a b c d

388
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,279
and that would match those or you can

389
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,040
give ranges which is generally what i

390
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,240
end up doing so we have brackets

391
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,160
a through z and that's going to be all

392
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,920
the lowercase letters followed by an

393
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,480
escaped

394
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,519
period followed by com or cc and that is

395
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,680
going to match all our urls excluding

396
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,160
the

397
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,320
https here is another application this

398
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,959
is one i

399
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,040
really like so if you're taking maybe

400
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,560
the sha-256

401
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,120
on or using shot 256 sum on the command

402
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,519
line and getting shot 256's

403
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,040
you can the output won't necessarily be

404
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,800
so clean i think that utility returns

405
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,680
the file name

406
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,600
followed by the shot 256 and usually i

407
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,040
do not care about the file name so you

408
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,480
can pipe this to grep

409
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,399
with the regular expression to match hex

410
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,160
digits so 0 through 9

411
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,000
lowercase a through f capital a through

412
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,079
f repeated for 64

413
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,000
characters and that's going to match our

414
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,839
regular or our

415
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,199
shot 256 hashes here

416
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,199
oh here's an example so if we did a shot

417
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,040
256 of all the malware

418
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,839
dot exes in our malware folder and then

419
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,440
we can pipe that to grep and say

420
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,560
the dash o is we only want what we match

421
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,880
and that capital p is to say this is a

422
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,000
pcre

423
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
so pearl compatible regular expression

424
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,839
and we pass it our regex for

425
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,440
uh hex characters

426
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,959
of 64 length uh then that will go ahead

427
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,360
and find these uh these

428
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,560
hashes uh the capital a through f are

429
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,079
clearly not necessary here because it's

430
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,680
lowercase but sometimes i forget and

431
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,560
sometimes

432
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,399
the hashes are in different formats and

433
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,000
are capitalized not from the same

434
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,199
utility but

435
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,720
that's just i always throw it in there

436
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,440
as a safety

437
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,399
so there is also much much much much

438
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,120
more

439
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,000
um this is there's there's things you

440
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,839
can do so you can do an optional match

441
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,079
and that's a question mark so if we

442
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,160
wanted to match http colon slash slash

443
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,000
or https colon slash

444
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,399
we wouldn't net uh we wouldn't

445
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,600
necessarily need

446
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,160
to use the or we can just say the s is

447
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,320
optional in that case so we have http

448
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,560
and optional s and then colon slash

449
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,000
flash and that will

450
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,120
uh match http or https um

451
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,959
the question mark is a little confusing

452
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,199
because it can also be used after a

453
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,959
length modifier to be

454
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,920
stingy so by their nature regular

455
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,800
expressions are

456
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,279
greedy uh they will try to match as much

457
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,320
as they can

458
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,199
so if you had like tab character dot

459
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:13,600
star

460
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,839
tab and you were just trying to get

461
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:16,800
something between

462
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,279
two tabs and there were multiple tabs on

463
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,720
the line it would find the

464
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,560
two tabs that are furthest away from

465
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,959
each other um but if you add a question

466
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,360
mark on the length modifier the star

467
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,680
uh it will actually try to match as few

468
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,480
as possible

469
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,959
so that'll find a tab as few characters

470
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:33,600
as it can

471
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,279
and then another tab so that's that's a

472
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,639
very useful thing

473
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,279
you can also anchor your matches to the

474
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,199
beginning of the line or the end of the

475
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,880
line so the

476
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,199
carrot is beginning the line so if you

477
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,519
wanted to only find urls

478
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,440
that were at the start of the line you

479
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,639
could do a

480
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,519
carrot and then https colon slash and

481
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,560
that would only

482
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,320
match things at the beginning you can

483
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,759
use the same thing for end of the line

484
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,519
with a dollar sign so if you only wanted

485
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,560
to find

486
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,519
uh punctuation that was before the end

487
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,880
of the line you could

488
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,399
have make a character class or

489
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,639
punctuation throw a dollar sign on the

490
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,199
end

491
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,759
and try to and yeah that would match

492
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,480
everything

493
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,440
at the end of the line you can also and

494
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,199
the carrot's another ambiguous one not

495
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,399
ambiguous but

496
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,240
multiple uses so if you have a character

497
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,880
class so the square brackets

498
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,440
and you can negate it using the carrot

499
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,959
so if i had a

500
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,199
square brackets carrot comma square

501
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,480
bracket

502
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,720
one or more match that's going to match

503
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,639
anything that is not a comma

504
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,399
so that's another useful thing so if

505
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,040
you're matching say urls in html you

506
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,920
could do

507
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,320
i want to match https and then i want to

508
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,639
match everything that's not a quote or

509
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,399
like i want to match href

510
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,320
equals quote and then everything that's

511
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,000
not a quote up to the next

512
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,920
quote and that's going to be a good way

513
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
to kind of pull out the stuff between

514
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,199
two delimiters so then you have look

515
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,519
aheads and look behinds which i will not

516
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,639
cover in this but those are basically

517
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,520
zero length matches that assert that

518
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,400
something is

519
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,280
in front or behind of a match or not in

520
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:09,919
front

521
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,439
and not behind a match so there's also

522
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,039
negative look at heads and negative look

523
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,880
behind so that would be like

524
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,520
if you wanted if you wanted https called

525
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,240
slash

526
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,720
in front of the url but you did not want

527
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,000
the to actually capture the https in

528
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,720
your match

529
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,039
you could use a positive look behind to

530
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,600
say there is an https here

531
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,039
or a positive look ahead to say there's

532
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,640
an https here and then

533
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,039
what we want to match and then the last

534
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,640
thing is you can use variables in

535
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,000
replacements so

536
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,919
every time you use parentheses unless

537
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,760
you specifically mark it to be a

538
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,520
non-capturing group

539
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,160
it will capture it and kind of save it

540
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,000
as a variable so then when you go

541
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
to replace things you can use those

542
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,320
variables which would be like backslash

543
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,760
one or dollar sign one depending on the

544
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,679
syntax that you're using or the program

545
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,960
that you're using

546
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,799
but you could say like if you captured

547
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,559
http or https in the first

548
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,080
first parentheses and then you went to

549
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,000
use the replace you could use backslash

550
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,480
one to put that in the replacement

551
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,520
so i hope that made sense without uh the

552
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,480
slide or a visual but it's possible and

553
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,080
when you need it you can look it up

554
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,200
and the answers are all there

555
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,400
so that moves us on to dogs

556
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,200
so i have well i had two dogs one passed

557
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,120
away a couple weeks ago and he was a

558
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,799
super good dog so this talk goes out to

559
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,240
raelyn

560
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,520
but the the idea was when

561
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,760
i got him and i knew nothing about dog

562
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,360
training and then my girlfriend

563
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,880
learned a ton about dog training and

564
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,480
taught me good dog training

565
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,200
um and so he really grew up using

566
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,360
positive reinforcement training and now

567
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,799
uh my dog ava uh she she is

568
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,480
who is getting all the attention

569
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,240
currently and she is who's being trained

570
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,880
so

571
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,480
what what is positive reinforcement

572
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,360
training it is um

573
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,840
it's rewarding your dogs for behavior

574
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,480
you want

575
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,919
i guess this is the overview so i won't

576
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,360
get into that yet but we're going to

577
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,200
cover positive reinforcement training

578
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,520
using a clicker and then a dog body

579
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,720
language i will

580
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,080
drive home that your dog probably needs

581
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,840
exercise and then we will get

582
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,600
a demo and that will be a lot of fun

583
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,960
so um basically the idea is through

584
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,320
training you're communicating with your

585
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,039
dog

586
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,440
um and a lot of people operate kind of

587
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,520
by telling their dogs what they want

588
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
what they don't want them to do so like

589
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,280
no don't do that don't get in the trash

590
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,679
no don't don't chew that up no don't do

591
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,320
this

592
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,240
and that's really kind of hard for your

593
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,600
dog to understand a negative

594
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,919
and we'll see why but like the science

595
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,760
is that telling your dog

596
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,559
what you want them to be doing is much

597
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,160
easier for them to understand and you

598
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,919
can kind of capture

599
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,679
what they should be doing and reward

600
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,200
them for that and that makes the

601
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,640
connection in their brain

602
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,559
uh very well so this can be from

603
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,000
everything from potty training to tricks

604
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,440
so for potty training you're giving your

605
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,799
dogs treats when they're using the

606
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,159
restroom outside and they're like hey

607
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,280
this is where i should be using the

608
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,600
restroom this is awesome

609
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,880
and then from tricks it's giving your

610
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,280
dog

611
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
rewards for doing a behavior or you're

612
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,039
capturing a behavior and we'll get get

613
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,039
more into that

614
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,840
so the the kind of psychological science

615
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
behind this

616
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,080
um i want to cover this because it's in

617
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,000
the psychology community positive and

618
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,480
negative mean different things

619
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,120
and in terms of operant conditioning

620
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,320
which is what this is

621
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,880
called positive means giving something

622
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,640
and negative means taking something away

623
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,159
it does not necessarily mean

624
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,880
good reinforcement or bad reinforcement

625
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,559
so classical conditioning

626
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,280
is like pavlov's pavlov stocks it's in

627
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,600
so

628
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,840
it's associating an involuntary response

629
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,000
to a stimulus so in that case

630
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,080
it was they're giving the dogs a treat

631
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,280
and ringing a bell

632
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,360
and then the classical conditioning is

633
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,799
when they ring the bell the dog starts

634
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,080
salivating

635
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,280
which is uh involuntary response and

636
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,600
it's been associated with

637
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,960
a stimulus which was the bell so operant

638
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,440
conditioning is associating a voluntary

639
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,640
behavior uh with a consequence and that

640
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,760
consequence

641
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
with positive reinforcement is giving

642
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,120
them a reward

643
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
so the consequences positive means

644
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,880
giving something and negative means

645
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,080
taking something away

646
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,720
and reinforcement encourages a behavior

647
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,120
and punishment discourages your behavior

648
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,760
so we see that in a chart positive

649
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,000
reinforcement is adding a good stimulus

650
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,080
to encourage a behavior or adding a

651
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,679
stimulus to encouraging behavior but

652
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,120
that is generally a good

653
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,159
thing because it's a reward for positive

654
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,360
punishment

655
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,720
it means giving a punishment

656
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,559
and so and punishment is discouraging

657
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,400
and bad behavior so positive punishment

658
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,720
is

659
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,240
adding a negative stimulus uh sorry i

660
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,919
should say adding a bad to not confuse

661
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,760
the terms but adding a bad stimulus to

662
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,120
discourage behavior and i'll have

663
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,280
examples of these on the next slide

664
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,080
negative reinforcement is removing a bad

665
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,919
stimulus to encourage your behavior so

666
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,520
you're encouraging the behavior through

667
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,480
reinforcement

668
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,039
but you're removing something bad in

669
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,240
order to encourage it

670
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,440
and negative punishment which sounds the

671
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,000
worst but

672
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,120
is that it's actually up there with

673
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
positive reinforcement it's removing a

674
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,840
good stimulus to discourage a behavior

675
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,559
so what are some examples of this so

676
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,240
positive reinforcement giving your dog a

677
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,280
treat when they sit

678
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,120
that's gonna associate sitting with a

679
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,320
good thing and

680
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,559
they will continue to do it a positive

681
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,919
punishment is giving

682
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,039
your dog a shock uh when it barks

683
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,159
and so that's that's yeah that's

684
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,400
giving something but the thing is

685
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,320
discouraging their behavior

686
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,360
um a negative reinforcement so

687
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,320
negative reinforcement is like taking

688
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,159
away a negative stimulus or a bad

689
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,039
stimulus

690
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,559
when they do what you want so it would

691
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,559
be like continuing to yell at your dog

692
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,679
until they went into their crate so it's

693
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,159
it's like they're they have a negative

694
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,720
stimulus or a bad stimulus and it stops

695
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
when they do the thing

696
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,159
um and then negative punishment is

697
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,400
like if your dog was greeting someone

698
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,840
and you didn't want them to jump when

699
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,640
they greeted

700
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,400
uh they your dog jumps on the person

701
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,240
they're greeting uh and that person just

702
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,360
turns around and walks their

703
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,720
walks away they turn their back on them

704
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,120
so the dog the dog

705
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,919
doesn't get the enjoyment of meeting

706
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,840
someone new they don't get the

707
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,320
reward of being petted there um it's

708
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,200
just

709
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,440
like the excitement of seeing someone

710
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,559
new stops

711
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,919
when they misbehave so that is actually

712
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,360
a very common tool so when our dog was a

713
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:37,919
puppy

714
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,080
he would bite our legs if he bought if

715
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,600
he bit our legs we would turn around and

716
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,840
walk away or he'd bite our clothing

717
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,960
when he did that we'd turn around and

718
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,039
walk away and that would train him like

719
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:47,520
oh

720
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,279
i was super excited so i was biting them

721
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,120
but when i did bite them they

722
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,960
they walked away so i should stop doing

723
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,320
that so i get to see them because

724
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,919
they're what i'm excited about so

725
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,080
most of this will focus on positive

726
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,279
reinforcement because that

727
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,400
is what is used the most um so

728
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,000
it's basically rewarding your dog with

729
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,240
something it loves so this could be food

730
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,159
it could be praise it could be attention

731
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,120
it could be play

732
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,600
it could be toys you see a lot of trick

733
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,320
dogs

734
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,880
when they after they finish like an

735
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,520
agility routine after they finish the

736
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,799
like fly ball run they are rewarded with

737
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,320
a toy um disc dogs same like if they're

738
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,360
going after frisbees um after they do

739
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,799
that really well they'll get to play

740
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,320
with a toy

741
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,400
so it's basically rewarding your dog for

742
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,320
the behaviors that you want

743
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,640
and some dogs are not motivated by food

744
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
they're not motivated by

745
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,320
much of anything and hopefully if

746
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,679
they're not motivated by anything

747
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,039
they're not getting into much trouble

748
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,880
either but most dogs are going to care

749
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,240
about food or they're going to

750
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,520
care about a toy or they're going to

751
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,760
care about your praise so

752
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,600
once again it's just communicating how

753
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,120
you want your dog to be acting and it's

754
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,159
setting your dog

755
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,000
kind of up for success because then they

756
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,760
know what you want

757
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,240
them to be doing um and i guess the

758
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,520
other point with setting them up for

759
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,440
success is making sure they're like

760
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,159
well exercised and things like that and

761
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:08,799
then

762
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,720
the the last bullet is just about

763
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,919
negative punishment it's

764
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,279
removing the things that lead to

765
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,120
undesired behavior so if

766
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,799
your trash is in the kitchen and it's

767
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,120
uncovered and it just smells so good

768
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,720
maybe get a cover for it maybe put it in

769
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,480
another room maybe put it in a cupboard

770
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,440
and that removes a stimulus that is

771
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,279
leading to your dog maybe getting into

772
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,320
the trash

773
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,840
so that's that's the gist of it the

774
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,440
um it's backed up it's really

775
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,559
uh well regarded the american veterinary

776
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,760
society of annual

777
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,360
animal behavior they recommend that

778
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,120
training should focus on reinforcing

779
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,400
desired behaviors

780
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,919
removing the reinforcer for

781
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,840
inappropriate behaviors and addressing

782
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,440
the emotional state and environmental

783
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,240
conditions

784
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,960
uh driving the undesirable behavior so

785
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,360
that's

786
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,320
that's yeah i think there's a lot of

787
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,080
community backing in this right now and

788
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,440
this is kind of where

789
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,640
uh dog training is at and hopefully

790
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,679
moves more towards in the future so

791
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,760
the what you often do is clicker

792
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,799
training and i

793
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,279
should have had a clicker with me but

794
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,960
it's basically a device that makes a

795
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,840
like

796
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,320
noise and so what you do is you pair

797
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,440
that with food

798
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,080
so you they call it priming the clicker

799
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,760
or charging the clicker so

800
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,320
it's basically you make a click when you

801
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,600
first get it and you give your dog a

802
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:25,919
treat

803
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,360
you make a click give your dog a treat

804
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,279
your dog's gonna associate like oh

805
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,400
this click is the reward sound um so

806
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,799
once

807
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,720
it's primed and once it's charged like

808
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,640
that you can use it to

809
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,880
mark the exact moment of good behavior

810
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,960
maybe you're training your dog for

811
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,080
a weight or a stay from very far away

812
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,240
you can't necessarily train that and

813
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,760
give them food right away

814
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,440
but you can use the clicker at a

815
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,880
distance to say

816
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
okay you waited the duration i want

817
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,720
here's your click that's a reward

818
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,159
then you can release them and they can

819
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,559
come get a treat but it it

820
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,559
gives them that exact moment in their

821
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,760
mind where

822
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,480
they can associate like i just did a

823
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,000
good thing this is what they wanted me

824
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,320
to do i nailed it and now i'm going to

825
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,440
get a reward for it

826
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,919
so it it's really used to mark up like

827
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,520
precise moment

828
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,000
so the dog's then rewarded and it's used

829
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,679
in way more than dogs you can use a trim

830
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,440
cast you can use a trained dolphin

831
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,799
you can use it to train your horses you

832
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,720
can use it to train chickens

833
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,320
and the chickens actually used to be an

834
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,679
advanced dog seminar i don't think

835
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,960
they're offering it anymore

836
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,039
but they would bring dog trainers and

837
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,640
have them train chickens because the

838
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,600
chickens just

839
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,080
they had no sense or they didn't respond

840
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,799
at all to

841
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,200
any sort of kind of punishment or

842
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,720
negative reinforcement

843
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,000
um so you really just had to be shaping

844
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,880
their behavior with food and clicks

845
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,240
so that was kind of like an advanced

846
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,360
method because dogs can kind of

847
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,720
understand how you're feeling and if

848
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,840
you're mad at them

849
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,080
the chickens were like made you kind of

850
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,960
into a pure positive trainer

851
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,520
so there's two there's two modes of

852
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,200
positive reinforcement training one is

853
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,120
capturing a desired behavior

854
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,840
so what i did for my dog he kind of grew

855
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,919
up at work with me so i needed him to

856
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,440
behave well at work otherwise it was

857
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,120
very embarrassing if it was barking and

858
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,559
kind of not acceptable

859
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,520
so when he would lay under my desk when

860
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,039
he would settle down i would

861
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,919
sneak him a treat like when he would

862
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:18,640
kind of like

863
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,279
lay down and then exhale and like let

864
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,720
let all his tension out i would give him

865
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,880
a treat to say like oh you're relaxing

866
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,600
this is a great thing to do

867
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,960
and that method's called capturing

868
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,799
calmness it's capturing a behavior he's

869
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,600
already doing

870
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,360
but it's reinforcing it so then he kind

871
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,799
of learns like okay

872
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,559
my job is to lay down and like hang out

873
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,640
and relax my job isn't to like guard

874
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,440
your cubicle

875
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,080
my job isn't to chew on your computer

876
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,919
wires my job is just to like chill here

877
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,679
and hang like this is my spot

878
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,159
um and then you can also capture tricks

879
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,320
so say you're training your dog

880
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,159
and you're just waiting for them to

881
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,679
offer something and then out of nowhere

882
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,720
they do like a big

883
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,919
jump and spin around you can click and

884
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,679
capture that behavior and that's that's

885
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,279
what capturing is it's taking something

886
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,720
your dog is offering

887
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,840
um and using it to

888
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,399
or and encouraging it i guess so the

889
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,320
other one is called shaping

890
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
and this is much more common so say you

891
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,919
are going to

892
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,480
ask your dog to sit you might have a

893
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,600
freak in your hand

894
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,760
and you move it towards their face so

895
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,200
they back up back up and look up and

896
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,880
then eventually they'll sit down

897
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,720
then as soon as they sit you pair the

898
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,080
behavior with the command sit

899
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,520
maybe you click and then you give the

900
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,760
dog the treat to reward the behavior so

901
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,480
that's

902
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,240
that's shaping your dog into the sitting

903
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,799
position

904
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,840
and then uh rewarding the behavior so

905
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,279
you're kind of encouraging it and then

906
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,320
you

907
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,240
back off of that slowly so it's like

908
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,600
maybe you won't push the treat in their

909
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,039
face and see if they offer the sit and

910
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,200
then you can capture it more and more

911
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,279
but yeah it also associates a word or a

912
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,360
hand signal at the time that they do it

913
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,120
so they're they put all those pieces

914
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,279
together in their mind like

915
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,279
oh this word means do this behavior and

916
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,279
that means i get a treat like

917
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,120
they'll they'll connect the dots there

918
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,039
um another example a more advanced

919
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,480
example is hold an item

920
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
so hold and that's when they hold an

921
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,080
item in their mouth so might you might

922
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,279
have a clicker and you might put an

923
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,480
object on the floor

924
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,000
and they look at it at first they're

925
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,760
just like what's this you click for them

926
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,960
paying attention to it

927
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,559
and then you start raising the criteria

928
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,080
so maybe the next session you'll click

929
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,279
if they go over and

930
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,120
touch it with their nose then the next

931
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,960
one if they start chewing on it like

932
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
okay yeah that's good that's what i want

933
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,480
and then you kind of withdraw that and

934
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,799
raise the criteria again

935
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,480
so the next thing you would do is maybe

936
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,039
they'd be picking up the object

937
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,399
so then they pick up the object and

938
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,600
you're like oh that's exactly what i

939
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,720
wanted you to do you click that so

940
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,080
hopefully the next time they start

941
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,760
offering picking up the object

942
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,520
you just keep increasing the duration

943
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,919
longer and longer for them to hold it

944
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:46,640
and then

945
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,399
increasing that whole duration and

946
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,679
eventually they're going to have hold so

947
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,520
that's that's the idea behind shaping is

948
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,159
you're

949
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,240
slowly shaping the behaviors that you

950
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,679
want them to be doing

951
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,360
and yeah that's it's most powerful i

952
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,039
think in trick

953
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,880
um and then i think capturing is good

954
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,399
for kind of like calmness and things

955
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,200
like this

956
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,159
another big one just uh just fyi about

957
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,519
10 minutes left for you

958
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,679
cool i i'm pretty close to finishing uh

959
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,120
two more slides and then i'll do a

960
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,880
disaster of a demo

961
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,000
right on cool so the last thing

962
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,159
is dog body language or the second last

963
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,519
thing is dog body language

964
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,039
um the the dogs have a lot of calming

965
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,080
signals and i

966
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,240
see so often people post onlines like oh

967
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,840
look how cute this is

968
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,399
um when it's like squinting or like

969
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,000
whale lying at you and it's like

970
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,159
okay it's it actually looks kind of

971
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,080
nervous so these are a good thing to

972
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,279
learn especially when you're

973
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,360
like training your dog um because if

974
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,960
they're if they're yawning

975
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,480
if they're lip licking like whenever i

976
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,760
pull out my phone and stick it in my

977
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,200
dog's face she gives a yawn and it's

978
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,480
like okay you you don't like that i

979
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,600
should probably be pairing it with

980
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,360
treats there she might lick her lips

981
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,200
and that's that's something telling you

982
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,880
to kind of calm down

983
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,799
whale eyes or side eyes can indicate

984
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,000
nervousness like

985
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
they're not looking directly at you but

986
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,360
they're scared enough that they're

987
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,000
trying to keep their

988
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
eyes on you or not scared but nervous

989
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,039
enough that they're trying to keep their

990
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,159
eyes on you

991
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,000
they might turn their head away and

992
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,679
avoid your gaze

993
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,919
the squinting and appeasement happens a

994
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,039
lot

995
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,880
and then sniffing is avoidance so if

996
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,519
you're uh taking your dog and it's like

997
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,799
you're asking it to do something it's

998
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,320
like oh i'm just gonna sniff over here

999
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,840
but there's nothing really to sniff over

1000
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,279
there it might just be kind of avoiding

1001
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,799
that situation

1002
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,720
and flattening the ears is another big

1003
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,840
one

1004
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,200
so when i got or when we got ava

1005
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,360
she must have been abused before we got

1006
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,120
her because i couldn't even grab her

1007
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,600
collar

1008
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,399
without her peeing on the floor and that

1009
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,679
that's something for me that's

1010
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,679
kind of shocking because it's like okay

1011
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:40,799
this dog has

1012
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,519
been conditioned like very seriously

1013
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,600
that i can't grab her collar without her

1014
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,399
peen

1015
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,760
so it really like while i felt like oh

1016
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,320
i'm not

1017
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,000
doing anything to hurt you i'm not

1018
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,519
abusing you or anything like that

1019
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,360
it was very scary for her in that

1020
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,120
situation and i

1021
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,679
like now with her her and i play very

1022
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:00,799
rough she'll

1023
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,200
gnaw on me i'll push her around and grab

1024
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,960
her skin and stuff like that

1025
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,760
and i think it's a lot easier to hurt a

1026
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,919
dog's feelings than it is to hurt a dog

1027
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,360
so that's something is when you're

1028
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,559
training dogs and when you're working

1029
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,840
with dogs you really have to keep your

1030
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,960
emotions in check

1031
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,240
because it's like you might be having a

1032
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,000
bad day you might be mad and you might

1033
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,320
uh while you're not hitting your dog or

1034
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
hurting it like you might also be

1035
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,559
angry and directing that toward the dog

1036
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,840
and i think that can be

1037
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,039
uh very damaging so keep your emotions

1038
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,159
in check when training your dogs and

1039
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:30,559
working

1040
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,039
with your dogs and walking your dogs and

1041
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,480
yeah just build that really positive

1042
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,519
relationship

1043
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,559
the last thing is when you're if your

1044
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,240
dog's misbehaving really look at the

1045
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,760
energy levels

1046
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,960
so exercise is so key like very

1047
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,519
very often like if the dog's going crazy

1048
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,360
it might it's

1049
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,600
often just not getting enough exercise

1050
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,559
so

1051
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,200
for example my dog ava she barks super

1052
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,880
louder she can bark super loud

1053
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,279
if she's not exercised she will bark at

1054
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,559
anything and it

1055
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,559
hurts your ears but if you take her for

1056
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,919
like a long walk

1057
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,159
um she she'll sleep the rest of the day

1058
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,840
so if she gets that level of exercise

1059
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,520
she'll be calm throughout the day

1060
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,079
um so yeah for that it's recommended

1061
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,239
long walks jogs plain fetch

1062
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,079
for dogs less than one year old you

1063
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,280
don't want to take them for runs or

1064
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,399
anything because their joints are still

1065
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,440
developing but

1066
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,879
if your dog's great more than one year

1067
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,639
old um yeah you

1068
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,800
you can you can death march it death

1069
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,199
march it in the nicest way possible

1070
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,520
so here's a demo um i'm gonna try to

1071
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,119
pull up my webcam so i can make sure

1072
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,480
that i can see the setup here so give me

1073
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,679
a minute to get this

1074
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,199
set up show all webcams here we go

1075
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,879
i will try to get this on my floor so we

1076
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,598
can see the dog

1077
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,520
it may take a second for the uh camera

1078
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,639
to show up for

1079
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,119
folks on the link uh on the webinar

1080
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,800
rather

1081
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,000
it's cool is the camera not

1082
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,200
uh i don't see it yet

1083
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,799
well myself on maybe no

1084
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,280
video is not showing up um

1085
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,960
let me see if there's anything that

1086
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,200
needs to be done on this end

1087
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,320
oh well something changed do you see a

1088
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,400
dog

1089
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,359
do you see a floor uh several people say

1090
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,320
they can see it

1091
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,440
oh cool that works for me

1092
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,760
so i was gonna have a nice grand finale

1093
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,440
with a backstall but ava hurt her left

1094
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,480
leg earlier so

1095
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,400
i will not try to do that but let's try

1096
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,280
to get her in frame here

1097
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,800
you're back okay come on turn around sit

1098
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,400

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,920
that's very good she just offers her

1102
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,400
head down

1103
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,880
head down very good

1104
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,320
can you roll over oh

1105
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,599

1106
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,880

1109
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,640

thank you very much so

1114
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,119
that that will be the extent of the demo

1115
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,000
normally she

1116
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,480
also jumps on my back but since her back

1117
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,720
leg is a little hurt i don't want her

1118
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,640
flying off the ground like that so

1119
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,560
hopefully that was enjoyable but

1120
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,640
uh that a lot of credit in that goes to

1121
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,920
my girlfriend who is the

1122
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,040
real talent of dog trainer in the family

1123
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,119
do you think you could do us a favor and

1124
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,560
post a video sometime

1125
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,040
of your dog doing these tricks cool yeah

1126
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,320
i will i'll post that to my youtube

1127
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,760
channel sometime

1128
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,320
and could you tell us what your youtube

1129
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,440
channel is

1130
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,599
yeah so if you go to the easiest way to

1131
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,599
get to it is going to

1132
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,359
uh https colon slash cybering.cc that'll

1133
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,480
have a link there

1134
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,560
um but my youtube channel i believe i

1135
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,680
have the url

1136
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,839
cybering so like youtube.com forward

1137
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,000
slash c forward slash cybering

1138
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,760
uh should get to it as well but yeah the

1139
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,680
cybering.cc url

1140
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,440
is kind of my index that has all that

1141
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,800
stuff

1142
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,200
fantastic uh there have been a couple of

1143
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:27,839
questions

1144
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,640
uh there's one regex question go but i

1145
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:30,960
think

1146
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,280
perhaps it may be something better to

1147
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,960
answer on twitter because there's no way

1148
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,079
i'm going to be able to read that

1149
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,760
coherently enough for you to answer it

1150
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,800
here

1151
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,079
i'll give it a shot is it the

1152
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,079
it's about div tags in

1153
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,400
i i was stumped recently using regex to

1154
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,000
parse html

1155
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,640
which is i i know a bit of a warning

1156
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,359
sign for

1157
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,880
those of us who understand the

1158
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,640
difficulties there

1159
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,800
uh they were trying to find all the div

1160
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,480
class equals name x

1161
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,760
tags in a block but they needed to deal

1162
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,079
with

1163
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,000
nested div within that any suggestions

1164
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,359
use an html parser in that case um

1165
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,920
yeah nesting is going to be very

1166
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,160
difficult so you could maybe do a stingy

1167
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,119
match so maybe you're not going beyond

1168
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,800
what you want so that's like the

1169
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
dot star question mark and so it'll

1170
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,480
match as little as possible between a

1171
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,920
div tag and then the class

1172
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,720
attribute but really in that case like

1173
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,400
grab something if you're using python

1174
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,040
grab beautiful soup and parse the html

1175
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,280
and then go and find those elements with

1176
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,520
css selectors

1177
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,800
fantastic yeah um so there's a couple of

1178
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,599
dog questions

1179
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,359
one person asks does this work on cats

1180
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,160
yes it should um i've i don't have a cat

1181
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,040
but i've seen

1182
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,880
people saying that you can use clicker

1183
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,680
training with cats

1184
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,200
and lions and tigers my girlfriend says

1185
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,599
so it works on big cats as well

1186
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,119
so absolutely give it a shot get some

1187
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,800
treats that your cat loves

1188
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,400
pair it with a clicker and i'm sure

1189
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,920
there's a ton of youtube videos on it

1190
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,680
fantastic and this person has asked what

1191
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,680
if your dog forgets a trick

1192
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,240
mine keeps for getting dead do you have

1193
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,000
any tips

1194
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
i think it's just spaced repetitions the

1195
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,359
same that you do when you're learning

1196
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,440
with flash cards is kind of making sure

1197
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,640
that you reinforce it

1198
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,119
every couple of days or every week until

1199
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,320
it's really

1200
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,040
driven in there but yeah besides that

1201
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,599
sometimes

1202
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,200
sometimes dogs only have so much they

1203
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,720
can fit in their head and there's a

1204
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,160
couple good smells outside they want to

1205
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,240
remember too

1206
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,440
yeah i think there's a lot of good

1207
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,520
smells outside we all are interested in

1208
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,000
these days

1209
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,839
yeah especially now when we can't go

1210
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,440
outside

1211
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,480
move right on right on uh so

1212
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,000
uh i don't see well most of the other

1213
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,839
questions are about video which

1214
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,760
uh yeah a video on this stream has been

1215
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,760
a little bit flaky today

1216
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,520
um terribly sorry about that uh

1217
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,680
i have recorded what i can for this one

1218
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,520
and i've asked our lovely presenters

1219
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,880
cybering here to

1220
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,160
post the video to youtube when able uh

1221
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,440
because well i i actually feel a little

1222
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,040
sad because i didn't get to see the dog

1223
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,960
what what's your twitter handle tweeted

1224
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,440
at you oh i'm union

1225
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,960
okay right on um awesome

1226
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,079
so uh thank you very much for oh we've

1227
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,640
got one more

1228
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,599
uh one person's asking if they can teach

1229
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,200
other tricks to the dog

1230
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,079
uh but that i think you kind of covered

1231
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:42,960
earlier

1232
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,839
with uh observing for desired behavior

1233
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,720
and rewarding it

1234
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,359
what was it can you teach other tricks

1235
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,119
yeah they they want to know if the dog

1236
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,560
can learn other tricks

1237
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,760
yeah absolutely like yeah this this can

1238
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,720
be used to

1239
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,280
get almost every behavior and i think if

1240
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,040
you search whatever behavior or whatever

1241
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,160
trick you want on youtube

1242
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,760
and maybe a guide to positive

1243
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,160
reinforcement for that specifically

1244
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,599
