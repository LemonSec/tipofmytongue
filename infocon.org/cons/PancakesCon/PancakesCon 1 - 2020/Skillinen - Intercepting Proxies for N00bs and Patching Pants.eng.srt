1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
ahead and give sylvia control over here

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,679
all right thank you very much

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,519
i hope everyone's had a great time today

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,599
at pancakes con i know i sure have i've

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,400
learned a ton

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,160
incredibly excited to be speaking at

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,520
this virtual con

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,080
and i hope you enjoy so this

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,880
presentation

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,039
is aimed for people who have never

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,880
really investigated web application

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,480
security before

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,320
i know when i was first getting started

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,399
off i really could have used a talk like

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:32,800
this

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,880
so seeing something aimed at new people

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,719
i just had to throw at it we're going to

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,719
talk about intercepting proxies

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,120
the why we might use them some of the

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,079
options available

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,600
out there and then we're going to have a

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,200
live demo assuming that

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,399
the internet and demo gods do not decide

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,480
i'm not going to do that

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,760
so let's jump into the why

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,399
i guess i should start with actually who

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,920
so i'm sylvia killenan

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,000
i'm a qa tester i focus on web

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,760
application security

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,519
that puts me in kind of an interesting

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,119
space halfway between

32
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,360
qa and appsec that gives me a lot of

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,880
opportunity to do neat stuff and also

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,920
very little opportunity to change policy

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,080
so kind of an interesting space to

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
inhabit

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,360
with that in mind if you haven't heard

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,000
some of these

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,479
words you are probably still ahead of

40
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,079
where i was when i started i'm going to

41
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,840
try and define stuff but if questions

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,720
come up

43
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,320
i'll do my best to answer them during

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,799
the presentation

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,920
so when we're talking about a web proxy

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,360
this is what happens beneath the

47
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,840
application or beneath the ui layer

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,880
at the protocol layer if you're familiar

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,640
with the osi model we're going to shift

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,479
that layer just a little bit

51
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,560
if you're not familiar with osi don't

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,240
worry about it we're going to talk the

53
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,079
same language the web applications talk

54
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,680
when they are not showing you the shiny

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,640
screen

56
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,920
so we're going to learn what the web

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
app's doing we're going to see where

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,439
else it might be sending data

59
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,439
and how it might send and receive that

60
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,759
how it might encode that

61
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,360
that's where life gets really

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,120
interesting for me

63
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
the best tools i've had in order to do

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,239
this are

65
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,680
owasp zap or zaproxy burp suite

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,319
and the humble developer tools built

67
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,760
into your browser

68
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,879
there are of course many more than this

69
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,160
we're going to go over some of their

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
features some of their pros and cons as

71
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,480
we go

72
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,160
as we start of course you have to think

73
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,120
about testing

74
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,760
scope all of these tools with the

75
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,599
exception of developer tools which kind

76
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,040
of does it implicitly

77
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,080
will set a scope everything in that

78
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,400
scope can will be scanned this can be a

79
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,959
hostile act

80
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,640
the obligatory disclaimer is please

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,560
don't scan stuff you don't own

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,400
this is a hacker con you make your own

83
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,599
choices

84
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,680
uh burp and zaproxy have attack tools

85
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,760
to test responsibly constrain them to

86
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,400
your target

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,120
tools doesn't so much have attack tools

88
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,720
but we'll see what it does have because

89
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,239
there's a couple things where it really

90
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,400
is the best choice

91
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,239
everything out of your scope can be

92
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,239
ignored so you want to define it

93
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,319
carefully otherwise you can spend hours

94
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,920
spinning around on

95
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,800
well why can't i see this thing coming

96
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,280
in

97
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,319
no it's out of scope oops i speak with

98
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,599
the voice of experience here

99
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,159
starting at the most simple developer

100
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,319
tools you press control shift i

101
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,040
in your browser chrome is really good at

102
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,120
it firefox and edge have it do

103
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,599
you can view and intercept your page

104
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,280
source and your dom

105
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,200
you can view and intercept requests and

106
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,879
responses coming through

107
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,480
you can see scripts running in the

108
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,560
console which is great

109
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,159
and you can see your includes very

110
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,159
easily

111
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,400
we're going to get there in a minute

112
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,280
burp suite

113
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,840
has many levels of

114
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,080
access to its tools i guess i should say

115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,599
it actually has three

116
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,280
there's community there's pro there's

117
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
enterprise i'm going to limit everything

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,959
we do in this demo to the community

119
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,680
edition

120
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,360
you don't have to pay for it it

121
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
unfortunately does not include the

122
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
spider which is

123
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,959
great

124
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,440
that's kind of too bad that proxy does

125
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,720
have a spider

126
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,240
again we can view and intercept our

127
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,919
requests and responses that's kind of

128
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,919
the flagship feature of the intercepting

129
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,400
proxy

130
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,199
all of these other things intruder

131
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,440
repeater so on and so forth

132
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,560
are tabs so we're talking about fuzzing

133
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,639
you're all probably familiar with that

134
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,000
it's the idea of throwing

135
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,919
a whole bunch of requests at a field and

136
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,360
seeing what it does

137
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,479
how does it fall over when you send

138
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,560
content it doesn't expect or you send a

139
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,199
whole bunch of content it does expect

140
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,759
you can manually resend requests which

141
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,240
is

142
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
a major advantage that both burp and

143
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,120
zaproxy have over developer tools

144
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,199
you can look at things like statistical

145
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,280
analysis of tokens which is a feature

146
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,639
that

147
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,479
as far as i'm aware burp community is

148
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,960
the only free proxy that has that

149
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,320
i could be wrong decoder comparer

150
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,800
all very good burp and zaproxy are both

151
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,160
extendable through their own

152
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,560
scripting and apis which is also great

153
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,680
for those of you who like to write code

154
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,919
as far as free stuff goes zaproxy

155
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,320
probably has the most functions

156
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,960
it's maintained by owasp they're awesome

157
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,240
so that makes it my favorite by far

158
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
that bias is definitely going to be on

159
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,759
display here in a minute

160
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,080
uh customizable alerts automated

161
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,800
spidering

162
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,120
ajax spidering there's been kind of a

163
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,720
historical issue where

164
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,680
proxying asynchronous requests is just

165
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,160
not the easiest thing to do

166
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
and over the past few years these proxy

167
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,759
tools have gotten

168
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,199
so much better in that respect zaprox's

169
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,160
ajax spider

170
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,199
is honestly really sweet there's a hud

171
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:05,680
mode i

172
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,199
encourage you to go and play with the

173
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,600
tutorial i think it's great

174
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,919
and

175
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,000
the for the free tier

176
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,080
zaproxy is also automatable and

177
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,160
includable in your build pipeline

178
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,120
which is fantastic if you are in an

179
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,160
environment

180
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,080
pushing builds all the time and needing

181
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,680
a way to scan them for major

182
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,600
vulnerabilities

183
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,440
it won't necessarily make your build

184
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,720
pass

185
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,680
but it can catch build failures really

186
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,639
fast

187
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,680
and that's very valuable

188
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,639
so before you start go out download

189
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,600
these tools

190
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,919
hook your browser to it and go wait a

191
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,440
minute nothing works

192
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,039
modern browsers using hsts that being

193
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,880
strict transport security

194
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,960
mean that you cannot ignore certificate

195
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,479
errors

196
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,479
the way you get around this is that burp

197
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,720
and zaproxy issue their own certificates

198
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,560
these are unique per instance and you

199
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,080
can regenerate them with a touch of a

200
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,039
button

201
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,880
you need to install them in your browser

202
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
if you want to do anything over tls

203
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,240
that is using hsts that's pretty

204
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,199
straightforward

205
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,720
there's a ton of tutorials so i'm not

206
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,840
going to cover it here

207
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,840
so for demo time we're going to use the

208
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,440
over the wire.org

209
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,000
notice exercise i assume i'm pronouncing

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,520
that correctly i could be completely

211
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,758
wrong

212
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,680
this is an exercise all about server

213
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
side web security

214
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,759
if you saw that awesome ctf panel

215
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,880
earlier today

216
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,479
this was actually one of the ones

217
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,160
mentioned and

218
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,840
i highly encourage folks who are just

219
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,680
getting started with web security

220
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,520
to go out there take a look at it and

221
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,759
mess around even if you're not just

222
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,800
getting started

223
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,080
you're gonna blow through the first few

224
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
exercises real quick

225
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,680
and then they start to get really cool

226
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,280
so here we are on level one

227
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,599
we can't just view source the password

228
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,639
for the next level is

229
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,560
on this page but right clicking has been

230
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,960
blocked

231
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
so starting with our most basic our

232
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,879
chrome developer tools

233
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,280
we're going to ctrl shift i pull up this

234
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,520
cool panel

235
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,120
and you can see a whole bunch of tabs

236
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
here the network

237
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,240
tab will record all network traffic if

238
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,479
there were any javascript

239
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,960
there doesn't appear to be possibly

240
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,520
because

241
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,960
the server says you're not allowed to

242
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,240
load the favicon yay

243
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,000
but we can also view the page source

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
without right clicking

245
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,839
so much for that and there's our

246
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,159
password

247
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,039
quick and easy right

248
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
while we're in developer tools we can

249
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,480
explore a little bit

250
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,760
and see ah here are any sources that

251
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,040
might have been included

252
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,720
there was a css

253
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,760
there's an image here we can preview it

254
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,800
there's some javascript and even though

255
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,040
we got that 401 over on the network tab

256
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,480
we can see everything that's in the

257
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,360
browser dev tools is really great for

258
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,959
this because your browser has to know

259
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,399
what's going on on the page

260
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,920
obviously so it will display

261
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
all of it to you allow you to set

262
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,040
breakpoints

263
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,640
investigate the dom if you have

264
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,160
something a little more complicated than

265
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,480
this

266
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,200
interfere with its operations this is a

267
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
really great way to say

268
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,920
oh your your client side validation is

269
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,680
bugging me

270
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,959
go away and just turn it off

271
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,399
we didn't actually need to interact with

272
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,480
the network at all here

273
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,040
the one thing that i wish developer

274
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,000
tools had

275
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
and it doesn't which makes sense because

276
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,880
it's not necessarily made as a security

277
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,600
tool

278
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,080
is the ability to tamper with and resend

279
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,120
requests

280
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,959
and for that we need to go to a little

281
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,239
bit more of an advanced tool

282
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,760
so this is a wasp zap

283
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,800
this ui is a little bit more dense see a

284
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,399
lot of different tabs going on here

285
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,680
i have my firefox browser here

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
and you can see over this wee little

287
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,120
corner i have

288
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,800
boxy proxy now this is just one of many

289
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,839
proxy managers that's good for

290
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,839
handling various different proxies you

291
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,839
can use it for intercepting proxies like

292
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,160
this

293
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
you can also use it for web proxies if

294
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,880
that's your gem

295
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,279
pre-configure and then it's as easy as

296
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,680
clicking to point your browser at it

297
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,719
i really enjoy that

298
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,839
so let's jump into exercise

299
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,560
three

300
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,760
if it'll load for me here

301
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:15,839
if not i'll go back into chrome

302
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:29,839
okay there we go

303
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:43,839
like that

304
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,360
okay that's an interesting error let's

305
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,160
actually go and

306
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,360
troubleshoot that real quick

307
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,800
now something that is interesting to

308
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,040
note is that

309
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,720
chrome and edge actually work through

310
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
the system proxy so you need to

311
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,120
set it

312
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,440
i'm trying to go to zap so that's

313
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,839
accurate there we go

314
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,360
you need to set it in your windows

315
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,160
settings now that is going to channel

316
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,120
all of my traffic through my proxy in

317
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,680
fact

318
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,040
remember when i was saying hey this

319
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,480
won't work right out of the box if your

320
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,880
certs

321
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,720
don't line up fortunately this doesn't

322
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,040
enforce hsts or i would be doing

323
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,720
cert installation instead of trying to

324
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,760
demo right now

325
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,720
ah there we go

326
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,320
that is really not happy is it

327
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,399
oh because i'm putting in the wrong

328
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
password

329
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,279
and there we have it there is nothing on

330
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,160
this page

331
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,560
and indeed if we go and look at the

332
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,600
elements

333
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,440
hold up the style sheet because for the

334
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,120
course of this exercise we're ignoring

335
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,839
that

336
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,839
there is in fact nothing on this page

337
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,839
so let's jump over into zaproxy

338
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,160
we can see here that we did a get

339
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,600
and we can actually do an attack

340
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,120
and spider this page

341
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,360
what that will do is follow every link

342
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,920
look in every nook and cranny this can

343
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,719
actually find

344
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
and we can see that some things have

345
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,440
popped up here

346
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,560
so we have a robots.txt this tells

347
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,040
various robots hey don't look in these

348
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,560
directories

349
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,760
and here we have something called secret

350
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,560
clearly this is extremely secret because

351
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,920
it has had its

352
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,560
ease replaced with numbers three let's

353
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,079
actually put that in our browser

354
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,959
see what we can find

355
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,360
so we have something called users.txt

356
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,360
and in fact there's our password

357
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,800
so i'm going to grab that one move us on

358
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,839
to nadus4

359
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,680
and remember to take off

360
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,839
that directory and file as i go

361
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
in addition i'm going to move us over to

362
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
burp suite so you can see a demo of that

363
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,839
as well

364
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,959
i change the default port if you're

365
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,959
running two proxies simultaneously and

366
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,320
try to bind them to the same port they

367
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,880
will not work

368
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,199
this can be frustrating especially if

369
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,360
you are chaining proxies

370
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,519
there was a mention of microsoft fiddler

371
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,000
earlier

372
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,920
the reason you might chain proxies is

373
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,079
because some are better at supporting

374
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,320
different methods of authentication than

375
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,120
others

376
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,199
so for instance fiddler is the easiest

377
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,360
way i've ever seen to proxy kerberos

378
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,959
authentication

379
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,800
kerberos can be a big pain in the neck

380
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,240
if you don't

381
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,160
handle it just exactly the way it wants

382
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,360
to be handled

383
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,000
so having microsoft's native proxy

384
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,880
handle that

385
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,519
smoothly makes your life way easier

386
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,240
fiddler does

387
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
not have some of the nicer features that

388
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,720
i've seen out of zaproxy or burp suite

389
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,440
so in order to make that work you tell

390
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,959
your first proxy that you want to use

391
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:41,759
the features

392
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,759
to point at your second proxy that can

393
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,279
use the authentication

394
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,160
and you're good to go

395
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,320
on different ports always

396
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,800
so i've taken up the liberty in both of

397
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,560
these to set up a scope

398
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,120
beforehand you can see that i've already

399
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,279
got natas 4 in here

400
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,800
i'm going to load it in chrome

401
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,839
yes go

402
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,199
and i'm going to close developer tools

403
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:23,839
so we can see what's going on here

404
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,399
let's see if we can load it in

405
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,839
uh firefox and point to burp

406
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,359
there we go

407
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,839
you didn't like that did you

408
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,560
okay so burp actually threw an error and

409
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,319
said i couldn't authenticate to that

410
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,839
i'm going to try once more and make sure

411
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,400
i actually copied the entire password

412
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,119
there we go you are just you are

413
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,400
visiting from

414
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,959
some null value while authorized users

415
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:25,839
can come

416
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,999
[Music]

417
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
only

418
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,280
all right it looks like we're in some

419
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,640
technical difficulties

420
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,440
uh you cut out there for just a minute

421
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,240
let's see if

422
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,559
are you there i'm here can you hear me

423
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,480
now

424
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,679
all right wonderful thank you so i'm

425
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,679
going to repeat just a little bit

426
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,880
if you're thinking through this for the

427
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,200
first time you do research about

428
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,640
how do i tell a website where i'm from

429
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,280
if you're a little more experienced or

430
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,520
you are already familiar with

431
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,000
how the web works you would say aha

432
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,679
that's the referrer header

433
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,840
i'm going to send that to my repeater

434
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,600
which allows me to manually tamper

435
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,720
requests

436
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,840
i'm going to paste my value in here

437
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,120
make sure i've got the whole thing

438
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,880
including the slash at the end

439
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,840
and then i'm going to send and

440
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,879
the site has rendered

441
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,640
see if i can find

442
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,840
my password

443
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,000
nope didn't like it let's jump back into

444
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,600
the browser and see what it actually

445
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,840
said

446
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,919
okay apparently that didn't take it so

447
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,280
instead we're going to go back into the

448
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,919
proxy

449
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,679
we're going to turn intercept on which

450
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,919
means all traffic will be channeled to

451
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,080
the proxy instead of

452
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,440
channeled to the browser

453
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
and we're going to refresh the page and

454
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,520
try it again

455
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,559
same trick different way to get there

456
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,600
we're going to hit forward

457
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,760
jump back into the browser wrong browser

458
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,799
access granted so i hope that's been an

459
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,480
interesting display

460
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,080
this is the nuts and bolts of using a

461
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,039
proxy

462
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,120
all of these have features that are way

463
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,280
more advanced than i am demoing here

464
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,039
you can do some incredibly cool things

465
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,280
with the fuzzers in either zap roxy or

466
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,320
burp

467
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,960
and if you have any questions now's the

468
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,280
moment

469
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,280
all right so there was one question and

470
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,559
it was

471
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,080
someone saying that they were originally

472
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,159
going to present a red team osn

473
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,200
firefox variant do you think fiddler is

474
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,960
a good external tool to use for web

475
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,360
browsers

476
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,880
i think it is it has some limitations

477
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,360
and i haven't used it for probably the

478
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,400
past

479
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,280
nine ten months so there may have been

480
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,799
some features implemented that i don't

481
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,280
know about

482
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,480
fiddler is great for microsoft only

483
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,600
environments

484
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,360
as i mentioned it's great for kerberos

485
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,039
authentication

486
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,840
and if you're looking for

487
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,400
something that your company will accept

488
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,720
or something that

489
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,320
your environment will support easily

490
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,840
it's a really good one

491
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,880
i do like the fuzzers in zaproxy better

492
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,200
than

493
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,640
either of the other options i've

494
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,600
mentioned in this talk

495
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,840
all right uh there are no more questions

496
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
on this side

497
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,000
so on to the next bit

498
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,520
great let's talk about patching

499
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:31,840
clothes out of all this jazz

500
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,360
all right as a quick note

501
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,360
any photo you see that is not attributed

502
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,520
to someone else is a photo of my actual

503
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,840
pants

504
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,760
you're going to see some pretty janky

505
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,280
patches today

506
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,080
as well as hopefully some better ones

507
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,760
and let's talk through why that would be

508
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,799
interesting

509
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,320
so we've all heard you have to keep it

510
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,080
patched mostly in relationship to

511
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,159
servers and software

512
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,000
a lot of people tell you it's easier to

513
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,840
replace worn out clothes and most of the

514
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,679
time they're actually right

515
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,480
we live in the era of fast fashion where

516
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,240
you can go down to the store and buy

517
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,840
something that will probably fit you and

518
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,799
look okay

519
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,640
for not all that much money but that

520
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,720
doesn't mean it's your only choice

521
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,600
if you don't like what's on offer or if

522
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,039
you have other reasons to patch

523
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,000
something

524
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,400
if you're hard to fit this is a good way

525
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,520
to keep your clothes running

526
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,240
writing this the tagline for this slide

527
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,919
those are too good to work in i can hear

528
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,280
it in my grandmother's voice

529
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,760
especially for folks who lived through

530
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,120
economic troubles

531
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
who may have lived through political

532
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,520
social military troubles

533
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,320
keeping your clothes in one piece can be

534
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,440
really important

535
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,919
you can do it visibly or invisibly you

536
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,520
can do it with or without a sewing

537
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,880
machine and you can do it with or

538
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,559
without any sewing experience

539
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,520
whatsoever whatsoever

540
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,440
you can patch for fashion as well as

541
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,679
function this can always be a way of

542
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,039
signaling community

543
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,280
whether that's about music whether

544
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,799
that's

545
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,120
punks have been doing this since punks

546
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,440
military and first responder folks have

547
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,240
entire

548
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,480
lexicons of patches that i don't even

549
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,880
know how to read

550
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,720
and you've probably seen people walking

551
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,320
around with national flags on their

552
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,440
jackets

553
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,679
whether or not they're signaling

554
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,880
anything aside from affiliation

555
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,559
this is a really big thing and

556
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,480
unfortunately it's too much to go into

557
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,440
here

558
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,159
but people are always signaling through

559
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,520
fashion

560
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,120
what they might be interested in what

561
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
they might be like

562
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,039
what they might want you to think

563
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,720
they're like

564
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,559
it's an entire language and fascinates

565
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,200
me to no end

566
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,159
also there's the matter of

567
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,400
sustainability so this guy

568
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,919
is wearing a boro robe this is truly an

569
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,679
extreme

570
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,600
some of these textiles can be hundreds

571
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,120
of years old

572
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,840
and it's very likely that every inch of

573
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,640
that fabric

574
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,400
is padded three to five layers thick

575
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,320
that gentleman is probably quite warm in

576
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,240
that room

577
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,400
as you can see they're also really

578
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,840
interesting looking

579
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,760
some of these can be embroidered

580
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,360
hem to collar i kid you not

581
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,440
and they can be extremely valuable as

582
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,200
well

583
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,159
when these were created boro is a

584
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,840
japanese art but certainly

585
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,080
japan is not the only region that's

586
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,360
developed a patching process like this

587
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,279
it is a little bit of an extreme case

588
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,400
because

589
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,120
growing fiber plants on an archipelago

590
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,720
with an extremely variable climate is

591
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,720
not easy

592
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,840
at the time this was begun

593
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,039
every scrap of fabric was precious every

594
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,799
scrap was something that you wanted to

595
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,279
keep

596
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,360
functional as long as it could be kept

597
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,120
so you end up with these robes that were

598
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,080
handed down person to person to person

599
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,120
over centuries

600
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,720
now i'm not saying we have to take it to

601
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,200
that extreme in the modern age but i am

602
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,960
saying that my oldest pair of jeans is

603
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,720
about three times the lifespan of my

604
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,600
average pair of jeans

605
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,880
so what do you need to do this clothes

606
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,960
something to patch with be that fabric

607
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,120
or thread there are materials

608
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,080
and methods that are suitable to thread

609
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,679
only

610
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,080
you need a needle optionally you might

611
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,799
like an iron or a sewing machine

612
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,480
and you're gonna need a little time

613
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,279
iron-on patches sadly i don't have a

614
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,200
photo mostly because i could not find an

615
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,080
iron-on patch of the house

616
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,880
are the easiest method of doing this in

617
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,080
the modern world

618
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,679
just take some iron a little bit of time

619
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,279
just like your software you want to make

620
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,559
sure the patch covers the whole

621
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,679
vulnerability

622
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,360
whether that is an actual hole or

623
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,279
whether it's an area of fabric where

624
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,600
if you've ever fallen on concrete or

625
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,360
gravel and just

626
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,520
skinned the heck out of your knee and

627
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,960
noted that suddenly your

628
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,760
pants only have threads going one way

629
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,039
that's what i mean by fabric wear

630
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,760
take a little side note here fabric has

631
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,080
or

632
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,480
what i should say woven fabric has knits

633
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,600
are magic and i don't know much about

634
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,799
them

635
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,039
woven fabric has threads that go two

636
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,799
directions perpendicular

637
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,640
the warp threads go up and down they're

638
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,360
very tough the weft threads go side to

639
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,480
side they're a little less tough

640
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,679
if you've ever seen the thing where

641
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,279
somebody has a zillion threads across

642
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,559
the knee of their pants

643
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,760
that's the warp threads peeking out

644
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,679
you want to cover the whole thing if you

645
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,799
sew your patch to

646
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,960
just half the threads it will come off

647
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,720
iron on easiest most common cheapest way

648
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,360
to fix your hole

649
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,200
unfortunately it is also the least

650
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,440
durable because of the adhesive

651
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,960
adhesive comes off in the wash

652
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,559
eventually even

653
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,240
really nice fabric adhesives will do

654
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,480
this

655
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,960
or you can sew on it takes a needle

656
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,919
thread a patch and some time you want to

657
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,640
look at that black patch on the left

658
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,480
this is actually on the inside of a pair

659
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,880
of jeans

660
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,399
that line about making sure your patch

661
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,320
covers the whole repair this

662
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,399
area of fabric where on the right is

663
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,600
where the patch did not

664
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,640
quite cover the whole

665
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,760
worn spot and you can see this little

666
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,000
square stitch around it that's a machine

667
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,880
stitch

668
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,120
that's where i had to patch to cover the

669
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,039
existing patch

670
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,240
these are now garden jeans

671
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,320
this is still pretty straightforward if

672
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,840
you're putting a patch on a jacket

673
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,240
maybe you pin it in place first maybe

674
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,679
you walk around with it for a few days

675
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,039
see if you like it

676
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,000
and then you sew it on

677
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,520
it's fast it's easy it's durable it's

678
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,440
always going to be a visible repair

679
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,960
whether it's the stitching or whether

680
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,480
it's the patch itself

681
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,919
because you're going to cross to the

682
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,679
other side of the fabric and come back

683
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,760
in with your needle and thread

684
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,679
there are ways you can do that to make

685
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,279
it less visible but it's

686
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,440
pretty much always going to be visible

687
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,279
and if you're patching a particularly

688
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:31,760
piece

689
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,080
thick piece of denim it might take

690
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,559
pliers to force the needle through

691
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,918
don't worry about it just do it

692
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,520
we can also talk a little bit about

693
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,840
darning

694
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,720
this is the art of replacing thread so

695
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,399
when we're talking about those warp and

696
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,159
weft threads when the weft wears out you

697
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,600
can actually weave new

698
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,559
thread in there the easiest way to do it

699
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,840
is with a sewing machine

700
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,919
put your light fabric or your

701
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,240
interfacing on the inside

702
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,520
stitch up and down back and forth

703
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,159
i did that here with a zigzag i needn't

704
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:10,840
have done that

705
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,200
because generally use a zigzag on

706
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,039
stretch material

707
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,760
this ceased to stretch immediately

708
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,279
because i sewed it to non-stretch

709
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,760
material

710
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,880
you can't see me shrugging but i am you

711
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,480
want to stitch in line with the existing

712
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,799
threads until that worn area is covered

713
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,880
this is a pretty durable way of making a

714
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,399
repair and if you use

715
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,200
matching thread if i use dark blue

716
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,559
instead of black

717
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,120
and gone a little bit denser you can

718
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,840
hide it pretty well

719
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,200
this can be also time consuming and the

720
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,120
unfortunate part of machine darning is

721
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,200
that machine thread is just often not

722
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,840
very strong

723
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,000
there's a whole bunch of reasons for

724
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,880
that but uh

725
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,919
i'll spare you you can also hand darn

726
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,279
now this is a fairly floppy hand darn

727
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,279
honestly i did this in a hotel room with

728
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,120
a tiny little sewing kit that i got from

729
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,159
the front desk because they didn't have

730
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,200
an iron on patch

731
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,679
either it takes a lot of time

732
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,760
you want to hook your needle in where

733
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,880
the fabric is still

734
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,960
sound again make sure your patch covers

735
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,799
the whole vulnerability

736
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,399
do a few little stitches and then you

737
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,840
weave your needle in and out

738
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,600
i was going fast and loose because i

739
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,880
needed these pants to be ready

740
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,039
immediately i was helping somebody move

741
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,559
and i blew out my jeans

742
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,799
um

743
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,720
if you do a better job of this you can

744
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,559
go through and actually weave your

745
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,360
needle

746
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,679
in and out of that warp thread one

747
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,720
thread at a time

748
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,000
with matching thread that makes a repair

749
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,039
that is beautiful

750
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,520
and every bit as durable as the actual

751
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,360
fabric that you are replacing it with

752
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,320
your work

753
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,879
it also takes hours and hours

754
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,279
it can be totally invisible you can work

755
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,279
patterns in it if you're that good

756
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,559
you can replace fabric on

757
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,919
clothing from silk to wool to cotton to

758
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,760
synthetics

759
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,080
you can stitch holes shut and do this

760
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,919
you can put a patch on the back to

761
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:14,720
reinforce

762
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,000
and do this the only con

763
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,760
i can think of is that man this takes

764
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,158
some time

765
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,960
if you want to make a beautiful

766
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,640
functional repair

767
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,080
this is one of the best ways to do it

768
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,080
so i hope especially with the oh let's

769
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,080
all stay home now we can't go buy

770
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,480
fresh clothes and the ongoing crisis

771
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,919
of a lack of sustainability in society

772
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,480
at large

773
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,080
go out and patch something try it out

774
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,600
might be fun i think we have just a

775
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,000
few minutes left there any questions

776
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,519
here

777
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,159
absolutely um some more tongue in cheek

778
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,679
than others like do these patches

779
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,600
require a reboot or can we just restart

780
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,679
the service

781
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,000
i would recommend washing them um throw

782
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,919
the whole object in the wash

783
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,799
that might be a reboot uh but we do have

784
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,480
some um

785
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,880
some other intercepting proxies

786
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,679
questions

787
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,279
and one of them was what is it about

788
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,159
kerberos

789
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,279
that the others don't like

790
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,840
uh they just don't seem to support it

791
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,440
the kerberos negotiation

792
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,279
doesn't seem to be handled natively or

793
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:37,760
at

794
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,600
all in either burp or zap roxy

795
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,080
you could probably script it yourself or

796
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,519
you can set up a proxy chain

797
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,880
i know which one's faster for me

798
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,000
and another question was if you send a

799
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,200
request via burp

800
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,360
it will show the reply only in code

801
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,760
right no image

802
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,039
correct it won't show you images you can

803
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,600
sometimes click over to your sources

804
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,480
and see it there but there's not a good

805
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,159
way of

806
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,480
previewing an image in burp community

807
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,279
all right and is there a way to auto

808
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,240
deploy your patches

809
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,919
unfortunately no it's manual every time

810
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,200
i imagine that would be the iron on

811
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,279
patches right

812
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,559
as close as you could get if you've got

813
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,720
an obliging relative who likes to sew

814
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,880
maybe you can get them to help it's

815
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,840
still just outsourcing the work though

816
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,399
all right well i'm not seeing any new

817
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,039
questions

818
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,919
so thank you so very much for your time

819
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,919
um i would also like to thank everybody

820
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,440
that showed up to watch

821
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,640
uh all the organizers of course leslie

822
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,880
for organizing the entire event and

823
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,679
yeah there we go i think i don't know

824
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,640
how i'm supposed to end this

825
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,840
so i'm gonna

826
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,599
maybe that'll work hey perfect

827
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,159
no uh no curses for this mic

828
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,960
all right so with that that's the end of

829
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,800
the stream uh

830
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,399
thank you all for watching very much

831
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,639
that's ends of uh pancakes

832
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,800
20. uh i don't know if there will be a

833
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,599
20 uh 2021 but um

834
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,239
you know hopefully uh hopefully so uh

835
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,760
this has been a lot of fun to watch and

836
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,440
uh it all came together

837
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,440
really quickly so that was awesome um

838
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,918
if you uh like this kind of content i do

839
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:54,879
infosec stuff

840
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,920
as well more infrequently since rallysec

841
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,520
has stopped filming

842
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,240
but i
