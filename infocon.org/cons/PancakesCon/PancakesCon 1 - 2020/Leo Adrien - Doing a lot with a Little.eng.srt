1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
and it looks like leo is giving us a

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,880
talk titled

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,120
doing a lot with a little working in

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,280
austere windows environments and turning

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,960
simple ingredients into delicious

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,040
curries

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,639
an introduction to making the most of

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,239
things with limited resources

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,480
as hackers we are often asked to work in

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,920
restrictive environments

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,480
be it citrix only access to a server a

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,640
windows appliance in kiosk mode or a

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,960
network with no internet access

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,400
this portion of the talk will introduce

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,599
the audience to some of the more

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,840
interesting features built into windows

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,520
and how they can be used to help us hack

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,120
when our usual hacking tools aren't

19
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,160
available

20
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,079
from basics defined binary data with

21
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,559
certutil so it can be copied and pasted

22
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,280
as a text port scanning with powershell

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,200
to using printers and error messages to

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,680
escape

25
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,000
restricted guides this portion of the

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,280
talk will encourage everyone to think

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,800
creatively about what you can do with

28
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
the tools built into windows

29
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,399
this segment assumes a working

30
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,160
familiarity with the windows operating

31
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,160
system it does not assume or require

32
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,320
any knowledge of windows internals law

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,039
bins powershell etc

34
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,519
followed by an introduction to making

35
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,320
curries

36
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,119
out of almost anything this portion of

37
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,799
the talk will show the audience just how

38
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,439
easy it

39
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,560
can be to make curries at home focusing

40
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,159
on making healthy delicious meals with

41
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,240
only a few ingredients this presentation

42
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,840
will start with how to make the base for

43
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,960
any curry

44
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,119
it's just onions in some kind of curry

45
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,799
powder and then adding whatever meat

46
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,320
fish and or vegetables you happen to

47
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,960
have around

48
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,520
after a couple of walk-throughs slides

49
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,240
not live

50
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
will be shown a simple fish curry with

51
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,400
only six ingredients and a delicious

52
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,320
vegetable tree that can be made with

53
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,880
almost anything this portion of the talk

54
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,240
will give viewers the confidence to

55
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,920
spice up their homemade meals and

56
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,280
experiment with different ingredients

57
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,640
and recipes

58
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,479
this segment assumes a basic knowledge

59
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,960
of cooking such as making plain rice

60
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,520
chopping ingredients and operating a gas

61
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,799
or electric stove

62
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,240
it also assumes access to a

63
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,880
kitchen-based equipment and two onions

64
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,399
salt oil and some variety of curry

65
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,600
powder

66
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,960
so leo are you ready yeah absolutely

69
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,318
leo without any further delay for our

70
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,760
final talk of the day

71
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,160
on pancakes con track two

72
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,720
cool so hi everyone um yeah this is

73
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,000
doing a lot with a little

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,239
and uh hopefully you can learn some tips

75
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,080
and tricks for uh using windows and

76
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,920
making food

77
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,319
um so who am i uh my name's leo adrian

78
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,080
um i'm on twitter australia

79
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,680
and i'm a security consultant who does

80
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,040
pen testing and red teaming for a

81
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,640
company based out of sydney

82
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,480
um and at home i do sort of security

83
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,079
research and a lot of cooking

84
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,400
so what to expect as moonman said with

85
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,080
the introduction some tips and tricks

86
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,879
for working in

87
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,959
restrictive windows environments maybe

88
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,519
how to escape some lockdown guise

89
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,519
or how to navigate isolated networks

90
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,959
when you don't have the normal tools you

91
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,480
want to be using

92
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,319
and then also how to make some delicious

93
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,680
curries now that we're all stuck at home

94
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,560
for a while

95
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,159
and and what you might want to try and

96
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,000
get in the pantry so you can make them

97
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,319
okay so um why can't we just use our

98
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,200
elite hack tools

99
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,040
um when i started working as a pen

100
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,959
tester i just finished my oscp

101
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,599
i had this sweet customized kali box and

102
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,120
i thought i was some kind of metasploit

103
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
ninja

104
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,080
but i pretty quickly realized that on a

105
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,519
significant portion of the testing i was

106
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,080
doing

107
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,319
none of that really mattered um big

108
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,840
corporate environments are not designed

109
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,680
for plugging random computers into and

110
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,280
pressing hack

111
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,000
firewalls network segmentation vendor

112
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,720
appliances

113
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,040
business policy perhaps there's a lot of

114
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,799
reasons why maybe we can't just go in

115
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,480
there with all of our cool tools

116
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,760
that we've written or gotten off the

117
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,400
internet and start playing around

118
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,480
and so that's where it comes in handy to

119
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,159
have some tips and tricks

120
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,760
up your sleeve when you do need to

121
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,599
either get the job done or try and get

122
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,120
some connection back to your host or

123
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,280
the internet so you can get those tools

124
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,159
um

125
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,439
yeah working with what's there

126
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,080
um so guri restrictions um not as common

127
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,360
as network stuff but

128
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,280
i've seen a few around and especially

129
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,640
now if you're working through some kind

130
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,760
of virtual desktop

131
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,000
like maybe citrix you're often going to

132
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,439
be given an environment where you have

133
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,840
one app so to speak in windows so maybe

134
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,360
it's internet explorer

135
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
or some kind of mail client or a

136
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
document but

137
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,478
you're not given access to the whole

138
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,478
operating system and the other the other

139
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,918
time you'll see this is in some kind of

140
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,199
kiosk mode if you

141
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,320
get the opportunity to test those

142
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,880
they're a lot of fun so our goal here is

143
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,560
as a hacker or a tester or maybe just

144
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,400
someone who needs access

145
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,840
is to try and escape whatever

146
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,000
application we've been put in so that we

147
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,960
can actually start

148
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
using the tools on the operating system

149
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,560
or get a connection back to our machine

150
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,199
so explorer is pretty much god on

151
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,360
windows if you can get an explorer shell

152
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,199
you can you can generally do whatever

153
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,199
you want um the only exception to this

154
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,600
is uh in really new versions of windows

155
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,840
if the sandbox or the application is is

156
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
a windows universal

157
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,240
platform so windows store app there's

158
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,680
actually some really good sandboxing on

159
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,120
that microsoft does consider it a

160
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
security boundary

161
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,000
but i don't see that very often

162
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,280
generally vendors want to try and

163
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,720
reinvent the wheel they make their own

164
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,320
kind of kiosk

165
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
application and usually it's pretty easy

166
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,759
to escape if you can if you can get some

167
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,320
kind of explorer shell so in this case

168
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,080
just a really simple chrome in kiosk

169
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,600
mode and uh

170
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,080
there's no start menu there's no uh

171
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,639
there's no

172
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,479
tab at the bottom but if you right click

173
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,080
and go to print something then you can

174
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,600
click find printer and suddenly you've

175
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,199
got a gui you can do what you want

176
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,080
there's some other common ways if

177
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,600
perhaps you can't print or you don't

178
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
have right-click for save as and things

179
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,440
those are usually my first go to's if

180
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
you can get some kind of error message

181
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,919
up

182
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,639
that's always a good way i was on a test

183
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,919
for a kiosk once

184
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,759
it was reasonably well locked down so it

185
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,840
was just like a a web it's really simple

186
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,440
web page with some information

187
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,360
didn't have right click available

188
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,720
couldn't manage to print anything or

189
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,400
save or download anything

190
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,600
but the kiosk wasn't very well

191
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,800
physically secured and it turned out

192
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,319
that if you just unplug the ethernet

193
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,680
cable

194
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,759
when it tried to load the page it would

195
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,039
fail and

196
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,000
give you this error message and you just

197
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,039
click through

198
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,680
the uh the diagnostics dialog you get a

199
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,520
link to a cab file when you click that

200
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,400
it opens explorer so um just another way

201
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,600
to try and jump out

202
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,360
get into that explorer window one from

203
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,639
there try and get to

204
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,880
cmd.exe or whatever you if you want you

205
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,840
can run explorer

206
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,679
to open up a full gui if you want it

207
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
sticky keys is another really good one

208
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,240
that's common um especially in things

209
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,319
like citrix environments

210
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,639
you can usually get a sd keys prompt in

211
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,160
the citrix window by pressing

212
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,280
shift a few times um five times specific

213
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,479
that'll give you a link to the ease of

214
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,840
access center

215
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,000
and uh again that's going to give you an

216
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
explorer window

217
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,319
sometimes it's not that simple though so

218
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,080
for example maybe you do get an explorer

219
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,720
window but

220
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,479
you can't switch directories you can't

221
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,240
access the other applications on the

222
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,360
operating system

223
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,880
um and that's we might need to try

224
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,400
something a little bit more a little bit

225
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,599
more advanced a little bit more tricky

226
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,039
that hopefully the vendor hasn't thought

227
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,840
of

228
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,759
so there's a couple of a couple of

229
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,759
things i would try first so uh you can

230
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,720
actually give

231
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,680
explorer a cls id so that's a sort of

232
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,520
link to a com object that's been

233
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,680
registered in the windows registry

234
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,919
and you just put shell triple colon and

235
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,039
then a good

236
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,360
into the explorer bar and this

237
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,960
particular one launches the little run

238
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,919
prompt

239
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,120
but there's a number of them they can

240
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,080
you can use them to get to other

241
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,479
directories or launch programs but

242
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,720
it's a feature that isn't commonly known

243
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,319
about and can sometimes get you around

244
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:34,720
some

245
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,280
restrictions if you do have some kind of

246
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,759
network access to the host

247
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,759
you can try and visit a webdav server or

248
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,120
an ftp server with

249
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,360
just an explorer window and from there

250
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,039
hopefully you can you can run your tools

251
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:47,919
or copy tools

252
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,960
as needed and then finally um

253
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,560
really nice trick is just trying to

254
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
access something using a unc

255
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,800
path so a unc part starts with a double

256
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,400
slash and then a host name or an ip

257
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,520
address

258
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,039
as opposed to a dos path which starts

259
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,599
with a drive and then a

260
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,440
drive letter and then a colon backslash

261
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,000
so that one actually i i used to escape

262
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,560
this

263
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,199
the citrix environment i couldn't um use

264
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,879
a regular dos path but if i

265
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,360
try to visit the windows or system32

266
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,960
through a localhost's path

267
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,120
then i can access no problem and i can

268
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,840
actually get a command prompt to run

269
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,080
there

270
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,759
what if what if command prompt itself is

271
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,520
blocked um that is the case sometimes

272
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,360
again especially with kiosks or

273
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,799
some some of the more locked down citrix

274
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,120
environments um you can try copying

275
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,799
renaming it that's a pretty common one

276
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,320
um usually they'll do some kind of

277
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
blacklist so things like powershell and

278
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,479
cmd.exe won't be able to start

279
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,679
but if you can get a copy of that and

280
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,760
rename it that'll work pretty well

281
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,279
if you can't move directories at all so

282
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,600
maybe even with localhost

283
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,519
if you can get some kind of notepad

284
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,200
document open so either you get in a

285
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,880
directory that has a text file like the

286
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,560
cab one i showed earlier

287
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,279
um or you're able to to get a right

288
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,000
click and open with notepad on something

289
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,760
and if you can open a new notepad window

290
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,519
you can hopefully just save a

291
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,440
save a bat file to the directory you do

292
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,959
have access to something like

293
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,720
what i've shown here and what this will

294
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
do is it'll uh it'll copy command prompt

295
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,160
over and rename it

296
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,600
and so hopefully even if you can't

297
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
access command prompt itself

298
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,120
i've generally found that when you run

299
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,560
batch scripts and things like that it

300
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,920
automatically just bypasses those

301
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,959
restrictions

302
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,240
and then it gives you the access you

303
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,720
need um hopefully in a directory again

304
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,360
that you have access to um so that's a

305
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,240
few ways to just

306
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,360
try and get around these good

307
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,600
restrictions if you uh do

308
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,440
encounter something like that in in a

309
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,959
citrix environment

310
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,040
appliances as well are pretty common if

311
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,160
they're based on windows

312
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,040
for example iot edition but networks

313
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,560
restrictions especially now that we're

314
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,160
all working remotely

315
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
you may have to virtual desktop or rdp

316
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,519
into something

317
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,880
um you may be going into an environment

318
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,000
that doesn't have internet access if

319
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,600
you're going through a vpn

320
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,880
it doesn't have direct internet access

321
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,800
back out if you're going through a vpn

322
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
um and so this is pretty common in big

323
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
enterprise environments especially for

324
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,440
hosts that are in some kind of

325
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
segregated subnet like a management or a

326
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,720
security subnet

327
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,160
and it may even be on the other side of

328
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
that citrix box that we just escaped

329
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,560
into

330
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,240
um so we want to get some kind of

331
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,560
connectivity to to a host that's in this

332
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,000
in this space so we can move tools over

333
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,839
for pen testing maybe we want to get

334
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,120
some files back for some kind of

335
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,560
analysis

336
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,880
here's some tricks and ways to do that

337
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,240
um obviously the

338
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,399
easy wins are going to be the you do

339
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,240
have some kind of direct access back to

340
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,399
yourself maybe if you vpn then you are

341
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,640
you're now on that same local network

342
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,079
windows has a ton of good clients for

343
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,360
stuff like that

344
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,519
it has ssh now by default on newer

345
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,040
versions of windows 10 which is really

346
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,680
cool and it has things like scp included

347
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,640
so that makes it really easy also rdp

348
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,839
has copy paste which

349
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
most people know about but it also has a

350
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,079
way to mount drives so you can mount

351
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,040
your local

352
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,720
c drive or maybe you've got a share or

353
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,079
something

354
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,760
across the rdp connection and that's a

355
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,200
really easy way to say share

356
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,839
a folder full of tools with um

357
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,200
target server that you're trying to test

358
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,279
or trying to access but that's that's

359
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,480
the easy mode that's why i've actually

360
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,360
got something uh

361
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,000
something correct um if you do only have

362
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
citrix access for example like a citrix

363
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,040
rdp

364
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,079
um xxx usually has a copy paste for

365
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,880
text if not if not binary files so cert

366
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,760
util is a really cool tool on windows

367
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,079
you give it a file and an out file and

368
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,279
it'll base 60 for it

369
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,399
and you can then just open up that

370
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,320
base64 file

371
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,880
and copy copy the base64 text and then

372
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,440
paste it back into a file on your host

373
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,200
and uh and recombine it or do the

374
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,399
opposite if again if you want to move

375
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,079
some kind of binary tool over

376
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,440
um this is really good if say you want

377
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,360
to uh you know dump lsas or something on

378
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,720
the target with

379
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
the task manager window you've got this

380
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,839
lsat dump

381
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,600
you want to run that through mimikats

382
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,279
you can just encode it bring it out of

383
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,279
the environment over citrix and then

384
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,800
give it to your local copy of mimikatz

385
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,200
for passing and get those hashes out

386
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
netsh is another really cool one does

387
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,440
require admin access but

388
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,000
lets you uh board ports on windows just

389
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,519
from the command line

390
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,959
so you just need to give it a listening

391
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,560
address and a listening port

392
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,480
and then you can give it a port to

393
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,399
redirect that that connection too so

394
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,079
that'll be really nice if uh

395
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,760
say you have some kind of command line

396
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,360
access maybe to an environment

397
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
um as an admin but you want rdp access

398
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,560
and there's some kind of firewall or

399
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
gateway blocking that connection

400
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,920
well you can use whatever ports you do

401
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,000
have access to and then

402
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,480
redirect connections on those to rdp on

403
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,279
the local host

404
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,800
and that way you sort of get a gui back

405
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,320
through the for whatever connection you

406
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,120
have available to you

407
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,399
byo code is a big one now on modern

408
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,600
versions of windows

409
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,920
so everything these days ships with net

410
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,279
and that means powershell and that means

411
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,120
c sharp

412
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,639
so powershell is a really really

413
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,839
powerful excuse me scripting language

414
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,839
and c is a really great compiled

415
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,440
language both of them are really well

416
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,240
documented on the microsoft website

417
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,760
so c-sharp you can actually just write a

418
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,760
notepad and then and compile it with the

419
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,959
csc compiler

420
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,480
on windows the little file

421
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,800
file name in red there or folder name is

422
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
the version so if you find you perhaps

423
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,079
running on a slightly older version of

424
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,920
windows you may have to use a

425
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,320
version 3.5 or three but it should have

426
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,079
the cse compiler

427
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,680
and if you really have to uh do

428
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,800
something in a pinch and you can't get

429
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,920
internet access you

430
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,360
can't find a way to get your tools onto

431
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,600
this box um you can always just

432
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,440
just write your own stuff and that's a

433
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,560
that's a nice trick

434
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,399
um there are some powershell one-liners

435
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,920
i use pretty commonly um

436
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,600
umbreonsec gave a really nice talk on

437
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
this earlier so i definitely recommend

438
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,560
checking that out hopefully the

439
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,360
recording will be up soon um but just

440
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,160
the ability to

441
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,720
test if if a port is open is uh really

442
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,600
helpful

443
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,320
um we often rely on nmap and things like

444
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,839
that on a linux host

445
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,120
but if you're on a windows host you have

446
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,880
any way to access that

447
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,120
um then test net connection is very

448
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,079
useful it's

449
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,240
only available on windows 10 and 2016

450
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,880
powershell as far as i'm aware

451
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,320
but it's very very useful and you can

452
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,920
throw that in a loop if you want to

453
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,760
just be aware it does take about five

454
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
seconds um to finish scanning a single

455
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,320
port

456
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,240
regardless of whether it's open or not

457
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,160
um so if you try to throw this in a huge

458
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,880
loop and

459
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
hit every tcp port it's going to take a

460
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,480
really long time you're probably better

461
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,040
off

462
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,480
trying to try to build some little

463
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,920
c-sharp application or something that

464
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,320
can

465
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,160
do some multi-threading and do that a

466
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,680
bit more efficiently

467
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,600
invoke web request is great probably

468
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,440
seen this one if you've done some ctfs

469
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,279
or any kind of offensive security

470
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,079
a really good little one-liner just to

471
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:28,720
connect

472
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,160
over http or https to a web server and

473
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,920
pull down a file

474
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,560
you can also send post requests with it

475
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,040
again if you wanted to say cert util

476
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,760
some kind of file or data binary data

477
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,760
and then provide it as a post request

478
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,120
you could you could try and upload if

479
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,920
you had a

480
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,959
http server that could accept that

481
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,959
and then we have the uh the windows

482
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,000
admins grep

483
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,920
which isn't quite as nice but generally

484
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,519
does the trick so

485
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,279
that's just using get child item which

486
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,279
is kind of just a directory listing

487
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,040
you just give it a path and an extension

488
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,480
and and recurse means it'll just

489
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,320
recursively look through all the folders

490
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
uh in that path um and then you're

491
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,480
piping that to select string which uh

492
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,399
which just reads all the strings out of

493
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,240
whatever whatever it's been given

494
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,440
and looks for a pattern

495
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,279
so just uh summing up some of these

496
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,199
tricks like as infosec

497
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,120
workers we often faced with restrictive

498
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,680
or compartmentalized environments

499
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,040
sometimes it's our job to break out of

500
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,399
them sometimes we need to break out of

501
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,360
them in order to just

502
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,279
do our job and especially if you're

503
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,399
working remotely you're

504
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,839
probably going to find you have a few

505
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,360
more groups you have to jump through

506
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,720
before you can connect to the targets

507
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,560
that you want

508
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,240
if you're asked to test a windows kiosk

509
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,160
or appliance um enjoy it

510
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,440
it's a lot of fun to be had at poking

511
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,040
some kind of gui application until it

512
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,800
can give you a shell or

513
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,959
some kind of operating system access and

514
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,040
generally vendors don't do a fantastic

515
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,160
job of

516
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,519
locking that stuff down windows isn't

517
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,600
really designed most of the time

518
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,240
to be used in that kind of way um aside

519
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,800
from those

520
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,639
universal windows platform apps that i

521
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,320
described it's not really a security

522
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,440
boundary to just have an internet

523
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,880
explorer in full screen

524
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,079
um and so there's usually some fun

525
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,360
tricks you can find out

526
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,720
yeah windows has a lot of built-in

527
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,160
features so if you need to do something

528
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,519
simple as there's probably a tool

529
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,880
already on the box

530
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,800
or in a pinch you can write one yourself

531
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,959
using using the languages available

532
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,560
and i highly recommend checking out the

533
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,480
the lol bass project

534
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,680
if you're interested in a sort of

535
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,600
semi-complete list of what binaries ship

536
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,560
with windows

537
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,480
and some very cool ways to use them and

538
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
that website documents um

539
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,320
what each kind of binary will will do in

540
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,519
terms of if you want to get code

541
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,279
execution or you want to download

542
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,040
some kind of file or you want to copy a

543
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,600
file that's super helpful and

544
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,279
it also goes into things like app locker

545
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,720
which i'm not really going to cover but

546
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,040
is

547
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,320
another kind of restriction that you

548
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,680
might might see in some kind of

549
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,839
corporate environment

550
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,839
okay so uh moving on to curries

551
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,920
um honestly this is a this is a really

552
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,399
big question um and not something i'm

553
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,560
in a super good position to answer uh

554
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,000
curry is a catch-all

555
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,240
term that refers to a huge range of

556
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,079
dishes from multiple continents and

557
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,679
nations

558
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,839
um as an australian i've eaten dishes

559
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,959
labeled curry in

560
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,679
indian thai malaysian lincoln afghan

561
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,559
ethiopian

562
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,559
japanese mauritian and a whole lot of

563
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,000
other restaurants

564
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,760
the curries i cook at home and which i'm

565
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,520
going to show you are probably

566
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,839
most similar to sort of indian cuisine

567
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,199
but i'm not really in a definition to

568
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,000
define what

569
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,520
curry is or isn't for for another

570
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,600
culture but definitely what i'm talking

571
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,160
about

572
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,840
of what curry is this is what's

573
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,760
influencing me um

574
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,520
and hopefully the principles that i talk

575
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,880
about will sort of uh

576
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,039
guide you well into making arrows from

577
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,640
from some other kind of

578
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,400
that's what you're interested in so

579
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,480
what uh what do i mean by curry and why

580
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,240
is it so so damn delicious

581
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,000
so some kind of complex flavors from a

582
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,520
spice mix um

583
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,360
usually a little bit of heat from chilis

584
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
or chili powder

585
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,280
it has a graveyard sauce which carries

586
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,400
the above and

587
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,960
soaks into meat vegetables rice whatever

588
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,000
you want to serve it with

589
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,559
which which makes it extra delicious the

590
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,120
spice mix is really at the heart of it

591
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
if you fry spices in oil especially with

592
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,039
onion you get magic

593
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,640
so uh that's what we're looking for and

594
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,320
that's what i really encourage you to

595
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,559
play around with and then the sauce is

596
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,160
uh usually thickened with something

597
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
coconut milk or maybe a tenor tomato or

598
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,520
some yogurt or cream

599
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,280
and uh this will carry those those

600
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,600
delicious flavors really really well

601
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,240
okay so making curry at home there's

602
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,000
four core ingredients again this is just

603
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,600
just the way i see it and as someone who

604
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,200
cooks quite a lot

605
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,280
onions ideally yellow but you can

606
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,880
definitely use red probably use

607
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
maybe less onions if using red because

608
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,640
they're a little bit sweeter

609
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,799
some kind of neutral oil so by that i

610
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,679
just mean something that isn't really

611
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,039
strongly flavored so

612
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,280
olive oil peanut oil sesame oil all

613
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,320
those are going to have a pretty strong

614
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,200
flavor

615
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,799
and we want something really really

616
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,799
neutral and mild so that our

617
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,160
curry powder and spices can really carry

618
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,720
the flavor

619
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,480
salt makes everything delicious so

620
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
especially if you're used to eating out

621
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,720
a lot and

622
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
not cooking at home as much perhaps you

623
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,799
don't use uh the fresh unprocessed

624
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,080
ingredients very often

625
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,320
um add more salt i promise you're not

626
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,520
going to go over your limit and

627
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,960
it makes everything delicious but don't

628
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,400
don't be afraid to add a couple of

629
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,440
pinches

630
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,600
um and then the curry powder is uh

631
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,559
probably the bit where it gets the

632
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,280
trickiest

633
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,760
to provide recipes and they'll tell you

634
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,799
exactly how to do things because it's

635
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,760
really going to depend on what you've

636
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,480
got available

637
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,360
um you can make them yourself but i

638
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,320
usually just buy

639
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,840
buy a good one from the store i've tried

640
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,440
a bunch and i've got some that i like

641
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,960
i'd recommend trying to find something

642
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,640
that uh that looks good to you and i'd

643
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,760
definitely recommend starting with a

644
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,960
mild one

645
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,320
you start with a mild curry powder

646
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,240
you're in a lot of control in terms of

647
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
how hot you want to make things and uh

648
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,360
and that

649
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,120
i think is just a better experience and

650
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,039
then you can add more chili or

651
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,240
add more yogurt or something you need to

652
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,000
cool it down definitely better than

653
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,200
trying to make some delicious meal and

654
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,919
then you get to the end

655
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,720
it's too hot to eat

656
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,799
okay so what's in a typical curry paste

657
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,640
or a powder

658
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
some mix of spices usually toasted and

659
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
then ground into a powder

660
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,720
um so commonly found in pre-made curry

661
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,400
powder um these these kind of things

662
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,559
coriander and cumin especially uh

663
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,240
by far the most common in the powders

664
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,000
that i use and i thought

665
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,280
usually the first two ingredients on the

666
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,600
packet but everything else on there is

667
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,559
is on that list is pretty common and um

668
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,480
if you do want to do things like uh

669
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,400
you know introducing new flavors or

670
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,480
maybe experimenting with spices

671
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,240
i definitely recommend just getting a

672
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,400
nice mild curry powder that you like

673
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,919
and then just add a little bit of extra

674
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,080
of one of these and see what flavors

675
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,799
come out and

676
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,440
what kind of things you like and chili

677
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,880
powder is usually included by default so

678
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,840
as i said

679
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,600
watch out for that and and try not to

680
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,720
get something that's too hot to start

681
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,120
with

682
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,559
you can always add more more chili

683
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,400
powder later if you decide you like it

684
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,720
hotter

685
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,039
so creating a curry in in four parts um

686
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,720
so cook chopped onion in a generous

687
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
amount of oil on a on a low medium heat

688
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,480
until it's golden brown

689
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,240
this is really where the sort of the

690
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,679
flavor and the sauce base comes from

691
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,840
just cooking it really low and slow not

692
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,120
not letting it burn not letting it get

693
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,679
too dark

694
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,679
just just a nice golden brown it usually

695
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,039
takes somewhere between

696
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,880
20 to 30 minutes you can you can let it

697
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,159
go really far if you want to get it

698
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,919
really really brown and crispy

699
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,360
but that's a really good base to start

700
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,039
with um

701
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,039
adding curry powder this and as i said

702
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,200
once you add curry powder to hot oil

703
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,559
and let it fry up for a couple of

704
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,799
minutes um magic happens

705
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,159
this is when the really amazing smell

706
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,080
starts to come through your kitchen

707
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,520
starts to fill with curious people from

708
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,880
the rest of the household asking what's

709
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,600
going on

710
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,000
this is the good stuff then you're

711
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,760
adding some kind of liquid for the sauce

712
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,960
so thin tomato is a nice bit of acidity

713
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,280
and

714
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,440
uh not too overpowering coconut milk is

715
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,720
really nice and creamy

716
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,159
yogurt again is a bit of acidity but

717
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,080
also creamy and uh if you're trying to

718
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,280
make something like a butter chicken

719
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,480
then uh you're probably going to be

720
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,200
using

721
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,039
proper whole cream which is pretty

722
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,640
decadent but it can be really delicious

723
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,600
and then and then

724
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,840
vegetables you have available you want

725
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,080
to do this with a mine to what takes the

726
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,760
longest to cook

727
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,840
so things like potato sweet potato

728
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,039
pumpkin eggplant take a really long time

729
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,640
potato especially you might be looking

730
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,280
at sort of 50 minutes to an hour

731
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,200
you definitely want to add that earlier

732
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,559
and then things like meat

733
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,600
chicken green beans capsicums or

734
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,039
peppers okra it really depends on

735
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,960
on exactly how big you've cut everything

736
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,159
and what you're looking at

737
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,840
but probably looking at more like a 20

738
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,360
to 40 minute cook time there depending

739
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,640
on what it is

740
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,559
some cuts of meat if you're using like a

741
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,159
piece of chuck steak that's got a lot of

742
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,520
connective tissue or something

743
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,880
might even want a little bit longer just

744
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,960
so you can like a really slow nice slow

745
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,400
cook and let all the fat render out of

746
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,520
it

747
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,919
and then things like fish spinach peas

748
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,360
maybe kale

749
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,720
cook really quickly so you'll want to be

750
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,039
adding them sort of towards the end

751
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,480
if you're going into a curry and you

752
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,760
haven't got a recipe you're just sort of

753
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,440
doing it ad hoc

754
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,720
as long as you have these things in the

755
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,000
back of your mind and you're adding

756
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,200
ingredients roughly

757
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,520
roughly this order you can't really go

758
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,120
too wrong

759
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,679
okay so a super simple six ingredient

760
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,799
fish curry

761
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,320
um so three brown onions uh about 500

762
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,400
grams or a bit over a pound of

763
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
some kind of mild white fish it can be

764
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,520
frozen i often just buy

765
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,159
packs of whatever whatever frozen fish

766
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,840
fillets are available

767
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,360
and then just defrost them before use

768
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,840
obviously and then a tin of coconut milk

769
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,480
some curry powder oil salt it's really

770
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,080
that simple

771
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,400
so step one is to uh to chop the onions

772
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,280
and cry a lot

773
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,400
um yeah there's no real way to avoid

774
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,919
this uh you can wear goggles if you want

775
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:44,799
it's not very cool

776
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,840
but um yeah you should get used to it

777
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,039
after a while

778
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,600
um so yeah chop the onions carefully uh

779
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
with most of the stuff i'm

780
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,960
presenting here the size doesn't really

781
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,679
matter especially for the onions you can

782
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,360
chop them you can dice them and slice

783
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,120
them um they're going to be cooked for a

784
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,720
pretty long time so the main thing is

785
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,679
that they're not

786
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,480
too big and uh and then just put them in

787
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,440
the oil and they'll

788
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,200
they're good to go so you add the onion

789
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,240
and a pinch of salt

790
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,720
cook it for 25 to 30 minutes until it's

791
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,760
nice and golden brown

792
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,919
and stir every five minutes or so you

793
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,520
don't have to be in the kitchen 24 7.

794
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,960
um but you just want to make sure things

795
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,799
aren't sticking and the pan isn't

796
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,679
getting too hot

797
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,600
don't be afraid to turn it down and or

798
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,960
even take it off the burner for a minute

799
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,840
if you think that's happening

800
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,279
so step four i might have skipped a step

801
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,559
there um

802
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,000
after the spices are fried for about

803
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,919
three to four minutes uh add the fish

804
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,520
and uh mix it thoroughly until it's

805
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,679
coated in that lovely spiced oops

806
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,679
okay so that's the bit i've skipped step

807
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,919
three add some curry powder obviously

808
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,360
so this is where you'll probably want to

809
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
add about a teaspoon a tablespoon sorry

810
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,640
to a tablespoon and a half of curry

811
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,000
powder and just stir it through

812
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,880
let it fry for two to three minutes and

813
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,520
then

814
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
add the fish and you've got this nice

815
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,440
lovely spiced oil that you're covering

816
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,240
it with

817
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,400
and add about half a cup of water after

818
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
it's had a couple of minutes to fry

819
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,679
and just scrape the bottom of the pan to

820
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,200
make sure nothing's sticking once you

821
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,480
add the curry powder

822
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,720
to the oil and the onions it generally

823
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,919
tends to stick on the bottom a little

824
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:12,480
bit so

825
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,000
give it a few minutes to fry up but then

826
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,200
don't be afraid to start adding some

827
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,760
liquid

828
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,960
and make sure nothing's burning or

829
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,679
getting too stuck

830
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,360
so after about 8-10 minutes the fish

831
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,000
should be breaking apart a little bit

832
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,039
this is when you'll want to start adding

833
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,400
the coconut milk and just stir that

834
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,200
through

835
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,360
um it'll make it really nice and creamy

836
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,720
and it's fine if the fish isn't

837
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,520
completely

838
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,799
cooked through or broken apart because

839
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,679
we're going to cook it for a little

840
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:36,880
while still with the

841
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,760
with the coconut milk

842
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,760
and then cook for another five to ten

843
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,520
minutes or so once the fish is really

844
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,840
broken down into into nice little pieces

845
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,480
um it's ready to serve so uh i generally

846
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,520
serve things with hot

847
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,080
hot rice freshly made and some kind of

848
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,440
salad if possible but you could also

849
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,200
make it with say naan bread or something

850
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,080
like that

851
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,000
or a piece of toast even in a pinch

852
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,440
that's all you've got available

853
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
it's very flexible and you don't have to

854
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,240
be too traditional about it

855
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,840
but a simple salad so these are what i

856
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,760
serve with most of the curries

857
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,840
you just need some kind of a nice fresh

858
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,679
vegetable so i usually use cucumber or

859
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,039
carrot or tomato

860
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,880
and some kind of oil this could be olive

861
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,080
oil

862
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,840
salt and pepper some kind of lemon or

863
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,120
lime juice

864
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,279
or vinegar some kind of acid and then if

865
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,640
you if you really like heat you can add

866
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,360
some fresh chili to this as well

867
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
so it's pretty uh pretty simple as it

868
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,559
says on the tin just

869
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,880
grate the carrot grate or really thinly

870
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,120
slice the cucumber like i've done here

871
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,919
or dice the tomato mix the oil salt

872
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,360
pepper and whatever the acid you're

873
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,200
using is

874
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,279
probably like half a half a lime or a

875
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,720
lemon is fine for this

876
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,039
and a couple of tablespoons of vinegar

877
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,520
if that's what you're using

878
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,960
and then just pour this mixture over the

879
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,120
over the vegetable and uh and mix it mix

880
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,679
it through

881
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,559
and uh just a really nice refreshing um

882
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,000
sort of taste and texture

883
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,760
go alongside something really really

884
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,840
rich and hot and spicy like a curry

885
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,360
um yeah so there's uh you can do with

886
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,480
carrots as well that's

887
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,919
generally what ends up looking like and

888
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,240
um yeah just a nice textural and

889
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,919
and uh label contrast

890
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,679
okay so a simple potato curry um

891
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,720
so again two to three onions the

892
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,440
the amounts here are really variable

893
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,880
because this is uh this is kind of like

894
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,320
the base i use

895
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
anything i pretty much always add potato

896
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,440
because i like potato

897
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,919
and who doesn't and it goes really well

898
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,279
in these kind of things it does mean it

899
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,320
takes a while to cook

900
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,080
but then you can really add whatever

901
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,360
else you want

902
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,440
again just looking back at that um that

903
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,799
chart roughly how long

904
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,600
things things take to cook so that'll

905
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,960
also depend on how much you're adding so

906
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,360
if you're

907
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,799
using a lot of potato or something it's

908
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,720
going to take a little while longer

909
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,159
and especially if you're cutting into

910
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,080
bigger pieces but

911
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,320
once we've got the potato add some kind

912
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,159
of meat or chicken or eggplant whatever

913
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,520
you've got around whatever you like to

914
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,399
eat

915
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,159
again some curry powder and this time i

916
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,840
i'm going to be using some uh

917
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,240
some tomato just a tin of crushed or

918
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,520
diced tomato

919
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,279
um and some more optional things you can

920
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,120
add to curries like garlic and ginger

921
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,080
are always great

922
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,840
if you're able to get fresh or if you've

923
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,159
got a jar of it in the fridge is fine

924
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,600
and then some kind of extra veggies if

925
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,440
you like something green maybe

926
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
green beans or peas or okra i'm going to

927
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,559
use okra and

928
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,960
some yellow peppers or capsicum here and

929
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,120
then i'm also going to use some

930
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,960
cumin seeds like i said right at the

931
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,399
beginning uh

932
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,080
if you do find that you like some

933
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,840
particular spices more than others or

934
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,960
perhaps you just like that

935
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,120
flavor combination um for example i

936
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,960
really like cumin with potatoes and with

937
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,600
eggplant

938
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,120
i'm going to add a little bit extra here

939
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,480
and in this case i'm going to use whole

940
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,960
seeds rather than a powder

941
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,159
and if you are worried about things

942
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,919
being too hot always just have some

943
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,840
unsweetened yogurt on hand

944
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,480
and you can add that to dampen down the

945
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,120
chili effect

946
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,279
um yeah so this is what i'm what i'm

947
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,440
using in the example so just eggplant

948
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,960
some peppers um oil

949
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,159
uh the one thing i uh

950
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,360
yeah i would say here is you don't feel

951
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,640
like you need the the ginger and the

952
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,760
garlic um it does

953
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,840
add extra a little bit of flavor but if

954
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,360
you've really just got onions and

955
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,520
maybe some chicken and some pepper in

956
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,640
the house or something that's

957
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,880
that's plenty um the main thing is it's

958
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,399
just you're just making this

959
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,080
the space with the onions and the spices

960
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,240
and then uh whatever you can add to that

961
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,559
to make a delicious and hearty meal is

962
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,960
gonna work

963
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,679
um so put about again six tablespoons of

964
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,799
oil in a big pot

965
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,880
low heat just like we did last time um

966
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,399
add the onion and salt

967
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,919
so uh yep very similar 20 to 30 minutes

968
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,320
maybe have a little bit less time for

969
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,840
this one because we are going to be

970
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,399
adding some potato and letting it cook a

971
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,679
little bit longer

972
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,720
but again you're just trying to make

973
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,919
sure things don't stick too much

974
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,679
um so while that's well that's going

975
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,520
just prepare all your other ingredients

976
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,840
um like i said i try to chop potato and

977
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,600
uh and things like that sweet potato

978
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,120
maybe your pumpkin pretty small because

979
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,640
i know it's going to cook

980
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
pretty slowly eggplant here i've made a

981
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,840
little bit bigger

982
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,679
just because i know the pump the potato

983
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,880
is going to take a bit longer

984
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,200
so i know that it doesn't really matter

985
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,240
if eggplant takes a little longer

986
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,279
because it's still going to be waiting

987
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,720
on that potato to cook

988
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,279
and then the peppers and the okra i know

989
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,360
think about about the same time

990
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,399
so i'm just going to put them in a bowl

991
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,679
together because it's easy to toss them

992
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,240
all at once

993
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,919
so the amount of curry powder you use

994
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,279
really depends on how much other stuff

995
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,480
you're adding and how strong you like

996
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,760
your curry

997
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,159
over this one because the uh ingredients

998
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,240
list was a little bit more flexible

999
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,600
it's really up to your discretion how

1000
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,039
much you want to add either on the side

1001
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,399
of caution if you perhaps

1002
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,960
don't like super strong flavors or

1003
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,080
worried about things being a little bit

1004
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,360
too hot

1005
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,880
but for this amount one and a half to

1006
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,640
two tablespoons of curry powder is

1007
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
generally good um if you are adding

1008
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,320
extra things like cumin seeds

1009
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,919
um i'd probably add them first and fry

1010
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,760
them for a minute so it's just cumin

1011
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,080
seeds in the oil and onion

1012
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,440
and then add the garlic and ginger and

1013
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,640
fry it for another minute just to get

1014
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,080
those flavors uh going

1015
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,039
and to get let those uh let those spices

1016
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,960
dry up really nicely before you add

1017
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,519
everything else um and then again fry

1018
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,080
the

1019
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,440
curry powder for a couple of minutes and

1020
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,840
scrape the pan as you need to

1021
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,600
and here add add some water again don't

1022
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,200
be afraid to add water if things are

1023
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,559
looking a little bit sticky or drying up

1024
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,000
a little bit

1025
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,799
and add a tin of tomatoes um the tomato

1026
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,799
sauce i find is uh is really

1027
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,600
really versatile um it's really easy to

1028
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,399
add that to

1029
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,480
whatever you have on hand be it you know

1030
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,320
meat chicken um fish

1031
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,240
and it goes really well with everything

1032
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,080
um so that's a good staple

1033
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,679
and uh hopefully everyone stocked up on

1034
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,880
some thin tomatoes recently

1035
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,880
um if you have some stock or stock

1036
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,399
powder now is also a good time to add it

1037
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,679
so you don't have to use water as a

1038
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:48,480
liquid

1039
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,080
um yeah if you've got some homemade

1040
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,039
chicken stock or something that's

1041
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,640
fantastic or even just a stock cube

1042
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,760
works really well and

1043
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,360
this gives the sauce an extra sort of

1044
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,840
richness

1045
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,600
and this curry sauce is uh is going to

1046
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,279
be the base so this is

1047
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,720
what it looks like it should be smelling

1048
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,559
really good at this point and from here

1049
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,799
you can pretty much do anything

1050
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,919
i'm going to give this keep going with

1051
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,600
this example where i'm using eggplant

1052
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,360
and okra and stuff

1053
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,960
but if you did just have some some

1054
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,559
chicken breasts you diced

1055
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,760
you could just throw those in there they

1056
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,440
wouldn't take that long to cook at all

1057
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:17,840
um

1058
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,000
probably 15 minutes with chicken and a

1059
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,919
few few other softer vegetables

1060
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,200
okay so i'm going to be adding the uh

1061
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,360
the potato and stirring it through so

1062
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,799
it's coated in the sauce and then

1063
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,799
cooking that for about 15 minutes or so

1064
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,320
again that's because i know that potato

1065
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,760
takes takes much longer than the other

1066
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,200
stuff so i just want to give it a nice

1067
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,399
head start

1068
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,679
then i'm adding an eggplant or if you

1069
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,519
were using say some kind of red meat

1070
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,679
probably at it then again it's going to

1071
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:44,960
depend a little bit on

1072
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,360
what the cut is like that so um use your

1073
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,559
discretion and definitely don't be

1074
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,159
afraid to taste as you go

1075
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,200
um obviously you don't want to be

1076
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,600
tasting or trying big pieces of raw meat

1077
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,399
but um

1078
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,919
yeah don't be afraid to have a little uh

1079
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,440
little sip of the sauce and see if maybe

1080
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,279
needs a bit more salt a bit more water

1081
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,640
maybe it's a little bit hot as i said

1082
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,200
again you can always add yogurt to that

1083
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,720
which will mellow things down and makes

1084
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,519
a really nice sauce

1085
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,720
so yeah after about 15 minutes at the

1086
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,840
meat or the eggplant

1087
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,519
and then uh in this case i'm waiting

1088
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,960
another 30 minutes before i add the

1089
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,320
softer vegetables

1090
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,519
just because i know that they're going

1091
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,440
to cook a lot quicker and the eggplant

1092
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,960
potato are going to beneath the bulk of

1093
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,840
the time

1094
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,360
um stir everything through as you add it

1095
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,039
and uh add more water if the sauce is

1096
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,880
getting too dry

1097
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,960
so here uh on the left it's a nice

1098
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,240
looking sauce it sort of

1099
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,480
covers most of the potatoes um they're

1100
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,760
gonna cook really well in that but once

1101
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,360
i added the eggplant i realized it

1102
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,399
wasn't quite enough

1103
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,679
liquid so that's where i'm going to be

1104
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,960
adding a little bit of water i don't

1105
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,559
want to cover everything and make a soup

1106
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,840
but you want to be simmering pretty

1107
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,360
nicely and have everything everything

1108
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,720
just covered so that it can

1109
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,960
cook

1110
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,919
and then yeah so get the whole pot to a

1111
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,120
gentle simmer and

1112
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,200
cook first for 30 to 40 minutes on a

1113
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,159
medium heat

1114
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,519
um the curry is ready whenever the

1115
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,200
vegetables and meat if you're using it

1116
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,559
to cook through and tender so

1117
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,480
keep testing with a fork and keep

1118
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,960
tasting you can also do this in the oven

1119
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,440
you sort of set it to about 180 or 350

1120
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,399
fahrenheit

1121
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,599
you can put the pot in there with a lid

1122
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,960
it's great if you've got a dutch oven

1123
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,159
like i do

1124
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,879
but otherwise you can you can just use a

1125
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,679
um

1126
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,000
a pot on the stove or a big fry pan even

1127
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,679
depending on how much you have

1128
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,719
you just got to stir a little bit more

1129
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,000
if you're going to use the uh you're

1130
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,199
going to use the stove top and

1131
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,320
make sure things aren't sticking and

1132
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,440
you've got enough liquid in there

1133
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,040
so this is what it looks like when it

1134
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,960
comes out reduced a little bit

1135
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,399
everything is nice and soft and

1136
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,639
all those flavors are nice and melded in

1137
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,159
get these nice pools of

1138
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,839
spiced oil you can see on top as well

1139
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,280
which is extra delicious and

1140
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,359
hopefully going to flavor our rice or or

1141
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,719
breads or whatever we serve this with

1142
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,040
and again trying to serve it with a with

1143
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,159
a

1144
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,040
salad if possible and fresh rice or some

1145
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,839
plain yogurt

1146
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,399
it's always a really nice accompaniment

1147
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,679
especially if you have people perhaps

1148
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,320
over who

1149
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,240
different levels of spice tolerance

1150
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,160
mixing some yogurt through is a really

1151
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,200
easy way to

1152
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,399
take that heat down a notch

1153
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,079
okay so yeah summing up um yeah cars can

1154
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,000
be as simple or as complex as you want

1155
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,240
so my examples hopefully are just a

1156
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,520
jumping off point they're not a rule

1157
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,079
book

1158
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,680
i'm not a professional chef or an expert

1159
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,599
but i do really like cooking

1160
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,040
there are some awesome recipes out there

1161
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,480
if you uh if you like to be a bit more

1162
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,680
adventurous

1163
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,040
i would definitely recommend trying to

1164
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,640
make urine curry powder at some point it

1165
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,960
does take a bit of time and patience

1166
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,480
and there's some great recipes out there

1167
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,680
and you'll need you'll need some kind of

1168
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,560
grinder

1169
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,839
um but don't be afraid to just start

1170
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,280
with a with a basic curry powder and

1171
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,920
then add

1172
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,160
add a spice or two as you see fit um and

1173
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,440
just see what the flavors are that come

1174
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,040
out and you'll pretty quickly find

1175
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,880
things that you like more or less of or

1176
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,560
perhaps what goes with what kind of

1177
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,680
kind of meat or vegetables

1178
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,839
use whatever fresh ingredients you have

1179
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,040
so that's that's one of the good things

1180
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,079
about this

1181
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,599
with the environment we're currently in

1182
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,079
you may not have access to everything

1183
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,520
but curry goes pretty well with most

1184
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,920
vegetables and meat so you know whatever

1185
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,119
you can get your hands on and if it's

1186
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,320
frozen things like

1187
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,040
frozen onions or peas green beans

1188
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,160
whatever it may be

1189
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,200
you should still be able to make a

1190
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,280
really delicious meal just if you do use

1191
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,400
things like frozen onions they might

1192
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,359
need to cook a little longer because

1193
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,400
there's going to be a lot of moisture in

1194
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,040
there

1195
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,160
and you'll want to get that out so they

1196
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,359
get nice nice and golden and brown

1197
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,839
and uh yeah you have access to whole

1198
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:20,880
spices they're

1199
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,160
another great one and don't forget the

1200
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,560
salads as well i think it always makes a

1201
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,240
really nice touch i always

1202
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,599
or usually get some pretty good

1203
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,280
compliments if i'm serving some kind of

1204
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,920
salad

1205
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,000
just takes the meal to another level and

1206
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,599
provides a nice bit of

1207
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,760
refreshment from the intensity of the

1208
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,400
rest of the dish

1209
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,359
um yeah so thank you all for listening

1210
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,720

1211

00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,680
yeah i was just looking at the question

1220
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,440
list and it looks like no one actually

1221
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,720
has any questions

1222
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,960
here they're mostly just talking in the

1223
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,960
slack about how they all want to make

1224
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,880
curry right now

1225
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,359
i would highly recommend that yeah it is

1226
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,000
uh it's

1227
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,520
uh pretty early in the morning in

1228
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,119
australia right now but uh honestly i'm

1229
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,720
thinking about it

1230
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,839
here we go here's a couple uh do you

1231
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,119
recommend the sides

1232
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,880
well yes he just said that he recommends

1233
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,160
a side cell of a curry

1234
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,680
that's a question uh someone else is

1235
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,760
asking for rice recipes but honestly

1236
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,400
that's just

1237
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,040
rice water and a little salt mostly yeah

1238
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,680
honestly

1239
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,880
there's a few little things you can do

1240
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,040
to spice it up so um often maligned

1241
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,640
bailey

1242
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,320
yeah garlic's good if you throw a couple

1243
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,240
of bay leaves in the in the water that

1244
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,839
you're boiling the rice in

1245
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,200
that goes really well you just get a

1246
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,599
nice fragrance coming out of it

1247
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,440
especially if using basmati rice i

1248
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,200
actually like or i prefer to boil it in

1249
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,359
a pan or a pot sorry rather than using a

1250
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:53,760
um

1251
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,599
a rice cooker or some bay leaves in

1252
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,320
there maybe some some cardamom pods

1253
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,800
yeah so i just mentioned cardamom yeah

1254
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,160
it's fantastic

1255
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,359
some really great biryani and pilau

1256
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,599
recipes out there it's a little well

1257
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,200
it's a lot more complex

1258
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,320
but there are some there's some

1259
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,079
fantastic sort of spiced rice dishes

1260
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,839
where the rice really is at the

1261
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,280
heart of it and you sort of cook cook

1262
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,760
the rice with spices or as part of the

1263
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,280
curry or you layer the curry on top of

1264
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,480
the rice and then bake it

1265
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,680
but there's definitely some cool stuff

1266
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,200
you can do up there if you want to take

1267
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,480
the next level

1268
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,839
that's where amazing curry is

1269
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,599
you're good oh nope i'm done

1270
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,320
oh okay uh yeah and someone else is

1271
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,960
asking

1272
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,480
when to add chickpeas

1273
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,640
uh actually that's another good recipe

1274
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,560
um if you if you google uh new york

1275
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,680
times

1276
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,320
chickpea and pumpkin recipe chickpea

1277
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,359
pumpkin curry

1278
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,000
sorry um they've got a fantastic recipe

1279
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,560
um i

1280
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,000
the chickpeas generally don't take that

1281
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,440
long to cook i think they have them in

1282
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,240
for maybe

1283
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,079
15-20 minutes but that's a fantastic

1284
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,440
recipe i've actually used it a bunch of

1285
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,800
times before

1286
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,680
so yeah new york times for chickpea and

1287
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,040
pumpkin is is a great one

1288
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,359
and uh yeah they generally don't take

1289
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,320
too long um

1290
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,520
if i was adding it to something like

1291
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
this i'd probably add it um

1292
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,680
around the same time as the okra and the

1293
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,160
uh and the peppers

1294
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,000
yeah especially if they're canned or

1295
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,280
already cooked uh they

1296
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,280
really don't take exactly yeah they're

1297
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,560
gonna they're gonna be really soft um

1298
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,160
they do go really well with coconut milk

1299
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,200
as well maybe not

1300
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,560
with the fish one but if you wanted to

1301
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,200
say a set of fish you want to do chicken

1302
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,599
with the coconut milk one and add it to

1303
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,960
the chickpeas or something that'd be

1304
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,480
delicious and uh they'd probably

1305
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,920
take about the same time to cook maybe

1306
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,160
you could add the yeah the chickpeas a

1307
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,880
little later

1308
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,560
yeah that's another fantastic ingredient

1309
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,920
and again something you can you can

1310
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,200
usually get canned that lasts a long

1311
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,720
time

1312
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,800
indeed yeah just make sure for the

1313
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,400
canned ones that you drain them

1314
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,119
thoroughly

1315
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,200
because the effect otherwise is

1316
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,119
unpleasant in the extreme

1317
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,640
yeah someone else is they're gone

1318
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,560
someone else is recommending red lentils

1319
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,880
chickpeas and spinach

1320
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,720
yeah yeah spinach is a spinach is a

1321
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,240
great one and again really easy to just

1322
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,599
stir through at the last minute cooks

1323
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,040
really quickly

1324
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,200
lentils are fantastic um i wish i could

1325
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,160
have done a whole other

1326
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,720
presentation on dal dal is really simple

1327
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,319
starts very similar so

1328
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,720
frying onions and some spices and then

1329
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,160
cooking some lentils separately

1330
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,000
and then usually just drain drain the

1331
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,359
lentils once they're once they're well

1332
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,000
and cooked

1333
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,359
or if the moisture is cooked out of them

1334
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,880
then just stir that spice mixture

1335
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,240
through the lentils and it's just like a

1336
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,839
really nice hearty

1337
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,280
lentil stew essentially that you end up

1338
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,960
with so definitely check out some dal

1339
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,560

1340
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,040
um

1341
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,480
really can't recommend that enough and

1342
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,400
again lentils are something that keep

1343
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,280
really well and

1344
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,680
you know maybe a less less commonly

1345
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,280
taken off the shelves as a

1346
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,880
first impulse buy so hopefully you can

1347
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880

1348
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,560
