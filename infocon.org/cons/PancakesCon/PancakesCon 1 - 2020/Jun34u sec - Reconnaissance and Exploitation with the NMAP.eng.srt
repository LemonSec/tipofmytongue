1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:17,920
and you should be a presenter now juno

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:31,439
and you're muted right now as well

3
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,559
hello can you guys hear me um yeah

4
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,640
we can hear you and see your slides

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,320
awesome

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,800
let me find my webcam and then it should

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,839
be all set up

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,000
all right can you guys see me um it's

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,360
not important it's not super important

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,000
for this section but it is for the next

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,280
everything looks great awesome hello

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,120
i'm juno or junostec on twitter um

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,039
uh most of you guys probably know me

14
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,360
from the dallas infosec scene i run

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,560
dc214 dallas's defcon group

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,040
um as well as i presented at the lo at

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,479
the local b-sides

18
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,600
and at uh dallas hackers association

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,520
but uh before i actually moved to dallas

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,040
in august of 2018

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,720
from alaska um i when i was in alaska i

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,159
went to college studying computer

23
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,600
science and economics

24
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,200
it was in college when i got interested

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,119
in cyber security i

26
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,759
started competing in ctfs in my free

27
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,000
time i breathe fire and also play music

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,360
which i'll be talking about

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,200
in a sec all right um

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,720
so first my first topic is

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,479
reconnaissance and exploitation with the

32
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,399
nmap scripting engine

33
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,799
i first became familiar with the nmap

34
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,479
scripting engine

35
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,799
when i uh when i during my first

36
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,600
internship

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,200
on a red team i'd used mmap before in

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,840
ctfs just sort of to scan things

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,520
and find out with what they were but

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,439
this really expands the functionality

41
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,200
and it's relatively

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,840
easy and understandable to use now i'm

43
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,840
going to try to do a live demo here

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,520
instead of a oops instead of instead of

45
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,319
slides

46
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,879
but if that doesn't if that doesn't work

47
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,000
out

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,760
i do have i do have slides for you so

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,280
here i have a cali vm

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,360
and a metasploitable vm if you're not

51
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,480
familiar with what they are

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,400
metasploitable is just

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,599
a uh is just a in an

54
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,720
instance that's um that's very insecure

55
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,360
and beacon

56
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,239
and can be used for practice exploits

57
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:40,640
and

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,760
cali is every

59
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,000
everybody's favorite uh the hacking

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,160
hacking os especially for beginners i

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,239
know someone out there is

62
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,160
is going to come in and say no you

63
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,000
self-compile arch or nothing and

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,040
this is the beginner talk so

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,400
here um here you can see uh

66
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,239
here you can see my terminal so i'm just

67
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,480
going to start by making sure

68
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,040
i can talk to my metasploitable vm

69
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,840
uh the ip has not changed so

70
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,239
one two one six eight

71
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,200
if it's at all possible could we get the

72
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,120
fonts to get larger so that people on

73
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,040
the presentation can see a little easier

74
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,360
let me see um that is a very good

75
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,760
question

76
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,560
if anyone knows how to zoom please chime

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
in

78
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
uh

79
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,040
[Music]

80
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,360
[Music]

81
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
this is

82
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,918
it's three preferences

83
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,000
i'm not sure how hard is it uh how hard

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
is it to see

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,120
somebody's saying that if you hit

86
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,639
control plus plus it might do it

87
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,960
probably not

88
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,639
well let me try it on also try under

89
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,040
view

90
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,360
they're saying oh cool

91
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,759
thank you comments aha thank you comment

92
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,080
section

93
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,440
all right does that i can even

94
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,800
that should be absolutely wonderful

95
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,880
thank you awesome

96
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,919
cool thank you for that what is my iv

97
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,039
there so

98
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,440
if you're unfamiliar with ifconfig i can

99
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,280
see the address of my metasploitable vm

100
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,000
192.168.56 101.

101
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,680
[Music]

102
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,039
then i'm just going to ping it to make

103
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,479
sure it's still there because when i was

104
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,160
practicing this demo

105
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,080
um i had accidentally just i had

106
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,440
accidentally i was actually doing

107
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
everything to the wrong

108
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,199
ip and was very confused as to why

109
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,120
nothing was working all right so now

110
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,479
that we know that's there i'm going to

111
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,479
start by just running a basic and

112
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,080
knapped skin against against my vm to

113
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,800
see what's

114
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,840
to see what's there and i'm using the

115
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,759
verbose flag just so i can see every

116
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:53,840
step that it's taking

117
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,680
and so what this is doing for the

118
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,240
uninitiated is

119
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,560
uh is it's running a ping scan where it

120
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,600
attempts to ping

121
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,319
all uh which is the most common ports at

122
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,840
that ip address

123
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
and as it goes through there you can see

124
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,440
it discovering a bunch of different open

125
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,840
ports

126
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,759
and there will be provided up

127
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,800
and so here now we can see

128
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
a bunch of a bunch of different of the

129
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,039
different ports that are open

130
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,039
and the services running on them and so

131
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,120
that's uh that starts to give us a good

132
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,319
idea uh

133
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,840
that's what will start to give us a good

134
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,560
idea of what to look for

135
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,800
yeah um in in terms of vulnerabilities

136
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,160
so next i'm actually going to use um one

137
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,639
of the

138
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,080
one of the most i don't know

139
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,520
i'm going to take that i'm going to take

140
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,919
that a step further by

141
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,160
running a service version scan which

142
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,919
will do the same thing but show the

143
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,960
version if it thinks that each of these

144
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,479
services is running and from that

145
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,000
version we can start to look at

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,560
actually uh the individual exploits that

147
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,759
might be available

148
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,120
for each uh for each of those things now

149
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,479
this is going to take a

150
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,039
second to run um so if anyone has any

151
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,880
questions while things are running uh

152
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,039
please just shout them out to me

153
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,039
and i'll start to answer them while we

154
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
wait

155
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,720
we don't have anything in q a just yet

156
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,240
but if you're checking slack there might

157
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,639
be some

158
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,840
oh boy i don't have that i don't have

159
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,960
that up but this is

160
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,520
the uh this is the track for you then oh

161
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,400
awesome thank you

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,680
but while this runs a little bit a

163
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,520
little bit more about what it's actually

164
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,199
trying to do

165
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,440
is it's trying it's trying to it's

166
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,080
trying to oh there we go

167
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,280
but it's trying to uh make that uh make

168
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,039
uh complete the entire connection

169
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,639
and i start to fingerprint what it

170
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,520
actually is so

171
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,720
here here we see the port

172
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
um whether it's open or closed the

173
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,160
service and then the particular version

174
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,039
it's running

175
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,199
now in sort of a regular beginning pen

176
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,400
test what i then do

177
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,960
is start plugging all these versions

178
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,199
into something like exploit db

179
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,440
to determine which uh like metasploit

180
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,399
modulation

181
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,360
i should use but we can actually uh we

182
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,240
can actually can

183
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,599
sort of continue along this path

184
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,880
uh we can actually continue along this

185
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,039
path with

186
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,519
the uh start by starting to use the nmap

187
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,560
scripting engine

188
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,720
so we can see up here that this is

189
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,959
running ssh

190
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,440
um for those who aren't familiar ssh a

191
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,279
lot allows you

192
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,000
to log into the log into the terminal of

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,040
a different device

194
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,880
from your own um

195
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,440
and one of the or one of the most uh one

196
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,480
of the most

197
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,760
prevalent map scripting engine tools is

198
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,959
something that will attempt to brute

199
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,880
force the credentials for

200
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,320
ssh so first uh to start let's figure

201
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,959
out where

202
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,519
actually the nse scripts are which we

203
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,959
can run them without knowing where they

204
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,800
are this will help us out later

205
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,320
once we try to make our own

206
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,120
so just using locate command

207
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,680
it's going to pull up all of these

208
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,560
scripts

209
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,279
in uh user share and map scripts and

210
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,880
we can scroll through and there's a lot

211
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,560
so we're going to want

212
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,200
uh we're gonna we're going to want to

213
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,040
dial that back a little bit i'm actually

214
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,800
going to search for just particularly

215
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,399
the ones to do with ssh

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,360
and this brings this gives us this gives

217
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,839
us a

218
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,160
smaller amount to start to deal with um

219
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,920
so the one we're looking for right here

220
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,480
is the

221
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,320
ssh group script and that's the one

222
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,680
that will that's the that's the script

223
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,360
that's already built into the scripting

224
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,959
engine that will attempt to brute force

225
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,239
ssh authentication

226
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,079
so start it uh by starting to run it

227
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:24,670
oops

228
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,000
[Music]

229
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,240
oh boy what did i knock over oh that's

230
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,399
fine i need that for later

231
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,399
you can't see my desk but i have a pile

232
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,000
of like i have a baseball and a bunch of

233
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,720
other things and

234
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,079
it's all very precarious so

235
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,680
we're going to run uh nmap and then

236
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,399
we're going to

237
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,120
look at port 22 which is the port that

238
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,320
ssh is running on

239
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
and pull a script and that's going to be

240
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,959
ssh

241
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,210
root and

242
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,839
[Music]

243
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,680
now what this is doing here is this is

244
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,839
running it without any settings this is

245
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,600
using the default uh the default

246
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,440
dictionary

247
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,760
and it's going to attempt a a dictionary

248
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,640
attack against

249
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,160
ssh so as we run it

250
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,519
we can see it's trying different

251
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,920
username password combinations based on

252
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,880
the dictionary

253
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,959
root root admin admin administrator

254
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,800
administrator

255
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
and then it starts going through route

256
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,560
one two three four five six

257
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,920
now i'm not going to let this actually

258
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,839
run forever because i know

259
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,880
i know the credentials for um i know the

260
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,000
credentials for

261
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,279
medicine format is floatable um and

262
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,800
we don't need to sit here well for 20

263
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,200
minutes while it attempts to guess it

264
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,959
so i'm going to stop this right here and

265
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,720
i'm going to actually run this with a

266
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,360
custom dictionary a custom dictionary

267
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,639
that i built earlier

268
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,959
so just to show you what's in my custom

269
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,000
dictionary

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
if you're unfamiliar with metasploitable

271
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,320
the admin credentials are msf admin msf

272
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,920
admin

273
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,279
so i'm going to make i'm going to make

274
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,680
just a

275
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,160
list here we show root admin juno and

276
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,360
msf admin

277
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,040
you can use these custom dictionaries

278
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,720
say you've downloaded something like

279
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,839
rockview

280
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,279
that that has a a bigger

281
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,279
a bigger list of passwords people have

282
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,360
actually used or if you have a

283
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,279
list of passwords that you believe that

284
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,079
user is more likely to use

285
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,639
so and in case you

286
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,000
want to see i also have the same thing

287
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,800
in passwords

288
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,279
root admin juno msf admin

289
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,959
uh all right so now that i have that i'm

290
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:49,760
going to run it

291
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,079
i'm going to run let me hold the same

292
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,680
command and show you how i

293
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,079
show you how i change it so it's still

294
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,760
it's still going to be on

295
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,800
22 for ssh and still going to be

296
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,480
the same script um

297
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,639
but we're going to add script arguments

298
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,399
oops script hyphen args

299
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,040
this really just tests my ability to

300
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,079
type

301
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,240
i think my elementary school type typing

302
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,839
teacher would not be proud

303
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,200
and so we're setting the user database

304
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,920
to

305
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,240
usernames.list and password

306
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,360
and the password db

307
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,279
to passwords that list

308
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,800
and we're leaving the ip address the

309
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,040
same

310
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,600
and so this is going to run you see it

311
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,120
comparing the

312
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,160
comparing what i put in

313
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,399
and so now here at the bottom uh we

314
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,560
we see it's up and for the account msf

315
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,440
admin and msf admin is valid credentials

316
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,560
so we've performed uh we've performed a

317
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,320
successful

318
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,079
uh brute force attack against

319
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,440
metasploitable

320
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,240
and in case we want to double check we

321
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,839
can now

322
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
ssh

323
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,020
in

324
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,519
[Music]

325
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,760
type in an msf admin and here we are

326
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,079
um

327
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,560
all right so so the uh one of the

328
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,040
one of the coolest things about the nmap

329
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,760
scripting engine i think is its user

330
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,279
is its user community and and so

331
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,680
in addition to uh in addition to the

332
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,480
scripts that already exist in the nmap

333
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,440
scripting engine

334
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,800
there are a lot of people who have

335
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,240
posted things they've built out on

336
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,440
github

337
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,839
and uh we're actually going to look at a

338
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,480
full-on vulnerability scanner

339
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,519
uh called vulners that that uh uh that

340
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,519
user created and i'll have

341
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,959
i'll have uh i'll have the github link

342
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,600
and uh how to how to cl uh where to

343
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,360
clone and how to clone the github

344
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,760
uh how to clone that repository in my

345
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,440
presentation later if you want to look

346
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
at it

347
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,040
um but so i'm just going to show i'm

348
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,759
just going to

349
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,920
show you how to run a full vulnerability

350
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,839
scan against

351
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,000
against my system using just the

352
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,839
scripting engine

353
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,759
so we've got a script and since i

354
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,440
already downloaded

355
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,920
this into the correct area it still runs

356
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,079
like one of the scripts

357
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,759
it's called nmap vulners

358
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,920
and for most of these scripts you need

359
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,680
you need to have the service version

360
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,800
flag on

361
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,560
because most everything runs off of

362
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,680
the runs off of the service

363
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,880
the version of what's running there

364
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,279
without that it wouldn't actually see

365
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,240
the uh see

366
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
that which services were running and the

367
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,880
version in order to determine what cves

368
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,240
correlate with them

369
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
[Music]

370
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,199
oh i can't type

371
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,600
let's try that um actually spelling and

372
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,399
map correctly

373
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,120
and now we let it run and so this one's

374
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,959
uh this one's going uh this isn't going

375
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,160
to take a second

376
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
but essentially what it's doing is it's

377
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,360
running a service version scan

378
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,000
against my metasploitable vm and then uh

379
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,720
and then comparing those versions to i

380
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
believe this uses exploit db

381
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,199
to see what cves align with those

382
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,519
versions

383
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,079
of those those versions of the software

384
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,359
running

385
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,198
on that um

386
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,199
actually what i can do to speed this up

387
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,720
a bit is i'm going to have it run

388
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,280
against

389
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,039
specific ports that we already know are

390
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,720
open because we actually already did

391
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,520
this

392
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,400
reconnaissance earlier so port let's see

393
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,799
i know we had 21 22

394
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,039
23 25

395
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,600
53. i should just pull up

396
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,760
my list let me pull up my list of what

397
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,720
ports were actually open

398
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,210
80s a good one to look at

399
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,400
[Music]

400
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,840
and so this will just show us a few of

401
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,010
them

402
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,299
[Music]

403
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,880
well that didn't like what i did 20

404
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,840
commas

405
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,880
[Music]

406
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,200
i'll just i'll just run the whole thing

407
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,960
sometimes my live demos don't like me

408
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,000
always the risk you run right

409
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,320
oh yeah well while that loads i do

410
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,960
actually have

411
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,880
i do actually have the results or what

412
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,480
uh what the results of that begin to

413
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,120
look like

414
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,399
up so

415
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,840
let me throw that up here real fast

416
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,799
um

417
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,280
so this is what uh this is this is what

418
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,000
it starts

419
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,280
this is what it starts to look like so

420
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,120
we can see on port

421
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,240
21 um the version of ftp that's running

422
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,600
on it

423
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,360
uh what type of ssh is running

424
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,440
and then all the vulnerabilities that

425
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
are associated with that

426
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,799
with that version and we can see the

427
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,559
we can see the same thing here and this

428
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,960
has the cde number and then

429
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,600
even how to access the cve on their own

430
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,080
website

431
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,000
so so this uh the cool thing about

432
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,559
vulners is this is a script created by

433
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,480
just someone who uh this is and i ha

434
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,440
i have his name in my in my city in my

435
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,720
citations which i'll

436
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,120
which i'll give out for due credit but

437
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
this is uh this was a script created by

438
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,720
a community member

439
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,600
so i'm going to start to break down what

440
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,000
goes

441
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,080
what goes into what goes into a

442
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,120
nsc script so that so that you

443
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,280
uh so that you can potentially go write

444
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,720
one of your own

445
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,039
so the uh and this is so these are

446
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,880
written in lua

447
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,240
um if anyone's uh familiar with lua i

448
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,280
was

449
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,600
not super familiar with lua until i

450
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,039
started researching this

451
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,840
um a few days ago and

452
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,159
it's it's not uh it's not

453
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,280
it's not that painful it's to pick up um

454
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,039
if you can code in python you can

455
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,120
definitely figure lua out

456
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,720
um so this so this is a this is a

457
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,520
script to find the owner of an open tcp

458
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,200
port by querying the

459
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,200
uh the authentication server

460
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,640
and so the head of the script has

461
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,559
has the meta information

462
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,799
uh with the descriptions category of

463
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,840
dependencies

464
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,520
now because the script is relatively

465
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,080
simple i actually don't have um our

466
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,679
the author actually doesn't have

467
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,919
arguments and usage in there but this is

468
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,840
where that would go

469
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,919
but this output description here shows

470
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,880
what the output will be

471
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,520
and

472
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,640
next is the rule and this just decides

473
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,799
whether or not it's even possible to

474
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,159
run the script it's uh so this is

475
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,960
usually based on the type of rule

476
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,880
and the host import information passed

477
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,159
to it

478
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,840
um in the case of this script it's a

479
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,840
little bit complicated to decide whether

480
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,000
to run the identification script against

481
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,919
a given port in the first place

482
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,679
we need to know if there's even an

483
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,280
authentication server running

484
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,919
on that target machine so it should run

485
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,039
only if the

486
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,440
currently scanned tcp port is actually

487
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,320
open

488
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,880
um and if port 113 where the auth server

489
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,679
usually is is also open

490
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,120
um so

491
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,440
unfortunate uh one limitation of the

492
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,320
scripting engine is that it only gives

493
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,360
information about the current

494
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,679
port so we're actually going uh

495
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,360
so if i we find the local off port

496
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,120
and and then use the nmap get port state

497
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,320
function

498
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,360
um if the if this port was never

499
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,480
scanned then it'll return null

500
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,280
and so we'll then check to see if it's

501
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,000
in that

502
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,840
if it's in that table if it's null then

503
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,480
then we we skip this action this or then

504
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,000
we skip and don't run the rest of the

505
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,280
script but if it is there

506
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,360
we can continue to run the script

507
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,080
um and then the action is the major

508
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,799
functionality of the script um and here

509
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,960
it first connects to the port

510
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,360
where we expect to find the uh

511
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,520
identification server

512
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,200
and then we'll connect the port that we

513
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
want information about that being

514
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,880
113. and so

515
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,799
in order to do this it's going to create

516
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,039
two socket options by calling um

517
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,039
and map new socket and then so here and

518
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:17,760
then

519
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
for uh for this and for this entire

520
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,080
thing we actually we just have a

521
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,600
try accept um error handle error

522
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,760
error handling catch function um so that

523
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,039
it'll close

524
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,159
if fail right here if failure is

525
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,360
detected

526
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,440
um and so then at this point we can

527
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,799
start

528
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,120
start uh we'll start to call connect to

529
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,480
actually attempt to make

530
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,840
connections um using the object methods

531
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,279
um and then we have uh and then we

532
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,039
actually wrap the entire thing in

533
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,520
a try call which will turn our entire

534
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,960
thing into a catch function

535
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,240
if something goes wrong

536
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,320
and so i believe that's uh yes so that's

537
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,080
the majority on reconnaissance and

538
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,760
exploitation with the

539
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,360
nmap scripting engine i'm going to

540
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,720
minimize this oops and see if this is

541
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,000
still running uh do you have any

542
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,520
questions about

543
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,440
this portion of the evening or should we

544
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,279
talk about music

545
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,520
oh there we go um go ahead

546
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,360
someone was asking if you would use the

547
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,720
dash capital a flag

548
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,559
or would that miss important information

549
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,678
that sv would show

550
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,279
um honestly i i'm not sure because i

551
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,840
i've i've always thought of capital a as

552
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,880
a combination of

553
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,080
sv and o which shows the os so i

554
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,919
want to say that i want to say that it

555
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,360
would work

556
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,720
um for this one way to find out

557
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,120
um unless it packages the information

558
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,279
differently um

559
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,520
i'll let i'll let this run in the

560
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,880
background and we can always come back

561
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,840
to it

562
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,360
later uh are there any other questions

563
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,120
about

564
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,520
yeah somebody somebody wondered if you'd

565
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,960
written your own custom

566
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,159
scripts before i do not have one that is

567
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,120
working i

568
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,440
that i've written myself i've modified

569
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,320
ones uh

570
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,559
the one that i uh the one that i've

571
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,440
showed you the

572
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,640
uh the the one the one that i showed you

573
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
that finds the owner of the open tcp

574
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,320
port uh that's not one that i've written

575
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,080
but i've modified them

576
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,799
um i stay i

577
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,520
for a lot of it i've changed like for

578
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,360
example the ssh

579
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
brute force one i have one that i've

580
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,919
modified to add

581
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,559
uh to add time changes in between

582
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,440
attempts

583
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,760
just to see if i could um but i have not

584
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,240
yet written one from scratch

585
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,080
oh so yes this works with uh dash a flag

586
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,320
cool

587
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,799
somebody has an out there left field

588
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,840
question

589
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,640
i study as undergrad and i want to get

590
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,720
into infosec i seem to catch a hint that

591
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,640
you are also an economist do you have

592
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,559
any pointers

593
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,960
um oh boy uh so well i actually got into

594
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,360
speaking in infosec and then got moved

595
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,080
from my like

596
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,279
very like step-by-step data job to a

597
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,000
job as a like real blue teamer in part

598
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,919
because i started speaking

599
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,000
at cons and this is actually sort of my

600
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,960
first technical

601
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,880
talk because every other talk i've given

602
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,360
has actually been on economics

603
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,080
my big focus of interest is on game

604
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,200
theory

605
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
um and behavioral economics and using

606
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,120
that to apply to social engineering

607
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,520
scenarios or even computer scenarios has

608
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,640
helped a lot um so i think and

609
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,240
if you're really passionate about

610
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,679
economics

611
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,799
as well as infosec um finding

612
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,799
what you think is really really exciting

613
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,000
and then telling

614
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,039
anyone who will listen about it

615
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,960
raise your hand if i've come up to you

616
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,120
at a con especially in the after party

617
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,640
and started like drawing graphs and

618
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,159
waving them in your face i know there's

619
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,120
a few of you out there

620
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,240
um i hope that i hope that helped

621
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,919
and i'm not seeing any new questions so

622
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,159
we can go ahead and move on to the music

623
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,279
portion

624
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,480
all right um this is

625
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,039
so my one of my one of my many hobbies

626
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,000
as i mentioned

627
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,919
is as a musician and when i was thinking

628
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,279
about what to do i thought you know it

629
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,799
kind of like

630
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,720
i could i could get up and

631
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,320
and you know play the violin but that

632
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,559
doesn't really teach

633
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,880
that doesn't really teach anything new

634
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,720
um so i'm actually going to talk about

635
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,120
the

636
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,200
a little bit of the physics behind sound

637
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,480
and how

638
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
how we can take you know a vibrating

639
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,159
string and amplify it

640
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,480
amplify it and turn it into a stringed

641
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,520
instrument

642
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,200
um and as a part of this there will

643
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,600
definitely be demos um i think you can

644
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,360
see my bass behind me

645
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,559
uh so

646
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,640
first we're going to start by what is

647
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,279
sound how do you actually produce a tone

648
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,240
because noise is essentially a very

649
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,520
jumbled around

650
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,799
sound wave um because

651
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,960
uh uh noise is

652
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,720
there's nothing you uh there's nothing

653
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,799
really uniform about the wave for just

654
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,799
noise

655
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,919
but a tone is very very regular with uh

656
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,440
waves the same size and

657
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,799
distance apart and uh in order to

658
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,640
generate a tone you need to prevent

659
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,960
waves from bouncing back and forth and

660
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,880
cancelling each other out and by doing

661
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,399
that uh

662
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,960
we are with that a tone is actually a

663
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,559
standing wave which we'll get to in a

664
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,200
second

665
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,520
um i don't know how well you can see

666
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,960
this but i'm gonna go with it

667
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,080
this is just a rubber band that i cut

668
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,600
um and so you can start to see how this

669
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,199
vibrates and

670
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,840
you can probably hear it a little bit it

671
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,360
creates just a very very basic tone

672
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,960
well uh and that's because a string or

673
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,440
a straight a string length thing that's

674
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,360
uh contained on either end start creates

675
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,360
a the perfect container for a standing

676
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,640
wave

677
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,559
and so a little bit about how a standing

678
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,399
wave works is

679
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,880
on the string we have antinodes which

680
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,240
are the parts

681
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,440
that which are the parts that move

682
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,840
up and down the most and nodes which are

683
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,080
the spots in the middle where

684
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,120
where the wave uh where the wave doesn't

685
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,559
move at all

686
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,120
and that top string is the perfect as i

687
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,480
said the perfect container for the

688
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,919
standing wave

689
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,000
and you can see at the bottom we have

690
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,559
like this is just the whole

691
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,720
the whole string vibrating the nodes are

692
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,480
just where my finger is

693
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,880
and one thing uh by actually playing

694
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,200
uh harmonics we can create halfs thirds

695
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,480
and fourths

696
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,840
and those uh essentially what the

697
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,760
harmonic does and i'll demonstrate in a

698
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,159
second

699
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,279
is forces forces a node

700
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,480
and that plays different

701
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,360
different uh tones along with the same

702
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,159
same tone

703
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,799
um along the off octave but you actually

704
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,480
hear when you hear a note but they blend

705
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,399
in and they give it its resonance or

706
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,039
tim timber uh and i'm gonna take my

707
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,720
headphones off real fast

708
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,740
and grab my base and demonstrate a

709
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,789
[Music]

710
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
harmonic

711
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,559
[Music]

712
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
so

713
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,720
all right so uh this is my big denali

714
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
named after the mountain and so when i

715
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,240
play the e string

716
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,200
um and the way if you're curious a bow

717
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,279
creates sound

718
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,080
uh this if i pluck the bass it vibrates

719
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,120
the string

720
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,039
um and a bow just provides continuous

721
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:27,880
vibration

722
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,200
[Music]

723
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,519
so uh the harmonic on the bass there's a

724
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,279
harmonic about here

725
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,080
which instead of pressing instead of

726
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,679
pressing the string down

727
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,080
to create a note i uh

728
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,799
hold on let me put my headphones back on

729
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,360
real fast

730
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,120
uh you can't and you can see the the

731
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,840
bass correct

732
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,760
yes we can see it just fine okay cool uh

733
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,910
so do you hear the difference here

734
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,679
[Music]

735
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,440
uh with that uh what that is what that

736
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,679
is is i'm holding the strings

737
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,840
still in one place

738
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,279
and that creates a harmonic uh that

739
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,200
forces another that forces a node

740
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,960
halfway down the string

741
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,760
and you hear the the tone that's the

742
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:43,840
tone that's playing that's an octave up

743
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:44,930
all right

744
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,080
[Music]

745
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,240
i

746
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
and now for changing notes i realize i

747
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,799
should have the bass back up here uh

748
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:57,679
there are different uh there are

749
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,240
different ways to to change notes

750
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,679
either tension uh tension length length

751
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,240
or thickness um and so with length

752
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,679
uh by by changing let me grab the face

753
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,159
of the string is simply playing out

754
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,440
so playing like

755
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,519
[Music]

756
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,320
with each note i'm sure with each note

757
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,039
that goes up i'm shortening the string

758
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,960
the string gets shorter as i move my

759
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,799
hand up

760
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,200
now the thing is if you look at the bass

761
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,320
the bass real fast

762
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,559
you see uh each of the strings are about

763
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,840
the same length

764
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,799
and they're about the same thickness

765
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,480
where they differ or sorry they're

766
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,080
about the same tension where they differ

767
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,679
is actually in

768
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,519
thickness um

769
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,600
the e string at the bottom here is a lot

770
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,879
thicker

771
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,800
than the g string and that means it

772
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,960
moves more slowly creating

773
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,560
creating that lower tone um i can also

774
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,839
adjust the

775
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,320
tension i can also adjust the tension

776
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,720
using

777
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,320
uh using using these here um tools used

778
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:30,960
to

779
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,599
tune the face

780
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,440
[Music]

781
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,760
hi let's see what do i have next

782
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,520
oh so so for ample uh so if we start

783
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,839
with our very basic string

784
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,960
let me step back so i'm actually in the

785
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,839
camera to start

786
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,760
so if we start with our basic string

787
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,440
this gives a very

788
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,560
very quiet tone um and the big

789
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,160
the basics of amplification is well

790
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
make something bigger vibrate and i feel

791
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,400
like the best way

792
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,160
the best way to do this is to go back to

793
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,400
my true bluegrass roots

794
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,560
and to set up a a washed up base

795
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,920
so this is going to take a second i'm

796
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,160
here

797
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,880
oh boy so i don't know if you've heard

798
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,119
the draw uh the black picture hitting

799
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,079
the wall

800
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,640
you already heard it starting to sing

801
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,799
out

802
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,400
um and so i have the string here which

803
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,200
when taught and blocked does vibrate and

804
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,400
it's attached

805
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,520
to this it's attached to this watch then

806
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,920
which uh so now when the string vibrates

807
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,040
the wash tub vibrates as well

808
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,480
so sorry for the noise i'm going to try

809
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,240
to be as gentle as possible setting this

810
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,439
down by the microphone

811
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,119
wash tub base is actually a perfectly

812
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,960
valid instrument

813
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,560
there are actually versions of this

814
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,160
instrument in almost

815
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,240
every culture um and i just have a

816
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,079
pillow that i'm placing underneath the

817
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,280
base

818
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,680
uh under underneath the wash tub in

819
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,400
order to hold off the ground

820
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,480
it will just help the sound amplify a

821
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,839
little bit more

822
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,400
alright so

823
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:54,800
i'm placed here

824
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,280
it's been placed here uh this stick the

825
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,880
stick allows the string to be

826
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,079
uh to become taut so uh depending on

827
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,280
where you learned it from there are

828
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,800
actually a couple of different ways to

829
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,960
play to watch the face

830
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,240
i believe the most traditional method is

831
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,599
by by actually tilting the stick here

832
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,040
oh boy back and forth

833
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,079
whoa sorry i'm gonna tighten this real

834
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,520
fast

835
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,800
um i've had a bit of trouble attaching

836
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,760
the string

837
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,040
to the wash tab but so by leaning it

838
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,880
back

839
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,800
stay on

840
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,160
i don't know if you can actually

841
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,400
hear this

842
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,599
as well as i can

843
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,760
but by leaning it back you call uh it

844
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,000
creates it creates adds more tension to

845
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,839
the string which creates a higher tone

846
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,680
and uh many individuals also many

847
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,119
individuals build

848
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,440
very uh much more complex infrared bases

849
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,480
with proper

850
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,880
fingerboards on the top which we were

851
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,839
upgrading uh

852
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,200
washington faces which we'll actually

853
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:19,839
talk about in a second

854
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,640
all right and and i'm back

855
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,000
uh so

856
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,160
oh so where were we so essentially for

857
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,000
louder noise make a bigger thing vibrate

858
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,960
and that

859
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,640
is essentially the cornerstone of where

860
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,720
modern instruments uh where modern

861
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,640
instruments come from

862
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,960
as we can see on the next slide here's

863
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
actually a diagram that someone built

864
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,280
for a upright wash tub base so this is

865
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,280
still a homemade instrument with a

866
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,880
wash tub as as the

867
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,920
as the main body

868
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,760
um with this is actually ingeniously

869
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,079
done

870
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,320
with a lawnmower handle as the

871
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,440
fingerboard

872
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,680
um and then a bridge like we'd see in a

873
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,760
regular stringed instrument

874
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,320
and a chair leg to hold it up and

875
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,920
compare that with the diagram i have

876
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,119
next to it

877
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,160
where we where we have uh that shows

878
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,560
that shows the top of an instrument it

879
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,920
shows the bridge and underneath it

880
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,480
there's a sound post and a bass bar

881
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,160
and what that does is the strings

882
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,920
vibrate the bridge which vibrates the

883
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,520
rest of the instrument

884
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,200
and the sound post goes through to the

885
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,400
other side in order to

886
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,520
in order to create uh in order in order

887
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,839
to make it louder so

888
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,359
because

889
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,400
standing in the rebel a pile of

890
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,000
instruments in my apartment

891
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,839
playing fiddles so the way that's the

892
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,520
way it works i'm gonna grab this to

893
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,079
bring it

894
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,400
a lot closer to the camera so you can

895
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,640
see the strings

896
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,800
and the bridge and

897
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,880
this uh this allows us to vibrate the

898
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,480
whole instrument instead of

899
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,400
just how instead of just having these

900
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,000
strings like those

901
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,920
we've got the strings we've got the

902
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,319
stick and we've got the body but this

903
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:39,839
this allows more vibration of the body

904
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,599
which uh which allows us different tone

905
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:43,920
now

906
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,040
the last uh now the last uh main

907
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,560
difference between

908
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,760
different uh different types of

909
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,240
instrument is the size and what it's

910
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,119
made of

911
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,359
the fiddle and the base are actually

912
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,800
very similar shape

913
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,520
very similar material but just dear to

914
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,880
sheer size

915
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,040
including the thickness of the wood the

916
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,040
base is a lot lower

917
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,160
um one interesting

918
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,800
one interesting fun music fact is that

919
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,839
the f holes

920
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,960
on the violin they actually did a test

921
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,040
and they found that having having a uh

922
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,480
having a circular hole in the middle

923
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,960
like a guitar would actually make

924
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,560
would actually make it sound better but

925
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,400
violin traditionalists rebelled and

926
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,240
that's why the violins

927
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,920
the violin is the same now

928
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,520
let me just show you another interesting

929
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,839
thing

930
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,160
here i have an electric violet

931
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,760
uh unlike unlike the traditional

932
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,800
instrument

933
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,040
the most of the body here is just for

934
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,960
show the sound is created

935
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,079
by the by the string vibrating off the

936
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,440
bridge

937
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,839
which has a pickup and when plugged into

938
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:04,960
an amp

939
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,839
uh it's amplified through electronic

940
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:08,640
means

941
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:17,200
if i were to just play a node

942
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,960
hey it would be split a slightly out of

943
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,119
tune and b it would be a lot quieter

944
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,560
because the majority of the sound

945
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,920
doesn't come from the body of the

946
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,680
instrument

947
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,079
and uh the one that i had the one that i

948
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,440
have in the back there is acoustic

949
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,480
electric

950
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,680
with the guts

951
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,240
with the ability uh with with a pickup

952
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,400
inside of it but also the ability

953
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,839
to play it play it aloud

954
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,160
um i don't know what's that

955
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,560
so so that's just a brief overview of

956
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:50,880
how

957
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,720
sound works and essentially how we can

958
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,520
make sound louder and more different

959
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
um does anyone have any questions

960
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,800
comments snide remarks

961
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,839
no snide remarks actually uh

962
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,040
someone wants to know what your dog's

963
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,680
name is oh her name is louie she's the

964
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,400
best

965
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,560
um there's also a cat somewhere

966
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,839
a lot of people were wondering about the

967
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,680
watchtop base but i feel like you you

968
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,880
handled that already

969
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,520
so um

970
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,119
somebody's wanting to know if your

971
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,839
slides will be posted uh yes they should

972
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,839
be

973
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,599
not a lot of questions but a lot of love
