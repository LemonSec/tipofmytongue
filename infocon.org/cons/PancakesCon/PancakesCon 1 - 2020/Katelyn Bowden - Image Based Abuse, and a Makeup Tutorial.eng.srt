7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,440

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,840
we are going to be covering some topics

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,240
that you know it might be triggering to

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,680
some folks so i just want to give you a

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,159
heads up

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,159
totally cool if you need a break you

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,439
need to step out

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,880
um no judgment

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,679
all right

40
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,000
[Music]

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,079
all right now we're going to start by

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,840
kind of defining what is image-based

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,720
abuse

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,479
okay we have um a lot of people like to

45
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,640
refer to it as revenge porn which

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,479
i hate most of us in this industry do

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,280
because it's a really big misnomer um

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,799
the word revenge itself

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,640
means that this person did something to

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,799
deserve it it's very victim blaming

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,960
in itself the word pornography also

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,240
implies that there's some form of

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,840
consent involved

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,560
um so you know we prefer the terms

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
non-consensual pornography

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,119
as well as image-based abuse both of

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,520
which do cover a lot more than what

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,800
the term revenge porn does um because a

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,680
lot of what we do

60
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,000
isn't necessarily an exit leaking these

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,720
photos

62
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,720
um very often times we're dealing with

63
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,480
deep fakes we're dealing with

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,720
um sextortion we're dealing with

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,200
somebody that has gotten hacked there

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,319
they may have sold a device or something

67
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:28,800
like that

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,519
and the person who bought it off of them

69
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,239
is now

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,480
releasing their nudes they may have had

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,680
a device stolen

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,800
which is what happened to me um and

73
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,080
so it covers all of that

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,319
now when i say what happened to me it's

75
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,760
because you know i

76
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,280
always like to tell people the reason i

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,959
got started with this

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,200
um is because i'm a victim of it a

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,160
couple years ago

80
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,200
i was a bartender um i had no idea i

81
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,440
didn't know my vpn for my xf i didn't

82
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,319
know anything

83
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,680
about tech or um you know

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,200
leaked nudes or non-consensual

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,959
pornography i didn't know about

86
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,040
any of that the only thing i knew about

87
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
was vague

88
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,159
you know memories of hearing about

89
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,920
something the faffening

90
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,599
you know when celebrities all had their

91
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,000
names leaked um

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,680
someone had stolen my ex-boyfriend's

93
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,480
phone and they had done so in order to

94
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,680
get the news

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,480
um there's a whole subculture of people

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,840
on the internet that trade

97
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,159
these pictures as if they were you know

98
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,760
pokemon cards or

99
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,879
baseball cards hey i'll give you jessica

100
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,280
if you'll post a picture of jennifer and

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,879
so on and so forth

102
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,040
um these are not things that are on the

103
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,879
dark mat these are

104
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,480
you know things that are on the clear

105
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,080
net they're googleable

106
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,599
they are um you know they

107
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,560
are easy to find and there's a lot of

108
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,840
websites dedicated

109
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,599
just to sharing these news um

110
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,519
so i became a victim of that um

111
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,040
and i found out that there was

112
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,640
absolutely no

113
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,879
you know justice for this sort of thing

114
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,159
in my state i

115
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,200
lived in ohio at the time and

116
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,120
even though i had you know somebody that

117
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,640
confessed to doing it

118
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,480
i had already found out who was behind

119
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
it um

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,238
they said there no laws were broken so i

121
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,279
never got

122
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,160
any sort of justice in my case and i got

123
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,000
really mad and decided to

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
help other people get justice in theirs

125
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,080
first thing we did was help

126
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,840
introduce a bill in the state of ohio um

127
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,400
hb497

128
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,919
um which went through it is now a law

129
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,280
that makes it a criminal offense to

130
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,240
share pictures

131
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,040
of a partner or to share pictures of

132
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,639
anybody without their consent

133
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,520
any kind of sexual images it's just a

134
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,600
misdemeanor it's not

135
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,720
you know the harshest law but it is

136
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,000
something that is there it's a good

137
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
deterrent most of all

138
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,080
this is the language of the law no

139
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,400
person shall knowingly disseminate

140
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,479
an image from another person

141
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,560
as we all know obviously that if the

142
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,600
person is under 18 it is a federal crime

143
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,800
um but there are uh i believe

144
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,520
53 states now that have laws that would

145
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,360
protect adults as well

146
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,080
um now the problem with this law is that

147
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,280
last line

148
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,320
the intent to harm the victim

149
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,400
trying to prove intent when creating a

150
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,840
charge is a really really difficult

151
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,199
thing to do

152
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,320
a lot it's it's a very

153
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,680
high requirement to ask people just

154
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,919
investigating the crime to prove the

155
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,520
intent that should be left up to the

156
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,560
prosecutor

157
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,960
however the way the laws are written um

158
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,639
they can't even be charged unless

159
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,520
they can prove that they meant to harm

160
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,639
so

161
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,960
um just want to let everybody watching

162
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,000
this know

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,840
hey sharing other people's news without

164
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
their consent is harmful

165
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,759
actively harming the person by sharing

166
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,960
their nudes

167
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,840
um so now you know there's your intent

168
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
sorry

169
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,680
so what i've talked about this whole

170
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,400
underground subculture um in these you

171
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,120
know

172
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,520
areas they are called winds the pictures

173
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,039
themselves are called winds do you have

174
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:19,600
winds of

175
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,160
so and so um and it is a whole

176
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,080
wind-sharing culture

177
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,600
um it's a community they call themselves

178
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,720
um the exposure community i've gotten a

179
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,680
few emails

180
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,120
people are very mad that i have

181
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,000
disrupted the exposure community

182
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,919
but these are the platforms that are

183
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,520
used um

184
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,120
and there are more there trust me this

185
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,720
is just a this is not the most

186
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,560
comprehensive list but this lets you

187
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,840
know how

188
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,400
widespread this is yes you see slack on

189
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,120
there

190
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,919
yes you know obviously every uh social

191
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:52,479
media

192
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,080
i didn't even start listing all the porn

193
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,919
sites um

194
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,360
you know but you're also seeing imgur

195
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,280
you're seeing facebook messenger

196
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,880
any messenger service where people can

197
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,360
exchange pictures is going to be used

198
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,880
to share nudes without consent that's

199
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,360
how that goes whisper we are seeing it

200
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,880
more and more on tick talk which is

201
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,039
terrifying because tick tock's

202
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,800
audience is usually under age

203
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,759
so in each of these platforms you know

204
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
some are better than others that

205
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,080
responding

206
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,160
when we have to you know send a takedown

207
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,400
order facebook is actually really great

208
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,840
about it they take things down really

209
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,720
quickly

210
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,120
um and they have some programs in place

211
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,720
for all of facebook's flaws

212
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,080
they are really trying to tackle this um

213
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,720
the porn sites are great i had a thread

214
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,240
a few weeks ago

215
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,360
about how pornhub is really proactive

216
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,199
when it comes to removing pictures

217
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,720
and videos that are shared without

218
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,240
consent um

219
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,720
realize there's a ton of consensual

220
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,560
pornography out there there are so many

221
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,199
people

222
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,919
that want you to look at their bodies so

223
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,879
having

224
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,360
you know stuff on there that people

225
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,000
don't want you to

226
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,199
see it's just not necessary and it just

227
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,280
creates an issue for them um

228
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,120
this is a screenshot of

229
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,680
the um a little bit of the wing culture

230
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,120
most of you guys will recognize this is

231
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,160
4chan

232
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,199
um obviously i have edited these this is

233
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:17,599
a

234
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,800
4chan slash s this is a really common

235
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,879
place we do see these images

236
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,000
um being shared oftentimes they do

237
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,599
have doxing information whether it's

238
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,199
full name where they work where they go

239
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,240
to school

240
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,279
where they're from um you know

241
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,120
it's not quite as bad as some of the

242
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,799
websites that are solely dedicated to

243
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,200
this

244
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,559
obviously if you know anything about

245
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,559
4chan it's not completely

246
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,279
dedicated to this whole wind sharing

247
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:43,919
thing

248
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,399
but it you can just see with the text

249
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:46,959
how

250
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,480
much they objectify us in here we're not

251
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,040
humans anymore we're just a bunch of

252
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,880
pictures of butts and boobs

253
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,720
we're not you know we don't have lives

254
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,800
outside of just being objects this is

255
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,959
actually um one of the websites that's

256
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:05,839
dedicated

257
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,640
to it to sharing these names without

258
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,279
consent

259
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,640
um as you see this is not a large area

260
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,200
they're looking for hardin county ohio

261
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,320
um the there's only a you know a few

262
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,040
thousand

263
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,640
people that live there it's not a big

264
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,120
area

265
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,160
everybody knows each other um

266
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,320
you know there's mansfield but look at

267
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,399
they're using first last names they're

268
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,160
saying where they're from um

269
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,560
it's not a densely populated area so

270
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,320
this is everywhere this is just one

271
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,640
little tiny piece of ohio

272
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,040
um because these websites dedicate you

273
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,800
know they separate us into [ __ ] by

274
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,440
state

275
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,720
quote unquote um so

276
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,279
no matter where you're from you know you

277
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,399
could be living in the middle of north

278
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,399
dakota and there is probably

279
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,800
a few threads out there people's trading

280
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,200
news without consent in your town

281
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,360
um and these things show up in google

282
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,279
searches they show up on duckduckgo

283
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,560
being any

284
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,959
sort of search engines so when future

285
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,440
employers are looking for these people

286
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,120
you know just doing a quick background

287
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,440
look they are coming up with this

288
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,079
i imagine you know you guys can figure

289
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,760
out how that works when it comes to

290
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,920
employment especially if somebody is

291
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,680
going to school to be a teacher or a

292
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,959
nurse or

293
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,959
any other job that would require some

294
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,560
kind of behavioral contract

295
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,480
now most people would say okay well the

296
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
first thing maybe you should just

297
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,320
shouldn't take these pictures

298
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,240
um if you didn't take these nudes they

299
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,839
wouldn't be out there this wouldn't be a

300
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,480
problem if you girls weren't so [ __ ]

301
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,720
um but the truth is it doesn't matter

302
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
okay um i'll get more into that in a

303
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
minute but really it doesn't come down

304
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,600
to the girls

305
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,160
it or the victims because this happens

306
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,440
to men too

307
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,720
um this comes down to somebody doing

308
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,279
something

309
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,640
with someone else's without consent okay

310
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,240
if they take the internet out of the

311
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,240
equation you're not allowed to just walk

312
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,760
down the street and tear someone's shirt

313
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,440
off and expose them to the world that is

314
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,519
illegal you would go to jail

315
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,680
so the fact that we aren't criminalizing

316
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,040
this on the internet is

317
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,959
insane um it's really problematic and

318
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:19,680
it's

319
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,360
a big sign of you know rape culture

320
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,680
to sit here and say it is completely the

321
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,120
victim's fault

322
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,279
um now mind you there are ways to go

323
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,560
about doing this safely

324
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,680
you don't want to um

325
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,519
you know just send them to everybody

326
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,959
that could possibly ask you know

327
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,920
obviously you want to

328
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,000
you know reserve these images for a

329
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,760
trusted partner or

330
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,640
you know just do a little research with

331
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,519
with the person

332
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,720
figure out who they are if there's

333
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,800
somebody that you can trust

334
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,440
um and these are ways that you can

335
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,959
minimize it but really when it comes

336
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,160
down to it

337
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,560
you don't even have to take news to be a

338
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,079
victim of this

339
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,920
um you know we've all been hearing about

340
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,200
deep fakes

341
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,720
now mind you when you're doing deep

342
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,480
fakes that takes a lot

343
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,720
of data to create those pictures they

344
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,320
have to get a lot of pictures from

345
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
social media um

346
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,880
now mind you if you do you know go on

347
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,480
most people's social media you'll get

348
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,720
enough pictures a lot of people do take

349
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,839
selfies they have

350
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,240
they're tagged in photos all you need to

351
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,120
do is get a wide variety of images

352
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,560
that are from different angles different

353
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,480
lighting that sort of thing

354
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
but there is other technology out there

355
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,600
like deep nudes

356
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,560
they only need one photo that's it one

357
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,519
photo and

358
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,320
a couple clicks wait a few minutes and

359
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,240
the clothes are gone

360
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,320
now mind you they aren't perfect the

361
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,720
scariest thing about deep nudes it is

362
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,000
incredibly gendered um no matter what

363
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,920
picture is on there they're going to add

364
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,480
a female vulva and a set of breasts

365
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,120
so obviously we know what that tech is

366
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,760
being used for

367
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
but we also for a very long time have

368
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,240
seen fake news

369
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,079
and what those are are photoshopped

370
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,160
images they're changed to appear to be

371
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,360
the victim or they're just

372
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,279
other porn stars that happen to look

373
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,560
like somebody

374
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
i mean you can catch a still of a porn

375
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,000
image from a video

376
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,360
you know where their head is turned and

377
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
they just vaguely

378
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,519
look enough like one person that you can

379
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,200
take that to one of those

380
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,160
trade those when sharing websites and

381
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,839
say it's that person

382
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,120
and that person is left with

383
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,760
no justice whatsoever because they can't

384
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,240
even

385
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,680
press criminal charges because it's not

386
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,760
them in the image they also have an

387
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,360
issue with removal

388
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,120
because the way that we're able to get

389
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,160
things down is by using dmca

390
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,199
the digital millennium copyright act and

391
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,320
it would it's not them in the image they

392
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,680
don't have the copyright they're not

393
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,959
able to claim

394
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,320
a copyright infringement on that

395
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,040
so these are different ways that you can

396
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,720
sext a little safer

397
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,519
um obviously if someone is pressuring

398
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,480
you to do something that you're not

399
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,199
comfortable with

400
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,800
you shouldn't do it um i think that's

401
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,720
very basic and that goes along with a

402
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,320
lot of things that

403
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,240
you know when it comes to sex ed and

404
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,000
things like that that people aren't

405
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,959
really you know learning when it comes

406
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,079
to sex is that

407
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,519
you don't have to do things that you're

408
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,440
not comfortable with that's it

409
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,000
you can say no no isn't it is a complete

410
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
sentence

411
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,199
um make sure that you have your

412
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,720
boundaries ready and you're sticking to

413
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,600
them

414
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,639
um you're not allowing yourself to be um

415
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,639
violated in the way that you're not

416
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,800
respecting your own boundaries

417
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,440
you deserve that kind of respect um only

418
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,720
show new to the partner that you trust

419
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,360
like i said

420
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,160
you can also if you're somebody that

421
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,959
likes to

422
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,040
have multiple partners at once that is

423
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,519
fine just make sure that they all

424
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,120
are aware of what your boundaries are

425
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,519
and um you also want to spell out your

426
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,959
wishes to each one you want to

427
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,959
explicitly state in writing

428
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,639
i do not want these images to be leaked

429
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,800
or shared and one thing that you can do

430
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
is grab a screenshot of that if somehow

431
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,040
these images do get out

432
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
then you have a little bit of recourse

433
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,560
with that your lawyer will thank you for

434
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,518
having that screenshot

435
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,519
always always always communicate with

436
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,199
your partner this is just basic sex

437
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,160
ed stuff um you always want to check and

438
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,600
make sure like hey they're not hanging

439
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,639
out with grandma

440
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,920
at that moment that you want to send a

441
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,560
nude make sure you get consent

442
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,760
to send as well as getting consent to

443
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,720
receive

444
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,199
um and then you also want to make sure

445
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,399
that your partner is also keeping their

446
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,600
data secure

447
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,639
when it comes to my personal

448
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,199
you know experience my ex did not even

449
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,240
lock his phone

450
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,320
and i was dumb enough to send him nudes

451
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,839
i am well aware that was

452
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,120
on me a little bit um but when it came

453
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,240
down to it it was

454
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,839
on the person who stole the phone but

455
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,000
had i encouraged him to have better

456
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,880
security practices

457
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,320
you know things could be very different

458
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,839
dc it's not changing

459
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,759
sorry i'm not tech

460
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,480
savvy if you all know this i hope you do

461
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,040
by now i talk about it all the time

462
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,720
um anyway so that is my brief overview

463
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
obviously um with longer talks i can get

464
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,240
more in depth in this

465
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,480
and i'm always happy to answer questions

466
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,800
and share the knowledge i know

467
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,360
um i didn't get into watermarking that

468
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,800
is one more way that you can stick

469
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,360
safely is to watermark images with the

470
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,680
recipient's name that way if they do

471
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,600
leak you know who leaked them and you

472
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,360
can prove that in a courtroom

473
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,720
um so anyway you can follow the badass

474
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,120
army that's the organization that i run

475
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,600
at the badass underscore army we're also

476
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,839
www.badass army

477
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,120
and then you can also follow me on

478
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,199
twitter um

479
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,279
so do we have any questions

480
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,400
i know i just went through a lot of

481
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,240
stuff oh very quickly

482
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,720
no questions at all i can't see if

483
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,280
anyone

484
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,640
is typing anything so um

485
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,520
let's see looking through the q a okay

486
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,799
yeah i can't see the q a right now

487
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,520
um edith asked if you can include the

488
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,120
websites that you're referencing in your

489
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,000
talk and i'm not

490
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,559
sure which websites edith was referring

491
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,840
to but

492
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,520
um i assume she means the wind sharing

493
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,960
websites i'd rather not

494
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,799
give them the urls

495
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,559
um i assure you they're out there and

496
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,919
you would probably be able to find them

497
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:46,640
easily

498
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,840
but i will be damned if i'm going to

499
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,679
advertise those guys so

500
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,880
totally understandable um melinda asks

501
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,960
if some states are better at protecting

502
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,640
victims than others

503
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,760
absolutely um some states are

504
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
they have a little bit more flexibility

505
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,160
when it comes to that intense law

506
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,720
as well as some of them do have um other

507
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
specifications written into laws for

508
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,160
things like deep fakes

509
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,440
or doxing um you know and then some are

510
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,320
even worse than ohio's ohio is about

511
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,720
middle ground some are worse as in they

512
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,360
require

513
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,960
it to be an ex-partner um so if you

514
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
weren't in an established relationship

515
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,240
with the person that leaked your nudes

516
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
you have absolutely no recourse

517
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,840
um so it depends some states are better

518
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,919
some states are worse

519
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,600
we've got one law going through in

520
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,559
mississippi of all places that is

521
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,039
would actually really change things

522
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,080
because it's written

523
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,480
so well

524
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,679
anything else let's see if there's

525
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,039
anything new

526
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,160
somebody wants to know where they can

527
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,960
get that shirt oh you can get this shirt

528
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,440
um

529
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,720
at the um badass army shop

530
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,760
uh www.badassammyarmy.org

531
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,320
shop or slash store i don't know there's

532
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,960
uh

533
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,360
if you go to our website for badass army

534
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,880
you can see

535
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,080
the um the shop and we've got a lot of

536
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,679
really cool shirts we also have

537
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,720
um we just got our logo redesigned to be

538
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,679
all like

539
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,559
that metal tree where you can barely

540
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,240
read it

541
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,559
and we have the info sweatshirts as well

542
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,880
there is a question about

543
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,720
uh do you know if more states are

544
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
planning to add bills like ohio and if

545
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,039
so

546
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,480
is there any traction on creating

547
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,240
something like copa

548
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,360
in regards to consent matters um

549
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,360
i know that there's a lot of things

550
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,600
going through right now um

551
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,039
i believe right now we only have laws

552
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,600
that would just be working against the

553
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,960
revenge porn laws

554
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,400
in a few states but we're also working

555
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,240
on getting a federal law that would fill

556
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,159
in the gaps between those states

557
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,799
as we know the internet is not just your

558
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,679
little neighborhood

559
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,679
um so somebody leaking your news could

560
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,280
be from

561
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
across the country or even outside of

562
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,559
the country and a lot of people find

563
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,600
themselves with

564
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,880
nobody willing to cross this

565
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,200
jurisdictional lines

566
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,159
so we are working on a federal law that

567
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,679
we've introduced with representative

568
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,880
jackie speer

569
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,559
that would fill in the gaps

570
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,760
and do you have any advice for people in

571
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,360
the security community that might be pin

572
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,799
testers or anything like that

573
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,559
about the best way that they can help

574
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,000
out um

575
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,840
the best way that anyone can help out is

576
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,360
really just letting people know that

577
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,400
we're here

578
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,480
um and having those conversations

579
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,159
regarding consent whether it's with your

580
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,600
partner whether it's with

581
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,559
your kids just talking to people um

582
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,480
about what consent means when it's

583
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,679
translated online

584
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,520
a lot of people have a pretty decent

585
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,400
grasp of you know asking for permission

586
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,000
in real life but when it comes to the

587
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,520
internet a lot of people are really

588
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,200
missing that connection

589
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,280
so i think that is really the biggest

590
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,600
hurdle that we've come across is really

591
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,600
expressing how consent and agency

592
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,799
can play a role over the internet as

593
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,400
well

594
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,480
so that is really the biggest way anyone

595
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,080
can help out

596
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,799
we are working on getting some more

597
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,600
volunteer

598
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
opportunities for people right now we

599
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,440
are taking a little bit of a break just

600
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,960
because it is

601
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,640
um with everything else going on the

602
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,559
emotional

603
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,880
work of trying to talk to victims at the

604
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,159
very worst time

605
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,440
is gonna break us if we keep

606
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,120
trying i mean there's a lot of emotions

607
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,799
going on with everybody right now that's

608
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,799
dealing with this pandemic and

609
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,080
it's a lot so once we get back we are

610
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,200
hoping to uh you know really we're doing

611
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,720
a rebranding we're changing a lot of

612
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,000
things around

613
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,880
um we're getting our goals a little bit

614
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,640
clearer and we do plan on introducing a

615
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,080
better way for everybody that wants to

616
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,360
volunteer to help

617
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,120
you know give their time to badass

618
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,840
um someone wants to know if you have any

619
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,440
experience with fighting the sort of

620
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,600
thing outside the usa

621
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,520
oh absolutely um in fact most of these

622
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,799
websites that i've talked about that are

623
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,480
clarinet are hosted

624
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,440
um overseas especially in places that

625
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,960
don't recognize copyright

626
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,240
um you know one of the recent ones that

627
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,600
we've seen crop up is

628
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,400
you know a russian url so it's we're

629
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,120
seeing it

630
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,159
a lot acro overseas um there's a huge

631
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,840
issue with it in the uk as well as

632
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,080
australia in fact it is

633
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,679
in australia i believe it's almost one

634
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,520
in four or five

635
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,760
social media users have experienced some

636
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,280
form of image abuse

637
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,320
so it's not just limited to the usa

638
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,559
it's a global issue and it's something

639
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,840
that as more people

640
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,480
are relying on technology to communicate

641
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,240
and foster relationships it's just going

642
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,600
to become a bigger and bigger issue

643
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,640
are we ready to uh do the makeup

644
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,120

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,000

a little bit of a makeup tutorial a lot

651
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,919
of people ask me to do my makeup but i

652
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,600
don't have the guts

653
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
to get on here without makeup to do it

654
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,440
before so

655
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,159

675
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,559
um eyeshadow primer as well as

676
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,919
my nyx matte matte um

677
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,159
skin primer as well i almost lost an eye

678
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,400
too because i'm not used to

679
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,200
sticking things towards my eyes so uh it

680
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,720
was hard

681
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,039
well beauty is pain

682
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,799
all right so i understand that my

683
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,720
way of doing makeup might not be the way

684
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,400
that everybody else does i tend to focus

685
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,080
on things that i'm most likely to screw

686
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,480
up

687
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,000
first um i i really

688
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,600
shake some people to the core when i

689
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,120
mentioned that

690
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,240
i do um browse

691
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,520
and shadow first all right

692
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,279
um so i told you what he used to prime

693
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,640
and this is what i'm using for um brows

694
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,919
this is a

695
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,120
ancient elf

696
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,840
elf brow kit

697
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,720
and then i am just using i don't even

698
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,799
know it might have came with the kit

699
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,320
as you tell as you can tell i'm very

700
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,000
fancy

701
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,559
okay tilt your head up please

702
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,000
and basically what we're going to do is

703
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,480
just fill in the brows

704
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,400
okay i'm not one of people that you know

705
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,640
you need to add a ton of extra

706
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,640
brows completely change the shape i just

707
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,840
fill in what's already there

708
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,159
will it cover up the gray ones yeah a

709
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:57,600
little bit

710
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,240
this is an awkward position

711
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,440
now when coming when doing eyebrows you

712
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,880
don't have to make them be twins

713
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,799
as long as they're sisters it's okay

714
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,720
if you haven't heard that before it's

715
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,840
something people should remember they

716
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,799
don't have to be

717
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,840
exactly the same

718
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,880
all right so i am going to be uh

719
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,320
doing a bright green look on pc here

720
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,440
i'm going to be using this anastasia

721
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,559
palette

722
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,679

725
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,159
colors

726
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,039
as you see some really bright neons

727
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,158
um so you got this for me for christmas

728
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,279
um and i'm gonna start with i don't know

729
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:51,760
the name

730
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,120
c1 and i'm just using a flat brush

731
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,279
because i want to apply a lot of color

732
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,600
close your eyes tilt your head up please

733
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,760
and we're just going to apply this right

734
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,720
in the inner corners

735
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,559
i always go from light to dark

736
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,919
and work my way out

737
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,720
try to relax your eyes okay

738
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,799
now i'm relaxing or attacking him i'm

739
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,799
attacking his eyes

740
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,159
nice use of hyperbole right there

741
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,679
and i always just bring the extra up

742
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,279
to accentuate accentuate the brow line

743
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,640
next i'm going to be going with this

744
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,720
lime green which i love

745
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,320
that lime green i'm gonna be filling in

746
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,879
the middle

747
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,520
now mind you i'm not blending yet i'm

748
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,960
just putting the color

749
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,440
on i'm just trying to get it on the

750
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,480
eyelid as

751
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:16,720
generally where i want it

752
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,240
that's why i'm not using a big

753
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,159
you know fluffy brush i'm using a flat

754
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,279
brush just because

755
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,120
right now the goal is to just put the

756
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,840
color on

757
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,679

eyeshadow so next i'm going to use this

760
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
e3

761
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,840
for the outer lids

762
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:59,840
and i'm going to bring that around

763
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,120

764
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,760
corners

765
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,279
and then up into

766
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,720
that hollow right there i don't even

767
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,679
know what you'd call that

768
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,320
i watch enough makeup tutorials but this

769
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,120

770
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,559

785
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,279
but just try it now i'm going to use the

786
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:27,760
other end

787
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,440
of this brush it's slightly fluffier

788
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
than me

789
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,840
first one i was using to add color i'm

790
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,320
going to use this a3 it's

791
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,000
a shiny lime green

792
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,120
right there in the middle close to the

793
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,678
lash line

794
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,840
to accentuate them

795
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,880
and then i want to fill in just a little

796
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,200
bit more of the dark

797
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:05,840
out in the corners

798
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,039
and then up into the crease

799
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,640
that's the word i was looking for crease

800
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,159
words words are hard all right

801
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,559
so tc open as you see

802
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,918
looking beautiful so far

803
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,360
close you gotta do the it is just close

804
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,679
them

805
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,240
close them and then you gotta open

806
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,960
slowly

807
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,320
for the camera do you want to make how

808
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,600
do you yeah that's perfect okay

809
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,880
yes okay now

810
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,200
um i'm going to be doing the

811
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,720
concealer foundation and i know everyone

812
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,159
was really mad when i brought this up

813
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,480
yesterday that i do this in this order

814
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,120
but that's because as you see here i am

815
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,679
messy

816
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,760
and we only have like green under

817
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,880
circles

818
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,760
so this is going to help cover that now

819
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,760
when it comes to concealing under eye

820
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,120
circles because i don't know about you

821
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,320
guys but i am perpetually

822
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,080
exhausted and

823
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,240
um i use a good red tinted

824
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,480
it's got a little bit pink tint to it

825
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,919
concealer because that

826
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,399
really does wonders with concealing

827
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:29,600
under eye circles

828
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,320

wearing masks

859
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,440

underneath the eyes

867
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,800
the next step is

868
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,280
some foundation i prefer this catrice

869
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,879
cosmetics

870
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,839
liquid coverage foundation it's actually

871
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,679
super cheap

872
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,079
it's like 10 bucks a bottle but it works

873
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,839
really well

874
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,839
and you just want to add a little bit

875
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,359
now mind you like i said we're wearing

876
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,560
masks right now

877
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,359
so you don't have to worry about

878
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,239
anything

879
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,800

880
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,159
all right um

881
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,520
and then you just do the same thing you

882
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,839
blend

883
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,480
it's like a soft jack camera

884
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,800
yep pretty much beauty is pain

885
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,200
my husband is well aware i will walk

886
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,800
down the street and if i see somebody

887
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,440
that like

888
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,280
i can tell put a little bit of effort

889
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,880
into their look i'm just like

890
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,320

891
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,440
you know i'm just that person but

892
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,680
now you know maybe y'all will understand

893
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,760
why i do that because i know how much

894
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,079
effort went into it

895
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,119
this isn't the easiest thing

896
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,359
especially if you are like me and

897
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,040
naturally look like a bridge troll

898
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,640
luckily um you know with tc working on

899
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,800
this here and letting me

900
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,920
him being my canvas for this

901
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,640
bit of artwork i have a much lovelier

902
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,320
canvas to start off with than what i'm

903
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,599
used to

904
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,079
oh stop you're just so pretty

905
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,640
all right now comes contouring

906
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,000
which is super fun all right for

907
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,640
contouring i like to use more concealer

908
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,680
that's the i use the nyx

909
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,760
nyx hd and this is just very light and

910
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,000
lighter than i would normally use for

911
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,680
any kind of concealer and then i go

912
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,240
along

913
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,599
you want to highlight any pieces of your

914
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,839
skull that stick out i know that sounds

915
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:28,720
weird but that's

916
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,599
basically what you're doing you want to

917
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,920
put some in the middle of your nose

918
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,520
up here through the forehead and i like

919
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,040
to add that little

920
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,880
tiny bit that makes you look like you

921
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,320

922
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,599

924
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,240

925
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,240

931
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,079
tip your nose i wonder how many people

932
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,040
are just dying right now

933
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,280
drinks coming in this is not good timing

934
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,960
to say that

935
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,359
i'm just saying oh okay bad phrasing

936
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,440
yeah breathe in come on

937
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,560

938
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,240
people are billy laughing right now

939
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,960
all right so i'm gonna also be using

940
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,000
some bronzer

941
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,920
this is the wander beauty trip to costa

942
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,320
rica it's like a nice

943
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,240
pale bronzer and how that works

944
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,280
is i start it up in the hairline

945
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,640
honestly you're going to put this around

946
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,960
the hairline you're going to accentuate

947
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,040
this is where you accentuate the shadows

948
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,599
those of you who know about camouflage

949
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,440
know that you know normally

950
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,520
you would i don't know how does that

951
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,359
work you can have me get that backwards

952
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,200
uh let's see you've used the light

953
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,119
colors how to make your face flats you

954
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,400
want to put the

955
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,599
dark colors dark colors on the

956
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,920
ridges and light colors in the hollows i

957
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,800
think

958
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,720
okay it's been like 15 years i don't

959
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,040
know all right and then you also want to

960
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,040
do that below the brow bone to create a

961
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,440
shadow

962
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,440
i think they gave us like one powerpoint

963
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,599
slide on that basic training

964
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,200
and then you want to also use that to

965
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,480
shape the nose a little bit

966
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,839
the slope right there

967
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,280
all right and then you're going to want

968
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,119
to add just a teensy little bit of blush

969
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,160
oh i broke that

970
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,240
brush exploded i fixed it

971
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,920
just a little bit of blush i have no

972
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,920
idea what kind of blush this is i got it

973
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,280
in an ipsy bag

974
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,640
like i don't know a few months ago

975
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,839
it's pink

976
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,760
oh you're not supposed to blow on that

977
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,599
and then put it on their face

978
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,520
because it's not sanitary normally but

979
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,599
it's my husband right he's got all my

980
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,760
verbs

981
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,520
he has all my germs um

982
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,880
all right and then you're going to want

983
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,359
to set that up

984
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,480
i can't see myself it's okay you look

985
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,720

989
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,480
does is make it so it sets um

990
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,800
you don't want makeup rubbing off on

991
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,680
your masks

992
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,280

993
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,040
is eyeliner

994
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,319

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,839
liquid on other people that much

1002
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,960
so this could be real bad in fact

1003
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,520
i'm just gonna go ahead and say yes this

1004
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,160

1010
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,440
you also want to what i do is i go

1011
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,520
backwards to get a really sharp point

1012
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,839
and you want to bring it down in the

1013
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,839
lashes

1014
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,839
oh lord this is not going to be even

1015
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,560
i messed this all up i am so sorry

1016
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,760
if you guys want to learn how to do

1017
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,319
eyeliner correctly

1018
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,599
and not from me

1019
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,760
um you know there's other tutorials on

1020
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,680
youtube

1021
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,240
i really like making tutorials i like

1022
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,800
her a lot

1023
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,160
she's really down to earth

1024
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,720
and uh explains things in a way i get

1025
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,599
as you guys can probably guess i am much

1026
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,599
better at doing my own makeup than i am

1027
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:06,880
doing my husband's

1028
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,319
but oh well oh

1029
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,319
gosh that's real bad

1030
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,079
sorry i'm trying i try

1031
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,160
i got a hot quarantine date later i'm

1032
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,760
sure she'll understand

1033
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,920
she's better all right so

1034
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,920
finish this off by adding a little

1035
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,599
mascara

1036
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,079
i was gonna put lashes on him but

1037
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,640
long story short his teenage son used

1038
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,598
all my lash glue

1039
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,079
to put a googly eye on our cat

1040
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,800
so yeah but where did he learn that from

1041
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,079
i might have had some influence in that

1042
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,359
no regrets um

1043
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,880
ready for this second we gotta highlight

1044
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,000
real quick real quick

1045
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,240
just highlight real quick okay

1046
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,440
highlight's very important

1047
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,079
you cannot highlight enough yes you can

1048
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,640
i've seen some really bad highlight

1049
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,000
where people just look like they were

1050
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,160
dipped in gold and it's not a good look

1051
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,399
so

1052
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,880
you want to highlight around the brow

1053
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,240
or not the brow the cheekbones

1054
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,839
and down the nose and up around the

1055
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,079
brows

1056
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,680
there we go and like i said it is

1057
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,280
you know makeup in the time of the

1058
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,440
coronavirus

1059
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,560
so you don't have to worry about

1060
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,160
anything below your nose

1061
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,240
no lipstick in fact i don't recommend it

1062
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,280
because it's just going to get on the

1063
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,720
inside of your mask

1064
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,839
and make it harder to breathe through it

1065
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,160
and as you see i am if you didn't know

1066
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,920
i've been making masks

1067
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,359
and donating them to whoever needs them

1068
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,000
but i did make a wonderful one for tc

1069
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,319
just for today it has pancakes all over

1070
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,119
it for

1071
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,760
pancakes gone um please ignore his

1072
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,000
eyeliner because i am terrible

1073
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,200
but ta-da

1074
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,839
i'm smiling but you can't see it

1075
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,680
all right i hope everybody is staying

1076
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,240
safe um be kind to one another

1077
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,480
and uh don't touch your face wash your

1078
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,240
hands

1079
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,160
we do have a couple of questions on the

1080
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,079
makeup section if you don't mind a

1081
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,599
little bit of time

1082
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,440
um someone was wanting to know if you

1083
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,960
would be doing anything differently if

1084
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,160
he was going to be wearing glasses

1085
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,800
i might um accentuate the eyeliner a

1086
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,560
little bit

1087
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,960
um if he was going to be wearing glasses

1088
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,760
as well as

1089
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,920
and i didn't get to do this um curl the

1090
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,359
lashes that way they don't hit the

1091
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,359
glasses and get them all smudgy

1092
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,040
um but yeah no other than that i don't

1093
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,839
really change it too much when i wear

1094
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,760
glasses

1095
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,640
someone was asking what concealer brand

1096
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,800
do you use or recommend

1097
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,160
um i use both for both of these um

1098
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,520
this is a nyx concealer

1099
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,319
i like these because they have um in

1100
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,319
both the liquid form

1101
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,440
as well as the little pots and

1102
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,599
i use the liquid form for contouring and

1103
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,440
i use a little pots because they have

1104
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,240
um a lot of pink tones like i said you

1105
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,440
want to use pink tones to cover

1106
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,839
dark circles and i don't sleep so

1107
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,200
covering dark circles is really

1108
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,520
important

1109
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,880
and are there any specific makeup brands

1110
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,800
you like to use

1111
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,400
um i really like to use urban decay um

1112
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,599
i do like um

1113
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,599
nyx nyx i don't even know if you say

1114
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,119
that i think nyx is the brand

1115
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,280
like some lice brand or something i

1116
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,880
don't know we're gonna roll with that i

1117
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,800
like the nyx brand because it is a

1118
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,400
little bit more affordable

1119
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,119
um it's most you know i am just poor as

1120
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,400
hell so i love

1121
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,920
the more affordable brands that can

1122
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,440
bring the quality as well

1123
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,280
um jeffree star comes out with some

1124
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,760
amazing amazing lipsticks and lip

1125
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,960
um glossies that i prefer um

1126
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,200
as well as the morphe has some great

1127
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,160
palettes out there for eyeshadows

1128
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,000
and a question that got asked and i'll

1129
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,599
make this the last one

1130
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,200
and i'm also curious about this do you

1131
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,200
dampen your beauty blender or do you use

1132
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,319
it dry

1133
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:22,000
um i have dampened it before um

1134
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,319
and i do sometimes it depends on my mood

1135
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,240
um if i'm gonna be on camera i usually

1136
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:26,640
don't

1137
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,680
because uh like i said bridge troll so i

1138
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,400
want to cover

1139
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,359
everything as much as possible and when

1140
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,040
you dampen your beauty blender it tends

1141
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,079
to um

1142
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,520
you know make things a little sheer i

1143
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,200
don't want things to be sheer i want you

1144
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,480
to see makeup i don't want you to see me

1145
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,599
so um i know you're supposed to dampen

1146
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,480
your beauty blender

1147
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,760
just depends on how i'm feeling that day

1148
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,280
i also should probably wash my brushes

1149
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,440
more in fact i recommend everybody while

1150
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,560
you're in quarantine

1151
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,319
wash your makeup brushes we have the

1152
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,359
