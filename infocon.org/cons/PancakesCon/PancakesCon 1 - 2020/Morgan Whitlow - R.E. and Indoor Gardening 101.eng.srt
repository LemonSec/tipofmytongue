1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,080
so

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,920
trying to work on getting audio to

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:31,839
transfer over

4
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,640
maybe using a phone interface yeah

5
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,000
so you can probably hear me because

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
we're still in hangouts but

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,480
uh i'm having an issue sharing your

8
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
audio

9
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:41,839
so still

10
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,120
please bear with us a second folks we

11
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,760
are working on a technical issue

12
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,239
with the audio at this time we'll be

13
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,000
starting here shortly just as soon as we

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:37,840
get that straightened out

15
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,239
one two three all right there's our

16
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,239
audio fantastic

17
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,720
great to have you here all right folks

18
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,239
uh we're about to start with

19
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,360
morgan also known as synaptic rewrite on

20
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
reverse engineering and indoor gardening

21
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,720
101.

22
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,280
uh we have a quick introductory overview

23
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
of reverse engineering including the

24
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,560
difference between debuggers

25
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,200
disassemblers and decompilers and a

26
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,040
discussion of the general workflow and

27
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,440
specialties and sub niches that span the

28
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,519
hardware software spectrum

29
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,959
for gardening the discussion will

30
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,440
include both soil and hydroponic based

31
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,200
gardens to include an instructional

32
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,720
discussion of setting up and caring for

33
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,280
both retail and homemade systems

34
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,360
should time permit there may be a brief

35
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,879
show and tell of several indoor

36
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,720
hydroponic based systems containing

37
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,400
several types of herbs

38
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,120
cherry tomato and pepper plants let me

39
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,239
tell you i'm looking forward to that

40
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:06,959
part

41
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,319
so we have here morgan

42
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,640
with reverse engineering and indoor

43
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,160
gardening 101 over to you

44
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,600
hello hi i'm morgan uh this is my talk

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
reverse engineering 101 in

46
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,199
20 minutes i apologize if i go a little

47
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,479
bit fast

48
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,720
uh this talk is intended to be a very

49
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,479
very baseline

50
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,639
no one uh you've never seen reverse

51
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,680
engineering before

52
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,600
you've only heard the term that type of

53
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,720
thing and you're trying to figure out

54
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,280
what exactly it is and how it works

55
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,960
this is not a talk that will teach you

56
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,639
completely how to do it because that is

57
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,639
not possible in 20 minutes

58
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,919
so let's get started so who even am i

59
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,120
this is who i am

60
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,440
uh the kind of thing my current stuff my

61
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,240
education

62
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
a little bit about my background i'm not

63
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,919
going to go into terrible much detail

64
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,240
here

65
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,919
cause i'm here to talk about reverse

66
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,840
engineering not me

67
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,440
so quick overview we're going to be

68
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,680
talking about human code versus machine

69
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,320
code

70
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,479
the different layers of abstraction so

71
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,560
going from hardware to

72
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,440
more digital more conceptual things like

73
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,680
programs instructions things like that

74
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,840
and that'll let us be able to give a

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,280
better definition of what exactly

76
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,160
reverse engineering

77
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,759
is at that point we'll be able to talk

78
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,840
about static versus dynamic approaches

79
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,120
to reverse engineering and some of the

80
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,440
tools involved there such as ida versus

81
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,400
geytra

82
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,919
and we'll briefly cover some of the

83
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,039
niches and specialties

84
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,240
ah one moment

85
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,440
okay so who speaks what when it comes to

86
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,400
computers

87
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,880
and computers binary is the mother

88
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,919
tongue of machinery

89
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,080
number systems consist of literally ones

90
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,000
and zeros

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,320
when a computer carries out an

92
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,360
instruction

93
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,919
it doesn't see what we see it operates

94
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,240
entirely one versus zero more on that

95
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,039
later

96
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
now binary can also be represented as

97
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,080
hexadecimal

98
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,560
also known as frequently called just hex

99
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,120
that's a base 16 number system that goes

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,560
zero through nine like you're used to

101
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,199
but then also abcdef

102
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,759
uh it's easier to read than binary it's

103
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,360
useful for quickly looking at

104
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
uh specific characters or op codes a lot

105
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,160
of times you'll see it as

106
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,639
two different numbers uh a two-digit

107
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,400
hexadecimal number basically so you

108
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,280
might have like

109
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,800
uh one f or ff or even one

110
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,919
two one zero is actually not binary and

111
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,639
uh is actually not 10 and binary can you

112
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,280
guys still hear me

113
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,960
yes we can okay excellent

114
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,759
so uh hexadecimal when you put it

115
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,479
together

116
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,120
it can be translated into mnemonics so

117
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,199
that's what assembly is

118
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,199
hexadecimal is still technically talking

119
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,560
machine code

120
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,080
but it's a little easier for humans to

121
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,400
see but it doesn't mean anything to us

122
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,560
so if you see an instruction that's like

123
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,319
mov move

124
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,000
that's a mnemonic that's easier for a

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,440
human to understand

126
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,520
so the lowest level human readable

127
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,360
programming language is assembly

128
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,440
that's what gives us processor specific

129
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,599
instructions uh step by step

130
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,800
however because there are different

131
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,720
kinds of processor there can be

132
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,240
different kinds of assembly language

133
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,599
so language levels you have machine code

134
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,199
which is the binary like i was talking

135
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:27,840
about there

136
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,440
that's kind of what it looks like you

137
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,960
get your bits and your bytes and it's

138
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,800
just a string of ones and zeros

139
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,039
that's calculated using a base two

140
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:35,919
binary

141
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,319
numbering system now binary can be

142
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,080
represented as hex

143
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,160
which is what you see there next hello

144
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,759
world

145
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,800
in the two-digit hexadecimal numbers

146
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,319
this leads us to our lower level

147
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,319
assembly languages which end up looking

148
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,280
like this

149
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,479
x86 computers arm tends to be more

150
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,680
embedded devices

151
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,639
phones arduinos all of that kind of

152
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,280
thing

153
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,280
now you'll notice on these small little

154
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,120
clips here that there's different colors

155
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,840
on these

156
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,560
those correspond to the instructions in

157
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,240
the high level language down there

158
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,919
so there's a little piece of source code

159
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,960
in c at the bottom there where include

160
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,599
sdio.h

161
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,680
main all of that that's the human

162
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,360
readable higher level language that's in

163
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,599
c

164
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,639
code now the green end main there

165
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,000
corresponds to the

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,479
green push move on the x86 one or the

167
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,560
push add on the arm one

168
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,639
um this is from a nifty little tool

169
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,000
called godbolt

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,719
um it's actually an interactive online

171
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,679
browser

172
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,839
disassembler more on disassemblers in a

173
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,000
moment

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,958
so moving from physical to abstract we

175
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,080
have our memory

176
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,279
uh we have memory the ram so ram

177
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,959
contains a bunch of matrices it's got

178
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,240
rows and columns

179
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,480
and each one of those has a little cell

180
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,839
each cell can have a positive or

181
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,880
negative charge

182
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
that's where binary comes from as far as

183
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,240
the computer is concerned that's the

184
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,760
ones in the zeros

185
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,440
so the processor reads all the plus and

186
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,600
minus cells like a map or an instruction

187
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,920
booklet so the ones and zeros are data

188
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,959
they're instructions

189
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,040
this is all still on the physical layer

190
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,160
this is something

191
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
physically measurable something you can

192
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,200
actually

193
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,040
not see with the naked eye but you could

194
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,720
see it with appropriate kind of

195
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,040
microscope or instrumentation

196
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,440
so these data or instructions

197
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,399
represented as

198
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,720
charge maps so to speak can be

199
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,399
represented in hexadecimal that's when

200
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,080
we start getting into the more logical

201
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,360
more abstract view of things so this

202
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,120
hexadecimal can be translated into

203
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,160
assembly language

204
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
we have now reached the point to where

205
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,200
you can't see

206
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,839
assembly language on charge necessarily

207
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,600
at least not in a human readable format

208
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,880
but you can see

209
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,800
the representation of it mnemonics

210
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,360
inside a disassembler

211
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,399
so assembly assembly is the compiled

212
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
result of human readable code

213
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,040
so you write hello world in your ide or

214
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,720
in a text document or whatever

215
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,640
you hand it over to the compiler and

216
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,480
then the compiler turns it into assembly

217
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,720
language that can go back down the chain

218
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,760
so how are programs made exactly because

219
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,120
if we don't know how they're made we're

220
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,880
not going to know how to take them and

221
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,320
take them apart

222
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
so human writes something in a high

223
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,200
level language like c or c plus plus

224
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,240
like i said

225
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,800
uh compiler takes that code makes it

226
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
machine readable and spits out the end

227
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,120
result

228
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,360
this is where you get your dot exes your

229
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,519
dot bins dlls things like that

230
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,440
the nice little pre-packaged programs

231
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,959
that you use on a computer without

232
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:29,680
having to

233
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,760
build it yourself that is compiled code

234
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,240
um so that's what the computer takes

235
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,200
because it's just a

236
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,720
cl as far as the computer is concerned

237
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,240
it's just a clumps of instructions and

238
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,200
data

239
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,399
so human human readable code to compiler

240
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,200
assembly

241
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,360
which spits out machine code

242
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,800
so what is reverse engineering

243
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,279
reverse engineering moving backwards is

244
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,800
taking machine code

245
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,640
and tearing it apart in something called

246
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,959
a disassembler it takes that

247
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,240
it takes your exe your binary etc and

248
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,040
it tears it apart and then a and then

249
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,720
the program will do some of this but a

250
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,600
lot of it becomes

251
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,440
manual thing that has to be done by a

252
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,480
human to try and take that disassembly

253
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,920
and make it into something that we

254
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,760
actually um well not necessarily make it

255
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,399
but

256
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,079
shift it into something we understand

257
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,000
better try to figure out how it works

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,680
what the functionality is

259
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,519
if you're trying to change something if

260
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,880
you're trying to fix something

261
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,399
if you're just trying to investigate

262
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,320
something you try to

263
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,079
put it back into ways that you

264
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,560
understand

265
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,920
decompilation is when you take the

266
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,000
code and turn it back into human

267
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,839
readable but we'll go over that again in

268
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:42,640
a moment

269
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,680
so basically ari is trying to figure out

270
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,640
how something works

271
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,839
in human terms by taking that

272
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,959
pre-made compiled binary

273
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,399
and tearing it apart

274
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,839
there are two basic forms of re

275
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,279
dynamic analysis and static analysis

276
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,440
dynamic analysis is sort of like a

277
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,720
vivisection

278
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,000
um you take a file you run it you

279
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,240
actively make it happen now it doesn't

280
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,399
necessarily have to be a file

281
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,200
but it's most commonly going to be most

282
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,800
instances you hear of ari that's what's

283
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
going on

284
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,040
so you basically take it you run it and

285
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,160
then you try to

286
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,399
see what it does this can be done a

287
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,160
couple different ways you can detonate

288
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,000
it in a sandbox or what's known as a

289
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,360
virtual machine

290
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,279
so you take it you sort of section it

291
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,560
off in its own little section of the

292
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,079
computer where it's not going to affect

293
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,519
your operating system it's not going to

294
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,480
break things

295
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,560
this is especially important if you're

296
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,480
use if you're say analyzing a piece of

297
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,560
malware

298
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,639
you run it you observe the behavior you

299
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,160
can use a bunch of different tools

300
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,680
depending on your operating system this

301
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,279
will differ

302
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,200
there are lots of lists of information

303
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,600
out there about that

304
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,920
but you're essentially seeing all right

305
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,200
if i just run this

306
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,600
what happens you could also do this on a

307
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,200
separate physical machine if you had one

308
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,399
that you're willing to be a victim

309
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,440
computer

310
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,000
but do not just run a random file on

311
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,959
your computer

312
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,200
without having some sort of isolation

313
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,440
from the rest of the system

314
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,000
debuggers are another very popular very

315
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,040
common way of

316
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,560
dynamically analyzing things and

317
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,079
generally when you say dynamic analysis

318
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,440
this is what most people are going to

319
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
think of

320
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,279
this is where you take a file and you

321
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,839
run it so you attach to the process so

322
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,079
when you run notepad exe there's

323
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,760
a process that runs that notepad is

324
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,920
you can attach the debugger to that

325
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
process which allows you to do things

326
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,760
like insert breakpoints

327
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,399
a breakpoint basically just says all

328
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:42,880
right

329
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,839
debugger run the file until you get to

330
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,240
this

331
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,560
instruction or this spot in memory and

332
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,000
then stop

333
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,240
not stop as in close the program stop us

334
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,199
and pause

335
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,760
this allows you to see what is in memory

336
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,279
at that time period

337
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,720
that allow which allows you to look at

338
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,839
things such as registers

339
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,240
um it can be risky if you're not careful

340
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,519
because there are still ways for things

341
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,320
to get around

342
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,639
you could also have memory leaks uh

343
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,920
other things that could affect your

344
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
system

345
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,839
sometimes this is nifty to do in a

346
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,519
sandbox as well however

347
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,199
that often will cause compatibility

348
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,120
issues or you won't be able to fully run

349
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,079
it because of

350
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,519
system requirements when dbg is probably

351
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,480
one of the most

352
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,360
popular common famous tools for

353
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,320
debuggers

354
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,000
immunity is another common one and all

355
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,480
adbg is kind of old but it's used in a

356
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,519
lot of

357
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,800
re101 type instructions so if you hear

358
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,240
that one

359
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,360
that's what it is it's a debugger so

360
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,480
static analysis this is what most people

361
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,519
think of when they think

362
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,240
pure software reverse engineering uh you

363
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,000
take a file and you take it apart

364
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,199
without running it

365
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,079
it's a section instead of instead of a

366
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,160
vivisection

367
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,040
so a disassembler takes the binary and

368
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,600
it gives you

369
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,120
assembly so you might drop an exe into a

370
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,600
tool such as ida pro or ghidra or binary

371
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,680
ninja things like that

372
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,560
you drop the binary into it and it looks

373
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,519
through the machine

374
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,720
code and creates what it thinks is the

375
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,839
assembly there

376
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,360
so this will differ based on the

377
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,199
different kind of processor or machine

378
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,720
that it thinks you're running it on or

379
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,040
that

380
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,839
it thinks that it was compiled for and

381
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,279
give you the appropriate

382
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,199
assembly language for it showing you the

383
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,680
different instructions and loops

384
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,560
a decompiler is slightly different

385
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,279
they're often

386
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,560
included with disassemblers but they are

387
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
not exactly the same thing

388
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,880
in this case you'll put in the binary

389
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,759
and you'll get hot

390
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,079
what the this you'll get what the

391
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,440
decompiler thinks

392
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,000
is the higher level code so you might

393
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,839
drop a notepad exe

394
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,759
and it will tell you what kind of what

395
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,240
it thinks the c code looks like

396
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,560
now that sounds that sounds great and

397
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,320
amazing except that

398
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,279
it's the compilers are not perfect and

399
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,600
they

400
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
often are wrong they won't always get it

401
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,759
right which is why disassemblers seem to

402
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,440
be more common because that's a much

403
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,079
more

404
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,079
one-to-one ratio between the

405
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,440
instructions that it's

406
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,800
that the binary has and the instructions

407
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,000
that the machine's actually being told

408
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,639
to carry out

409
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,440
so gidra is the opens guidra

410
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,560
was a tool created by the nsa for

411
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,320
it's actually a framework for reverse

412
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,680
engineering um

413
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,360
recently in the past year or so it

414
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,279
became open source

415
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,480
so you can actually go and you can

416
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,160
download it for free you can play with

417
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,800
it

418
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
uh installing it can be a little bit

419
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
tricky but there are guides for it

420
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,759
it actually comes with its own

421
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,639
documentation it comes with its own

422
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,160
training and classes and it's got a lot

423
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,720
going on

424
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,480
one advantage that it has other than

425
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
being free over ida pro

426
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,639
is that it actually comes with its own

427
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,440
decompiler out the box

428
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,839
so on the side here on the left

429
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,199
screenshot you'll notice towards the

430
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,120
right side basically right under the ra

431
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,919
guidra the little window says decompiler

432
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,199
main

433
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,280
this is the code that it thinks that's

434
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,119
what it thinks the c code looks like

435
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,280
now in this case it's just a hello world

436
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,439
so that's pretty easy to take apart and

437
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,119
that is accurate in this instance um

438
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,959
on the left side in the main window

439
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,240
there you'll you see a bunch of

440
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,280
instructions push

441
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
move lee that's more of that assembly

442
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,959
that i was discussing

443
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,280
uh on the right side underneath the

444
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,799
gydra dragon logo

445
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,640
that's the graph view right now it's

446
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,000
pretty simple because this is just a

447
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,919
hello world and more complex ones it

448
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:36,880
starts having

449
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,360
loops where uh you'll see that box but

450
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,720
you'll also see another one below it and

451
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,760
it'll be linked

452
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,840
you might see a line going back to the

453
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,320
previous box where it goes in loop

454
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,000
this is the most basic example

455
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,440
so ida pro used to be the main uh

456
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,679
tool on the main tool on the market for

457
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,880
disassembly and

458
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,240
by many people is still considered the

459
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,520
gold standard although gatorade has been

460
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,720
catching up

461
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,880
ida since there is a free version that

462
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,240
you can download and it's pretty good

463
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,600
however a lot of its

464
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,760
most powerful functionality is locked

465
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,720
behind a pretty hefty paywall

466
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,640
um so a lot of people never get to use

467
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,559
it never get to use ida pro unless it's

468
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,640
unpaid for by their employer

469
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,480
that being said it's been around for a

470
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,000
little bit longer and it's had a lot

471
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,440
more commercial support it's had a lot

472
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,320
more people

473
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,080
who've poked at it because it's been

474
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,440
more accessible to the public even if

475
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,360
it's been behind that paywall

476
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,000
so a lot of classic reverse engineering

477
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
tutorials and instructions and all that

478
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,160
kind of thing

479
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,760
we'll use ida and that'll be its main

480
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,760
instruction occasionally you'll see ones

481
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,440
that use other things such as binary

482
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,799
ninja or

483
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,960
radar 2 repair pronunciation differs

484
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
but these two tools are the main two

485
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,559
that you usually see when it comes to

486
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,360
reverse engineering

487
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,760
so are you subfields by layer because

488
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,520
reverse engineering what i've mostly

489
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,240
been discussing

490
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,480
now is mostly on the software side which

491
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,679
is what most people think

492
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,919
of when it comes to reverse engineering

493
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,120
now a lot of this

494
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,919
also very much covers and encompasses

495
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:04,880
firmware

496
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,520
firmware is essentially the software

497
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,320
that

498
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,360
interfaces with the hardware layer there

499
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,960
is such a thing as hardware already as

500
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,600
well

501
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,200
so these are some general lineage but

502
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,120
not some heart not hard definitions

503
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,799
because no one really

504
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,200
firmly agrees i'm not intended on what

505
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,120
exactly firmware is

506
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,039
uh some people think that it's the

507
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,160
driver some people think it's the

508
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
bootloader some people think it's

509
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,919
the information in read-only memory

510
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,520
things like that that gets to be

511
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,000
really very fuzzy even on the hardware

512
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,679
side some people still view that as

513
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,120
software so when peop when people say

514
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,679
that oh

515
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,799
they do software or firmware or hardware

516
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,240
these are the kinds of things that i

517
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,400
generally tend to see them specializing

518
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,240
in my personal experience

519
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,679
some people will probably agree with me

520
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,960
and they will probably have completely

521
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,240
valid points but

522
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,679
the whole point here is that they're

523
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,600
fuzzy overlapping boundaries

524
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,640
no one fully agrees on it but this is

525
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,840
generally a really vague idea of

526
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,600
what we're talking about when we use

527
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,320
these different terms within re

528
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,200
so another way that re is often commonly

529
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,080
broken out is by target

530
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,919
traditional computers is a very common

531
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,240
one this would also encompass a lot of

532
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,159
the web app type stuff

533
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,880
however embedded devices tends to be its

534
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,799
own

535
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,080
sub niche on a macro scale almost of

536
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,039
re targets because someone who does re

537
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,280
for a phone or a vehicle

538
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,159
may not have a great idea of how the

539
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,240
assembly language or how the

540
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,240
structure and processes work for

541
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,080
traditional computer re

542
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,559
uh malware is also its own special type

543
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,720
and this can also fall into computers or

544
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
embedded devices because

545
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,159
malware can be found on either one

546
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,400
usually it's looking at computers but

547
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,760
mobile malware has been becoming a

548
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,520
bigger thing over time

549
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,799
um signals and protocols these are

550
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,799
sometimes gripped into re as well but

551
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,640
not what most people think

552
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,679
rf rfre is amazing but these

553
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,640
those people are insanely smart uh if

554
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,400
not just insane but

555
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,480
that's reversing the actual radio

556
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,320
signals to try and find the protocols

557
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,080
that it's carried on and how that kind

558
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,280
of thing works

559
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,799
a lot of times there's a lot of overlap

560
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,559
with people who do just straight up

561
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,440
network reverse engineering uh so those

562
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,840
that's a general idea of

563
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,559
how rd's broken down based off of layer

564
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,840
and based off of target

565
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
um that's

566
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,960
the general gist of things so if there's

567
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,720
questions comments on

568
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
uh reverse engineering at this point

569
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,240
after this i'll be switching to the

570
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,960
gardening talk

571
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,559
uh we can just put all the questions at

572
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,720
the end uh there are a few of them but

573
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,799
do you have any questions

574
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,480
there there are some questions but uh

575
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:59,840
we'll keep them for the end

576
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,520
can you hear me one moment

577
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,158
okay i'm going to switch over to my

578
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
camera

579
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,960
hello

580
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,840
all right

581
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,559
ah questions for the end i've just been

582
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,799
informed all right excellent

583
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,600
well so gardening 101

584
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,640
i do actually have two slides

585
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,600
well one slide basically for this so

586
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,880
there's a couple different ways that you

587
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,159
can do gardening inside

588
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,400
first off is to know what your you can

589
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,280
do that in

590
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,360
soil or you can do it in water but we'll

591
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,880
get to that more in a moment

592
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,159
because first we're going to be talking

593
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,640
about plants needs plants have different

594
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,280
kinds

595
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,360
of needs obviously we all learn this in

596
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,120
kindergarten plants need light they need

597
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,600
water

598
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,919
they need air and usually you hear that

599
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,080
they need soil but to be more specific

600
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,600
they need nutrients and they need

601
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,240
support um

602
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,039
so for potted plants for soil plants you

603
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,000
basically have

604
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,360
your pot which can take a bunch of

605
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,000
different forms

606
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,440
planters they can be a plastic container

607
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,880
it can be a terracotta pot

608
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,640
they need dirt for the soil based ones

609
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,360
water

610
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,360
light light can take a different a few

611
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,720
different forms if you have a sunny

612
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,320
window that can be useful

613
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,520
if you have a porch or a balcony that

614
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,440
can be effective if you get enough sun

615
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,880
however a lot of times you're just going

616
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,720
to have to rely on putting your light on

617
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,279
it

618
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,440
now sometimes a nice bright white light

619
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,799
will work depending on the spectrum

620
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,279
however you can get special plant lights

621
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,720
you'll notice that they're sort of

622
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,400
purple and

623
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,919
oftentimes they'll be leds that are

624
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,679
purple and blue i highly recommend the

625
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,200
leds over the

626
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,799
bulb style just because of the fact that

627
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,440
um the leds won't get quite as hot and

628
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,200
they're much more energy efficient

629
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
which is useful especially if it's

630
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,480
really close to the plant because it's

631
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,520
less likely that you'll burn the leaves

632
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,880
um all right so that

633
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,360
discusses light water generally tap

634
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,799
water will work just fine most of the

635
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,480
time if you have especially hard water

636
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,039
or you have

637
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,120
plant that needs a special amount of

638
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,960
acidity or something like that

639
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,240
you might have to do some sort of

640
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,919
treatment that gets a little bit more

641
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,679
specialized for beginner level

642
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,520
tap water is fine if you really want to

643
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,880
get fancy

644
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,200
start looking into your specific plants

645
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
that you're growing

646
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,799
so air we all learned in kindergarten or

647
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,000
at least a lot of us did that

648
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,279
plants take in co2 they put out oxygen

649
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,400
your plants still need other trace gases

650
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,679
in certain amounts

651
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,679
but that's not as important however it's

652
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,799
the roots and

653
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,960
leaves that tend to need air so if you

654
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,000
have really dense

655
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
soil or you keep your plant wet all the

656
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,320
time the droots will start to rot it'll

657
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,200
drown

658
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,720
depending on the plants some plants

659
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,799
really love water some plants really

660
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,400
need to be dry

661
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,039
that's plant specific a lot of the

662
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,080
plants that you'll get at home

663
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
depot or from a general gardening store

664
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,760
that say they're indoor plants

665
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,960
are usually fairly forgiving um but a

666
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,320
lot of times they'll have a special

667
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,039
potting soil such as

668
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,000
uh miracle grow potting soil mix that'll

669
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,240
have

670
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,080
gel beads in them or just be made of a

671
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,840
certain mix that's much more moisture

672
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,399
absorbent

673
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,080
and a lot of times it will have

674
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,320
fertilizer built into it now after a

675
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,240
while the soil will be depleted or if

676
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,039
like if you use

677
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,799
soil from your yard after a while your

678
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,559
plants might start to turn pale or a

679
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,919
certain color of yellow or something

680
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:48,720
like that

681
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,440
that might mean that they need nutrients

682
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,200
you can pick up fertilizer mix

683
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,559
from again home depot amazon any place

684
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,520
that sells gardening supplies

685
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,320
essentially

686
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,080
uh if you really really want to start

687
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,520
geeking out on things you can actually

688
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,120
start making your own plant mix if

689
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,320
you're truly trying to optimize

690
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,520
the quality of your plants

691
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,440
and then support so the amount of

692
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,080
support a plant requires varies wildly

693
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,918
um one second

694
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,559
some plants will be very tall and very

695
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,320
spindly and you might have to put what's

696
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,440
called a trellis

697
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,120
essentially it's scaffolding for the

698
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,559
plant uh

699
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,880
vines especially tend to be like that

700
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,400
where they will grow and they'll wrap

701
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,720
around things to try and climb upwards

702
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,000
this is what you'll usually see on a

703
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,600
fence in this case the fence is the

704
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,799
trellis

705
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,559
however plants that just grow straight

706
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,840
up like say

707
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,200
a dandelion or a succulent or something

708
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,679
like that

709
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,360
they basically just need some soil that

710
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,200
they can dig their roots into and stay

711
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,480
upright

712
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,320
plants that you see in the little glass

713
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,840
balls hanging in stores

714
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,600
air plants they don't really require

715
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,880
much support at all

716
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,720
uh they tend to hang out in trees that's

717
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
also what a lot of moss and spanish moss

718
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,080
and things like that are

719
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,039
um so those those are the base five

720
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,400
basic needs for a plant

721
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,320
light water air nutrients support

722
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,000
all right so for hydroponics

723
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,360
uh light water and air they're about the

724
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:17,919
same

725
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,520
nutrients are a little bit different

726
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,240
because in hydroponics you can't have

727
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,000
certain kinds of you can't have ammonia

728
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,520
because your plants still going to need

729
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,840
nitrogen but the ammonia

730
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,679
doesn't get broken down by the bacteria

731
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,200
in the soil so

732
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,559
if you're using for the layman all this

733
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,279
really means

734
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,200
is if you're going to be giving a

735
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,279
fertilizer to a plant to a hydroponic

736
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:41,679
plant

737
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,799
just make sure it's a hydroponic

738
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,159
fertilizer that's all you really have to

739
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,320
do

740
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,200
that does mean that if you're using you

741
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,640
might not necessarily be able to use the

742
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
same fertilizer that you use for a

743
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,240
potted plant um

744
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,720
the containers tend to be a little bit

745
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,320
different can be a little bit different

746
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,679
for hydroponics

747
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,440
so the most basic hydroponic system in

748
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,240
the world

749
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,760
looks like this

750
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,399
this is a coffee mug with a succulent

751
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,080
that i stuck into it

752
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,520
so you can see the roots that are

753
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,279
growing at the bottom here

754
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,200
i i moved into this apartment

755
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,279
probably a month and a half ago this is

756
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,880
a large plant that i actually have

757
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,760
outside on the balcony uh this little

758
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,279
piece had broken off but i didn't want

759
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,520
to lose it so i just took it and i stuck

760
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,480
it in water

761
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,320
now if i leave this in here eventually i

762
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,000
will need to add some nutrients to it

763
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,440
however at the moment

764
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,039
it seems to be doing just fine because

765
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,880
none of those roots the little white

766
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,240
hairs here are the roots

767
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,039
existed when i put this in the cup first

768
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,640
but now after a couple weeks

769
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
it's starting to grow nicely one of the

770
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,000
nice things about doing this

771
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,080
is then if i i can either keep it

772
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,200
hydroponic

773
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,799
or i can fill sorry or i can fill a

774
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,080
container with dirt

775
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,120
and plant it into it

776
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
uh for a demo in a moment i'm going to

777
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,240
be showing how to

778
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,039
transplant a oregano plant to a larger

779
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:07,760
container

780
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,840
so taking something smaller because

781
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,039
plants

782
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,640
there's technically one more need they

783
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,080
need space

784
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,799
uh some plants will be most definitively

785
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,480
sized they only grow to a certain size

786
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,520
they don't get any bigger some will

787
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,720
continually grow and grow and grow

788
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,039
throughout their lifetime

789
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,559
but generally a lot of times you start

790
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,919
with smaller plant it gets bigger over

791
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,159
time

792
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,640
so this means at some point you have to

793
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,440
repot a plant

794
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,559
all right just checking time so

795
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,559
a couple different ways of getting said

796
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,240
plants one you can buy a plant at the

797
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,279
store

798
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,360
two you can grow a plant from seed you

799
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,039
can order seeds online you can pick them

800
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,679
up from the store

801
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,760
they will come in many different sizes

802
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,360
and shapes so for example here are some

803
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,799
basil seeds

804
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,399
uh many different braids

805
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,799
a little fuzzy but you can also

806
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,880
take what's known as a cutting from an

807
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,080
existing plant

808
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,679
now this works better for some species

809
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,360
than for others

810
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,679
this for example is a cutting that i

811
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,640
took from

812
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,240
a plant that i have this is actually

813
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,000
from a loofah plant you know the loofah

814
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,440
sponges you use in the bath

815
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,520
those are actually gourds they grow on

816
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,279
vines they grow on a vine plant i've got

817
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,880
it growing in the back

818
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,240
if there's enough time i will show in a

819
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,559
moment so basically i took

820
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,159
this was getting a little long and

821
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,240
unruly so i took a pair of scissors and

822
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,200
i cut it

823
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,799
when you do this i highly

824
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,120
so you have your plant

825
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,440
with my beautiful artwork here

826
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,840
and it's growing into whatever

827
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,760
and it's a lot of times it'll have

828
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,200
little branches off

829
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,000
and they'll have tiny leaves so

830
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,159
you don't want to cut it here for your

831
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,120
cutting usually

832
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,960
you can but a lot of times that'll be

833
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,360
too narrow to steep whatever

834
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,399
you want to go for the newer growth

835
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,120
so if the stem

836
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,480
if you've figured out which one you want

837
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
and this is a zoomed in section of the

838
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,080
stem this goes towards

839
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,000
the main body of the plant this is just

840
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,799
a bunch of leaves

841
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,799
you want to try and cut it at an angle

842
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:29,840
not straight

843
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,720
perpendicular with it but at a slight

844
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,279
angle

845
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,440
diagonal that will help it grow and help

846
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,960
it absorb water easier

847
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,440
it'll have greater surface area along

848
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,000
this cut

849
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,679
so you probably can't see it very well

850
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,080
on this

851
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,679
but in any case once you have your

852
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,360
cutting you can get a bottle of what's

853
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,720
known as rooting powder which is just

854
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,360
hormone

855
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,039
or you can just stick it in water

856
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,480
reading hormone will help make it more

857
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,240
likely it will grow roots but not

858
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,279
necessarily guaranteed so basically

859
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,320
you'll just stick it in water so i'm

860
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,080
hoping that in a week or two

861
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,000
this will have roots have started to

862
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,200
sprout some roots similar to the way

863
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,760
this one did

864
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,480
so hydroponics there's a couple this is

865
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,919
the most basic kind

866
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,000
it's a cup with water it does not get

867
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,200
more simple than that

868
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,159
uh you've probably seen some uh seen

869
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,519
someone who had like an avocado with

870
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,440
sticks in it sitting on a cup of water

871
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,960
that's what this is they're trying to

872
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,480
sprout the seed

873
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,320
you can transplant hydroponic things in

874
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,679
the soil and a lot of times they'll take

875
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,159
well

876
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,279
which is why a lot of times these are

877
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,159
used for starters

878
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,480
however in the interests of time i'm

879
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,200
going to

880
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,120
quickly show some of the hydroponic

881
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,559
systems i have that are

882
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,360
a little more complicated so in a basic

883
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,960
hydroponic system you can just do the

884
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,480
water however if you're looking for an

885
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,279
active one you add a pump into it and

886
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,440
the pump will push the water up to

887
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,919
wherever the plant is and then trickle

888
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:56,720
back down

889
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,279
into the basin of water so it ends up

890
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,320
looking something

891
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,799
like this

892
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,480
so tub of water

893
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,639
goes up to the container with the plant

894
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,880
water goes in water drains back down

895
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,840
this is what's known as an ebb and flow

896
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,320
system

897
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,279
there's another type where you just have

898
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,480
the container of

899
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,399
water and you have a raft on it

900
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,960
that the plant just floats on

901
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,880
and then air and then there's an air

902
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,320
stone like you see in a fish aquarium

903
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,120
that just bubbles up air

904
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,120
and the plant just floats on top of the

905
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,519
water level that's what's known as dwc

906
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,200
deepwater current

907
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,919
so let's look at some actual fancier

908
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:56,480
ones

909
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
the d that's how you would do a diy

910
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,600
system i

911
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,200
actually happen to have what are known

912
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,360
as aerogardens

913
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,039
these are retail systems

914
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,719
and they come in different sizes

915
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,839
aerogarden as a brand

916
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,839
[Music]

917
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,119
so

918
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,000
these are cherry tomatoes now you'll

919
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,520
notice that they are all sort of

920
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
jammed in there that goes back to the

921
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,280
space thing

922
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,960
so they're crowding each other out a

923
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,320
little bit because i actually

924
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,960
went to the store and i bought some

925
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,159
physical

926
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,839
sorry i bought some normal in the dirt

927
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,520
cherry tomatoes because

928
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,800
i have this much larger farm system here

929
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,320
that the uh cloth is on

930
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,079
if you buy the aerogarden brand or you

931
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,440
are a little more careful you can get

932
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,040
ones that are smaller however since i

933
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,719
had the space i decided to

934
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,839
run an experiment and make a little

935
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,320
larger one these

936
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,400
are some peppers if you're wondering

937
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,440
about the

938
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,359
about the bars that is to keep my cats

939
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,839
from eating

940
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,480
okay and you can see some rosemary

941
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,240
plants in there as well so those

942
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,240
rosemaries were actually

943
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,000
ones that i got from the grocery store

944
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,760
so sometimes if you go to the grocery

945
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,560
store you'll see

946
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,760
live herbs in the uh produce

947
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,200
refrigerable section

948
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,119
that actually have roots you can just

949
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,720
take those and you can plant them into

950
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,160
the ground or you can plant them into a

951
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,359
hydroponic system

952
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,040
i recommend doing it quickly after you

953
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,880
get them because otherwise the roots

954
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
could start to rot or go bad

955
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,240
transplant shock is also a thing so

956
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,079
these are a couple of smaller aerogarden

957
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,800
systems so there's two of them here

958
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,599
this one is full of a bunch of different

959
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,720
kinds of herbs

960
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,960
so we've got some basil back here we've

961
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,000
got some

962
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,359
thyme and mint a few other things and

963
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,240
some lettuce there

964
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,359
trying to get the angle here so you can

965
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,000
see that they have the light at the top

966
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,760
those little icons are the status

967
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,000
indicators and inside

968
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,680
let me set the computer down so i can

969
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,160
show and inside here

970
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,760
is actually a pump

971
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,280
where you put where you pour in the

972
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,480
water and all the roots grow

973
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,720
so those white strings those are

974
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,079
actually the roots you can actually see

975
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,640
the shine from the water level there

976
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,440
now i'm just going to very briefly

977
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,320
glance at

978
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,079
the loofah plant and then i'm going to

979
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,160
show the hallway form

980
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,839
so this is a lufo plant

981
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,079
and anywhere in probably a few months or

982
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:42,400
so

983
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
it will hopefully be growing large

984
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,040
gourds that would be luffa's lunches

985
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,400
now remember when i was talking about

986
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,079
support before

987
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,359
i've actually put uh an old

988
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,560
lacy uh scarf type thing that i got from

989
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,839
a thrift store here

990
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,200
because i'm going to use that as a

991
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,720
makeshift trellis because notice that

992
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,440
this is nice and long and spindly

993
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,800
these little curly cues here that's

994
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,040
because this is a vine these actually

995
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,839
try to

996
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,400
grow in and around things and it pulls

997
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,040
the plant

998
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,119
up it naturally tries to lift itself

999
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,400
however since i've got it in this

1000
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,480
container without anything attached to

1001
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,839
it it doesn't work

1002
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,400
if i leave it like this however it will

1003
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,800
eventually start to attach itself

1004
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,440
all right one more garden really fast

1005
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,359
so one of the main issues that i've had

1006
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,040
with trying to grow things indoor is

1007
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,160
actually pets

1008
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,680
my cats apparently love salads

1009
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,440
um so we've actually had to do things

1010
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,200
such as attach a piece of

1011
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,640
plastic sorry put a piece of plexiglass

1012
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,440
on the front of the garden so basically

1013
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,400
did this with a pair

1014
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,720
with a set of magnets because the frame

1015
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,680
of this one

1016
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,160
is metal however you could also zip tie

1017
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,280
something to attach it

1018
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,599
do other things so these are some more

1019
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,880
pepper plants

1020
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,560
eventually they will need trellises like

1021
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,680
the others however at the moment

1022
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,800
at the moment they are fairly sturdy

1023
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,040
however going back to that crowding and

1024
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,480
light thing they can easily be crowded

1025
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:14,800
out

1026
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,880
this is a thai hot pepper plant that my

1027
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,119
cats actually pulled out of the garden

1028
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,119
and ate and we had to put back in

1029
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,400
however that provides a nice way to show

1030
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,440
how roots work so

1031
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,560
we got our support we got our plant

1032
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,079
it's all good on the other side we have

1033
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,680
a burgeoning lettuce patch

1034
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,359
trying to get it in the shot that this

1035
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,319
only goes so far back

1036
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,079
all right so lettuce is a little

1037
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:46,800
different it

1038
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,560
doesn't mind the crowding quite so badly

1039
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,079
although i apparently need to make a

1040
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,280
salad because this is pretty thin

1041
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,359
these are just some chives in the front

1042
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,359
uh anyway i think i've reached the point

1043
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,240
to where i'm ready for

1044
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,839
questions

1045
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,839
um

1046
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,320
okay any questions

1047
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,720
uh there are a few can you hear me

1048
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,680
no we may have to breathe um

1049
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,440
since we are having some audio visual i

1050
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,680
don't think i see them however

1051
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
i'd like to thank everyone for listening

1052
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,279
uh oh sorry do have a question

1053
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,760
do you compile ransomware's strain uh

1054
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,200
decompiling would be ari um

1055
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,480
i can absolutely recommend some open

1056
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
source learning links for re uh ping me

1057
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,839
in the slack and i will

1058
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,440
start putting together a list from a

1059
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,359
workshop that i did a while back

1060
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,480
um plant zones are not so important if

1061
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,520
growing indoors

1062
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,040
their environment is your environment or

1063
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,560
the one that you give them

1064
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,560
closer to windows closer to a window is

1065
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,680
a little different because then it can

1066
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,680
be colder warmed from it

1067
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,920
uh resources for hydroponic systems i

1068
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,000
can also totally do that again hit me up
