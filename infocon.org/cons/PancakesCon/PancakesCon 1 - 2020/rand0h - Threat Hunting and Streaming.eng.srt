14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,480

16

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,120
i cannot tell you how excited i was like

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,600
after

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,120
doing the moderation here to see that i

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,199

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,199

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,080
powerhouse of a talk um

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,320
and uh danny's a personal friend

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,439
outstanding dude

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,200
i mean if you don't know him um you're

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,640
missing out um

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,000
that next time we're all together at a

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,400
con uh hopefully coronavirus free

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,960
uh give him a bit bear hug because uh he

40
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,400
is seriously just he's

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,920
become a pillar of the absolute pillar

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,040
of the community so um and well you can

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
and you can definitely rate that like

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,640
you know jake a lot of times people like

45
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,920
this guy does a lot for the community or

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,600
this lady does a lot for the community

47
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,920
and they give talks and that's great but

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,960
really for me

49
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,119
one of the bellwethers is what do they

50
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,079
give up in their free

51
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,079
time and danny with the 24 hour marathon

52
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,159
the uh who slide is it anyway which we

53
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,040
will refuse to hold against him

54
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,880
in this particular situation there's

55
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,479
just a tremendous amount of things that

56
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,840
he doesn't have to do

57
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,000
it's not part of his job and he's out

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,680
there doing it anyway and that's just

59
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,640
amazing oh yeah hacker game show at uh

60
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,320

68
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,560

danny akosky you guys can follow me

85
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,560
uh at diakoski uh on twitter

86
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,959
after the uh amazingly overblown intro i

87
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,080
don't know if i can live up to that but

88
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,519
i'm sure you're gonna try

89
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,200
um so yeah i decided i saw the

90
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
i saw the abstract come up uh or the the

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,840
the call for papers come up for pancakes

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,720
con and

93
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,680
holy getting this uh ready in three

94
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,640
days

95
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,599
is just a monumental thing so i

96
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,599
literally wrote the abstract for this

97
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,120
talk and got the idea

98
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,680
while i was in the kitchen uh and i

99
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,200
wrote the abstract and submitted before

100
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,879
my mac and cheese was done that is a

101
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,840
true story

102
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,239
um hunched over trying to type on my

103
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,239
phone while my cat's butt is like going

104
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:34,959
back and forth

105
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,599
in front of me so um hopefully it's

106
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,799
something interesting

107
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,920
uh for any threat hunters in uh in the

108
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,360
chat uh people that are

109
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,159
watching if you are if you are the david

110
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,920
biancos of the world if you're the paul

111
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,519
nelsons of the world uh this stuff is

112
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,040
going to seem really rudimentary but for

113
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,920
those who have no

114
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,480
idea about it i really geared the first

115
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,159
half of this talk

116
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,040
for people that uh might be looking to

117
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,319
get into the industry

118
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,720
and you have so many different options

119
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,599
you have

120
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,519
uh you might just want to you know break

121
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,200
stuff and be the bad guy and

122
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,120
be a filthy red teamer like john strand

123
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,720
or you know jake williams

124
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,080
um then you you'll want to do red team

125
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,000
and study those kinds of things but

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,120
um some of us like i fell into threat

127
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,759
hunting

128
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,160
uh by complete accident i started

129
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,199
working at mandiant

130
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,720
uh and just i it must have been like

131
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,120
karmic lottery that i the first person

132
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
that i ever worked for

133
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,600
was david bianco who is if you haven't

134
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,199
followed him if you are interested in

135
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,080
threat hunting

136
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,280
uh he is the guy like he's a dude he's

137
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,840
who you want to follow

138
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,280
um and i'll show a couple of his slide

139
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,800
decks which i now owe him

140
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,960
uh residual money for but that's all

141
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,080
right uh

142
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,120
so and then that's just kind

143
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,080
i fell into that whole defensive end of

144
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,680
the business and just stayed in

145
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,600
at a certain point i was like ah maybe i

146
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
want to try something new

147
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,039
but really this is what i'm good at and

148
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,639
this is what i've done for

149
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,880
the past eight years so i figured i

150
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,720
would give those of you who are at kind

151
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
of that crossroads or that entry point

152
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,320
into your careers

153
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,840
an idea of like do i really want to do

154
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,680
this like what's involved in it

155
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,919
um how do i do this on my own right a

156
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,320
big portion of this first 20 minutes

157
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
is how do i do this on my own at home uh

158
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,919
especially because

159
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,360
all of us are on lockdown now um

160
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,120

162
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,600

168
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,919
after that once you get good right or

169
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,120
even

170
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,440
not even after you get good even after

171
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,160
you

172
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,639
are just hunting and pecking and

173
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,199
guessing

174
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,320
and cursing maybe you want to tell other

175
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,520
people about it i am a huge proponent

176
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,520
of um writing blogs making content

177
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,639
uh john mentioned my 24 hour streams

178
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,479
uh which is basically the twitch

179
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,000
equivalent of a stunt hack

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,440
um of being up forever and doing

181
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,560
uh it started out as uh 24 hours of hack

182
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,360
the box

183
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,280
and i know nothing like some i'm a blue

184
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,560
teamer so let me

185
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,880
mess with this once you learn all of

186
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,240
these things

187
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,960
how do you share it right and i think

188
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,639
now more than ever

189
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,919
it's drastically increased the need

190
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,520
for communication especially video

191
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,199
communication people

192
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,960
learn differently people

193
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,560
might like to just read things or they

194
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,400
need a face

195
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,479
preferably not my face but maybe

196
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,840
somebody better looking

197
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,919
uh like leslie to teach them things so

198
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,720
twitch streaming has been exponentially

199
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,280
uh

200
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,840
uh valuable for me and to the people who

201
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,720
i want

202
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
to relay that information to but anyway

203
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,120
uh again this is what happens when i

204
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,639
don't write anything from my talk

205
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,160
i just pontificate so we're going to do

206
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,319
a little bit of intro thread hunting

207
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,080
and streaming on twitch.tv so

208
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,440
let's get started on the hunt portion

209
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,960
literally threw these things together

210
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,680
last night so i do this with a random

211
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,240
microsoft template uh i want anybody

212
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,680
who's watching this

213
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,080
mad lib what this timeline timeline

214
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,599
might be about

215
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,800
uh uh at me on twitter at the iacotsky

216
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,479
with your best caption

217
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,080
and the winning caption gets a free year

218
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,520
of hack the box vip

219
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,599
from me um just because i thought that

220
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,560
would be fun

221
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,720
so what do you think this timeline is

222
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,759
actually showing

223
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,840
i'll leave that up for a couple seconds

224
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,199
at diakoski

225
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,560
uh impress me and you'll get to uh

226
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,479
be uh you get to break stuff on hack the

227
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,759
box for a whole year on me

228
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,440
so what is thread hunting right

229
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,360
everybody asks that question uh

230
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,319
it is the it was the marketing du jour

231
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:54,879
for

232
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,919
such a long time uh it was in every

233
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,759
vendor email that you got

234
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,800
and everybody has a different definition

235
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,879
right everybody's gonna give you their

236
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,639
different opinion of what threat hunting

237
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,080
is and they're gonna say it

238
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,680
over and over and over again

239
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,199
and uh i hear it and i don't care

240
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,879
there's there's so many different

241
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,800
definitions like everybody is like

242
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,000
uh some people lean heavily towards it's

243
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,919
just it just means host right you're

244
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,280
only hunting

245
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,960
on the end point and that's all that

246
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,720
matters network doesn't matter

247
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,879
uh it's amazing still in this day and

248
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,240
age how many people

249
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,719
kind of shove aside the whole networking

250
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,159
end of things

251
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,640
or they have you know hunting is just

252
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,320
bug hunting it's just

253
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,000
you know doing stuff for hacker one it's

254
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,839
it's everybody's got a different

255
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,880
definition and uh it's a

256
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,279
such a pain in the ass conversation to

257
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:49,920
have

258
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,440
because a lot of smart people are having

259
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,560
it and they all have different ways of

260
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,680
describing it

261
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,040
i describe it very very simply and

262
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,519
funny enough or in a slack room and i

263
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,640
have a bot

264
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
and a bot every time somebody asks

265
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,880
somebody to define thread hunting

266
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,600
it just says gtfo so that's how much we

267
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,080
hate this

268
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,880
question i will boil it down very very

269
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,440
simply

270
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,560
right uh finding ways for evil

271
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,680
to do evil things but even that doesn't

272
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,920
do it justice because

273
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
that will say that you're always going

274
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,519
to find evil when you're hunting for

275
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,160
threats

276
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,080
and that's not always the case right

277
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,519
sometimes it's just going to be

278
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,920
hold on i have my timer on my other

279
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,560
laptop

280
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,240
and now it open up

281
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,959
it's not always going to be evil right

282
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,240
you're not always hunting

283
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,440
for looking for that big red flag waving

284
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,360
right you're not always going to find

285
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,240
evil there are so many other benefits to

286
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,640
this

287
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,720
it's getting to know your network right

288
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,800
it's getting to figure out

289
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,880
uh stuff that's there that you've never

290
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,600
even seen before i did a lot of the gigs

291
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,760
when i was a consultant at mandiant of

292
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,959
people finding out

293
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,360
like developer workstations that were

294
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,160
live

295
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,120
on the internet uh that some dev just

296
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,680
spun up

297
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,519
because you know we all know developers

298
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,959
are always super into

299
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,120
security and consider that before they

300
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,800
stick a machine on the internet

301
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,279
um and this is one of those byproducts

302
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,279
right you can get really get to know

303
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,320
your network you can really get to

304
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,360
because you don't know what you're

305
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
defending if you don't know what's out

306
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,480
there and you don't know what's

307
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,200
important

308
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,279
if you don't know what's out there we

309
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,720
talk in the threat hunting

310
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,640
space a lot about finding those crown

311
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,320
jewels right finding

312
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,640
those things that are really important

313
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,760
to you

314
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,519
so man i have talked a lot already

315
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,880
really boils down to the holy trinity of

316
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,720
what to do with threat hunting right you

317
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,079
need your data

318
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,640
right you need the stuff coming in you

319
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,880
need somewhere to put it

320
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,360
and you need some way to look at it

321
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,560
right those are

322
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,600
as as basic as i can put that down is

323
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,160
those are your three absolute

324
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,000
requirements right you need something to

325
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,720
look at it

326
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,320
you need some kind of storage whether

327
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,640
that be something like a

328
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,079
um hadoop cluster or uh just

329
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,120
getting logs uh folded into splunk

330
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,920
uh and um then they all sit there and

331
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,240
then

332
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,839
some some way to look at somebody to

333
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,279
analyze it and just figure out what's

334
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,279
going on

335
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,079
but why like why why would we do all

336
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:24,480
that

337
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,200
right what is the actual point of all

338
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,519
that

339
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,440
to talk about that we have to talk about

340
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,959
what do you even look for

341
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,279
right i mentioned i owe david bianco

342
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,200
residuals every time i use these

343
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,160
uh this uh you'll see in the upper left

344
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,560
the

345
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,120
thread hunting loop created uh by david

346
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,320
when he was a squirrel

347
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,600
and his always timeless uh

348
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,920
pyramid of pain right these will kind of

349
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,560
get your brain working

350
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,800
of why you do these kinds of things and

351
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,600
even for me i've been doing this for man

352
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,160
i don't like

353
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,560
i said about eight years now security

354
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,279
proper

355
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,440
and i can still sit down in front of my

356
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,480
console

357
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,600
and say well

358
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,839
and you know we will get a new client

359
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,920
and i'll be like all right well

360
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,399
now what i still do that i still do that

361
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,519
after eight years

362
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,440
because every data set is going to be

363
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,399
different so you can't rely

364
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,120
on just knowing or you can't rely on

365
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,000
just

366
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
this is super important and and i don't

367
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,440
want to understate this for anybody

368
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,639
because the point of this first half of

369
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,880
this conversation is to

370
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,440
um uh drive the point home for people

371
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,079
that are just

372
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,959
getting into this right no matter how

373
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,600
far you

374
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,920
go in this and i just realized this in

375
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,040
like the past year

376
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,880
because i always beat myself up for not

377
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,480
knowing every little thing

378
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,959
and not knowing every little eventuality

379
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,959
and knowing every threat and

380
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,880
iteration of this that and everything

381
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,480
it's not about knowing that stuff it's

382
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,120
about

383
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,560
asking questions that's the big dirty

384
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,440
secret

385
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,320
if you can ask a question one question

386
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,440
leads to another

387
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,560
and to another it's like going on a

388
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,920
it's like being on youtube right we're

389
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,360
all home now we're all freaked out and

390
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,880
we're all finding stuff to do and you go

391
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,360
down

392
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,120
those like youtube holes or those

393
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,600
wikipedia holes we've all done that

394
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,040
hunting is the same thing it is asking

395
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
one question and that usually starts

396
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,200
with like what data do i have

397
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,040
and then you look at it and you say oh i

398
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,680
have some http logs coming in or i have

399
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,360
dns logs coming in

400
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,079
cool let me just look at it and just ask

401
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:32,959
questions

402
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,120
one of the things that i i love to do

403
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,040
when i'm i write a lot i

404
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,800
i uh luckily i get to give a lot of

405
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,880
talks and do a lot of blogs and

406
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,279
things like that and when i am stuck

407
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,279
absolutely stuck happens more often than

408
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,079
you think

409
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,279
uh of trying to figure out how to what

410
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,399
to write like what

411
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,720
i just do stream of consciences and it

412
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,440
is literally me typing in sublime text

413
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,560
i have no effing idea what i'm doing i

414
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,360
don't know

415
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,839
how i'm gonna write about this what even

416
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,519
matters about this thing

417
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,199
well i it's literally a conversation

418
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,279
with myself well this thing might matter

419
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,880
and this thing might be cool and before

420
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,600
i know it

421
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,160
just typing out that stream of ranting

422
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,040
uh you know

423
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,760
like rantings of a post-burnout psycho

424
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,680
uh which is literally the banner on my

425
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,480
blog site

426
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,440
um and then eventually i start getting

427
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,880
somewhere and i start thinking and then

428
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,320
i start pivoting and i start

429
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,720
going back into my tool so it all starts

430
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,120
with asking those questions right

431
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,440
so threat hunting loop uh and uh we'll

432
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,399
just kind of

433
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,680
it really boils all that down into uh

434
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,040
create a hypothesis use some tools um

435
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,480
uh uh uh uncover patterns right this is

436
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,160
what this is all about

437
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,720
and i gotta move along really quick uh

438
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,160
so how do you do that right how do you

439
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,279
do that from home

440
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,560
how do you learn this stuff uh elk

441
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,639
elk stash uh this is just one of many

442
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,240
things right people say i like this

443
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,760
thing and i like this thing

444
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,600
this is for those just getting into this

445
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,199
right uh

446
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,680
go look up elks dash it has everything

447
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,040
it has

448
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,800
where where to get you have to supply

449
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,240
your own data right and i'll get to that

450
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,880
in a second

451
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,760
but somewhere to put it log stash right

452
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,279
some some way to look at it

453
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,440
kabana and some way to manipulate it

454
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,800
elasticsearch

455
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,920
um i could this is elk is a

456
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,639
talk in and of itself a hundred talks in

457
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,240
and of itself but i can give you one

458
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,199
piece of advice

459
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,000
here's somewhere to start right be on

460
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,759
your own network

461
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,120
um start uh start uh actually i'm

462
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,480
getting ahead of myself

463
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,600
first let me get to one of the very

464
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,519
specific versions of elk

465
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,240
which is hulk if you uh as much as i

466
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,399
told you to follow david bianco

467
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,759
follow cyber war dog this dude is

468
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,720
insanely smart

469
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,199
uh he created hulk and not a lot of

470
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,000
people know about it

471
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,519
uh you know if you're in the industry

472
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,720
like you've known about this for a while

473
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,199
but

474
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,120
if you haven't played with it go do it

475
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,800
it has everything

476
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,279
um where you can put everything into

477
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,000
logstash

478
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,120
search it in kibana uh uh get stuff

479
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,320
uh out of like a hadoop cluster and it

480
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,000
has access to jupiter notebook

481
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,519
like that's awesome jupyter notebook for

482
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,199
anybody who codes knows what that is

483
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,360
um it's just somewhere to put notes and

484
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,959
it's it's great for coding in python and

485
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,320
things like that so

486
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,360
uh that is uh elk

487
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,880
and help are um are are awesome ways

488
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,000
to get started with this um i'm gonna

489
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,839
have to skip this demo even though i

490
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:30,240
really

491
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,519
really loved that uh i love that

492
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,519
graphic um but if anybody actually wants

493
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,920
a demo uh some other time just hit me up

494
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,360
i was gonna show a little bit of what we

495
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,959
do at work but suffice it to say

496
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,839
ending this first 15-20 minutes of this

497
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,399
cool

498
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,399
you you i threw a bunch at you just now

499
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,639
mostly about how to think about getting

500
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,240
this started

501
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,440
but now you need your own little

502
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,120
infrastructure to do this right like if

503
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,399
you're at home and you're just getting

504
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,399
started so what do you do now

505
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,399
one of my very dearest friends tony

506
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,359
robinson uh he's at da667

507
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,280
on twitter wrote this

508
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,240
nominal book is also phenomenally huge

509
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,559
so

510
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,640
um if you need to like even out the

511
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,559
corner of your house cause it's tilting

512
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,480
this book will do it but get two of them

513
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,919
uh he built a

514
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,640
he wrote a very very good book called

515
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,880
building virtual machine labs

516
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,240
this literally gives you every single

517
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,440
thing you need

518
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,160
to create a virtual lab environment

519
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,919
because it's super easy now when you

520
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,880
have things like

521
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,799
vmware um and uh being able to and then

522
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,000
you create an aws

523
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,840
for all i care wherever you can create

524
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,400
it this is really gonna help you do that

525
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,679
so

526
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,120
to to wrap up that part of this talk

527
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,400
man i can't believe how quickly 20

528
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,559
minutes went um

529
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,080
if blue teaming tactics

530
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,480
threat hunting tactics all start with

531
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,679
asking questions

532
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,000
of your data and the better that you

533
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,039
know that data

534
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
the more higher fidelity questions you

535
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,960
will ask and then you're going to be

536
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,360
like

537
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,000
wall i can't see this thing how do how

538
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,960
do i see this

539
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
that is a genius question that

540
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,000
enterprises still

541
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,240
ask themselves when they start doing

542
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,440
these kinds of

543
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,799
low-level basic techniques of well

544
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,280
i can't see that how do i see that all

545
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,919
right

546
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,200
now i know this person owns that data

547
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,720
and now you go into the super weeds of

548
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
now i need buy-in from who owns that

549
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,640
data and now we need some infrastructure

550
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,160
to get that data into a

551
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,640
centralized see i asked one question and

552
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,840
i'm already like seven layers deep

553
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,679
so uh tldr is

554
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,720
get a book like tony's um look at the

555
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,400
labs and i swear i didn't write it up

556
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,880
yet

557
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,640
but anybody who has questions about how

558
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080
to do this i can

559
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,600
rattle off a hundred different resources

560
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,320
for you

561
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,120
so i just want you to get get get the

562
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,960
concept in your heads of

563
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,840
blue teaming and and hunting and being

564
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,039
on defenses

565
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,960
it's all about asking questions we can

566
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,640
all ask questions don't worry about

567
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,200
knowing everything

568
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,400
all right so now you can hunt you're all

569
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,559
experts right so now

570
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,559
what do you do with that information

571
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,480
just like in that hunting loop

572
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,679
um you have to it's is an

573
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,600
iterative process you ask those

574
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,360
questions you find those things out

575
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,440
well now what do you do you teach it to

576
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,720
somebody else

577
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,640
and you don't even have to be an expert

578
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,919
on it to know it

579
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,679
um we all we love to see success stories

580
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:36,480
right we all

581
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,480
love to see uh uh people

582
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,960
getting it done and at high levels what

583
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,160
i like the most

584
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,360
is fail stories i love

585
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,760
when people come out and say here is how

586
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,320
i royally screwed this up right or here

587
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,120
is how i am

588
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,240
struggling the the easiest and yet the

589
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,400
hardest thing for us to say

590
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,360
is i don't know right especially because

591
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,840
we are

592
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,600
all of um we are all

593
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,360
surrounded by seriously smart people

594
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,280
right and a lot of times

595
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,799
one of my one of the things i love

596
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,480
saying the most is of

597
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
um uh we only see other people's

598
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,080
highlights

599
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,440
right we see people's highlight reels we

600
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
don't see the messy ways that we got

601
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,159
there

602
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,840
so how do we do that we communicate it

603
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,919
and we intro uh this is so this will be

604
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,480
an intro to streaming on twitch

605
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,200
right to communicate now more important

606
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,080
than ever

607
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,559
um so actually before i do this

608
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,360
i'm just going to load up my obs and i'm

609
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,159
going to show you

610
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,400
exactly what i am talking about

611
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,919
john jake how are we doing man i'm good

612
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,440
yeah i can see you

613
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,200
all right cool hey just uh time check

614
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,679
wise uh looks like you've got about

615
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,320
15 a little under 15 minutes left all

616
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,440
right it's kind of

617
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,880
what i was thinking about all right

618
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,600
so live streaming on twitch let me

619
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,880
actually i'm going to do this side by

620
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,200
side

621
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,120
[Music]

622
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,640
get rid of this

623
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,760
and all right

624
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,679
so to there are a lot of ways to live

625
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,559
stream out there

626
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,200
right uh and actually i will put a link

627
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,039
somewhere i gotta find it really quick

628
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,320
uh there is an incredible uh series on

629
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,200
obs

630
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,760
a video series um and i'll shoot the

631
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,960
link after this i don't want to waste

632
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,840
time finding it

633
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,720
but it's a video series on obs and it

634
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,000
gets you started

635
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,919
from the very beginning to the very

636
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,440
advanced stages it's like

637
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,640
at least 30 videos i think um

638
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,880
so you need software and you need

639
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,080
hardware right

640
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,880
uh the software i highly recommend if

641
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,720
you have a windows machine

642
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,000
to get streamlabs obs uh obs

643
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,640
is a i guess in theory a little bit like

644
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,440
linux there's some

645
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,200
there's a couple different flavors uh

646
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,559
obs has their

647
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,600
their uh version which runs on mac um

648
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,080
and it's good it works i ran obs on mac

649
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,360
for a very long time

650
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,760
um obs stands for open broadcasting

651
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,559
system

652
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,640
um but it's kind of buggy it sounds

653
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,400
sometimes it crashes and sucks a little

654
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,520
bit

655
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,480
so if you can get windows i highly

656
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,080
recommend streamlabs obs because it

657
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,679
integrates directly with

658
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,200
streamlabs which is where you get

659
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,640
widgets and stuff and that's a more

660
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,760
detailed talk

661
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,799
um a twitch account so go to twitch.tv

662
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,200
while it's mainly created for gamers and

663
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,080
things like that

664
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,159
i have found it incredibly fun

665
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,520
incredibly useful

666
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,080
uh because of its chat function mostly

667
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,640
and

668
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,200
to just go live and all you need to do

669
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,880
in streamlabs obs is you have a

670
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,080
streaming key

671
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,400
that you get from your twitch account

672
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,200
you put the key

673
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,400
in obs and i literally just hit go live

674
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,280
and this will and this will come up i'll

675
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,039
actually put my main screen on

676
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,559
um and if you're gonna have a panel like

677
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,080
john and jake know i like to

678
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,720
do a lot of panel things um i use zoom

679
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,240
and it's never failed me yet i actually

680
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,880
have the pro

681
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,039
zoom account that lets you have like up

682
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,039
to 150 people

683
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,000
and stream unlimited uh for on unlimited

684
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,600
time or have a meeting for a limited

685
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,159
time

686
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,720
uh if you have the basic uh free tier

687
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,679
you can do

688
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,360
i think up to simultaneously three

689
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,520
people for 40 minutes at a time

690
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,600
but even the pro zoom account it's like

691
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,120
10 bucks a month right it's really not

692
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,000
that bad

693
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,760
um so i'll take you a little bit through

694
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,400
of

695
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,360
uh obs really quick um obs is great you

696
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,000
can zoom in like with the magnifier tool

697
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,559
uh i don't know where's the magnifier

698
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,120
tool okay well never mind uh i'll just

699
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,400
rock on we can zoom in in the video

700
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,919
thanks for for for the text or for uh

701
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,400
the obs uh just just in general it's a

702
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,080
little bit you've got a super like wide

703
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,799
screen there so

704
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,880
it's kind of small oh yeah people asking

705
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,400
about it that's all

706
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,520
good no don't worry um so obs i'll just

707
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,360
expand this for a minute

708
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,400
uh obs is it works on sources right

709
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,120
um so you have i have a main scene this

710
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,960
is like a really basic one that i have

711
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,559
uh my webcam is supposed to be in here

712
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,880
but it's being used right now um

713
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,039
this all seems very like oh my god

714
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,559
there's so much crap here it's really

715
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,440
not that bad

716
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,279
you function on different scenes like i

717
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,279
have a loading scene i have a closing

718
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,000
scene

719
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,760
um and you can make all these different

720
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,200
scenes

721
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,520
and then they are comprised of sources

722
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,840
so i have a border source which gets

723
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,039
highlighted right here

724
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,799
i have a camera source which would be

725
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,559
somewhere in here somewhere

726
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,799
um and then you can have different text

727
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,840
sources

728
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,640
so these function on uh these graphics

729
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:46,960
are

730
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,600
what's called uh twitch twitch overlays

731
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,559
and you can

732
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,960
if you subscribe to stream labs which is

733
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,760
like 10 bucks

734
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,360
i don't get money from them so it's just

735
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,880
i'm just telling you information

736
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,760
um you they give you like free overlays

737
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,200
that you can hit that you can import

738
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,320
into obs

739
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,960
and it you can have a really good

740
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,000
looking thing

741
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,919
really quickly um just by getting some

742
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,240
overlays and then over here you have

743
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,000
like your mic levels and your desktop

744
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
audio so this is what it looks like on

745
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,600
the back end right when you see me

746
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,720
stream on twitch

747
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,640
i'm messing with all of this stuff right

748
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,080
here so

749
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,600
i don't want to get too far in so that's

750
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,200
that's what obs looks like it looks a

751
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,640
little daunting at first but

752
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,320
i will absolutely share that uh link

753
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,679
for uh those instructional videos

754
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,960
now let's get to hardware right this

755
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,159
this is i put this loadout together for

756
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:38,799
what i

757
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,799
have right for what you see like i you

758
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,080
can see i have a green screen behind

759
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,360
me um let me turn my camera like

760
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,520
you might be blinded but here are i have

761
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,879
a three-point lighting system

762
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,240
right over here my monitoring laptop is

763
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,480
over there i have my mixer over here

764
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,000
um and my mic over here

765
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,760
so so that just looks like uh

766
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
so that's um that's what it looks like

767
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,120
in the background right that's all the

768
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
stuff that i have

769
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,640
uh somebody chatting right now um

770
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,679
so uh as far as hardware goes this is

771
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,039
what i have

772
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,000
but bare bare minimum you need a

773
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,039
headphone

774
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,360
and a mic and a camera right that's

775
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,440
really all you need to do this

776
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,559
and all of those sources go into obs

777
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,480
uh but if you're curious about what i'm

778
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
using currently

779
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,840
you could take a picture of this take a

780
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,000
screenshot whatever so i have a nice

781
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,279
road mic uh very fancy

782
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,279
like 200 bucks or something like that uh

783
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,400
i have a

784
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,760
logitech c99rc c922 webcam

785
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,080
it's important when you get a webcam um

786
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,159
that you make sure it has the mounting

787
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:52,799
bracket

788
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,679
uh underneath because you can get i have

789
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,559
somewhere over here

790
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,480
uh mine's currently sitting on like a

791
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,360
tripod a little portable tripod which is

792
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,559
awesome you could take it anywhere you

793
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,480
want you take a camera anywhere you want

794
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,360
um i have a main mixer because i do some

795
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
other djing and things like that

796
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,000
um but if you got something like you can

797
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,720
get uh

798
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,919
a blue yeti microphone right for like

799
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:16,799
120 bucks like there's

800
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,799
i think they're still super affordable

801
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,399
as long as there wasn't like a run on

802
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,360
them or something

803
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,799
um and that's the usb

804
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,559
and the usb goes directly into your

805
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,640
computer and it registers an obs and

806
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,679
that's all you need

807
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,960
that's all you need to get up and

808
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,919
running um and by the way obs is free

809
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,080
you don't have to pay a dime for it uh

810
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,840
both the mac and the windows versions

811
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,720
are free

812
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,960
you can subscribe to stream labs to get

813
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,200
things like widgets and overlays and

814
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,080
make everything look all pretty but at

815
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,480
your

816
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,279
basic thing you need obs um there are

817
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,960
other ones out there but this is pretty

818
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,080
much the standard

819
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,760
and a headphones uh a camera and a mic

820
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,039
um the thing about twitch is that

821
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,799
twitch was always meant to be like a

822
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,360
very uh quick bang solution right it's

823
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,559
instant it goes up

824
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,080
and then those videos come down after a

825
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,440
while because it makes room for other

826
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,799
things if you make highlights of your

827
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,600
videos

828
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,000
uh they stay up so i have long term

829
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,640
storage

830
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,200
uh every video i have i i record you can

831
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,799
record locally in obs

832
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,320
if if you just want to make

833
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,799
instructional videos obs is amazing

834
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,200
because you can just uh record it

835
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,919
locally

836
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,440
and then cut it up in something like

837
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,760
some people use a adobe studio

838
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,320
um i use something called camtasia which

839
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,480
is like a hundred bucks for a license

840
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
um but you can also get like adobe

841
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
studio for a subscription

842
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,399
of 20 bucks a month or something like

843
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,159
that so um

844
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,799
i put all my long-term ones up on vimeo

845
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,799
uh i'm kind of pissy with youtube right

846
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,559
now because they've been taking down

847
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,880
hacking themed videos even instructional

848
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,600
things

849
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,640
i don't know if they're still being

850
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,880
dicks about that but uh

851
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,279
so mine's more of like in my own little

852
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,799
ethical conundrum of where to put it so

853
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:57,919
i put up on video

854
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,600
vimeo because they've never been accused

855
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,120
of that um

856
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,559
youtube straight up does it so just

857
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,240
something to be aware of

858
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,279
a green screen not required but man

859
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,840
