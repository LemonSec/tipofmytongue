1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,310
so the last talk in this session is a

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,309
general proof framework for recent AES

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,840
distinguishers and as already said it's

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,209
basically a follow-up to a previous talk

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,370
the paper is by Cristiano Booga and

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,010
contour on Daniel Katya and Daniel will

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,020
give a talk

8
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:23,789
thank you get on Thank You Enzo for your

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:27,619
your talk this work with an contour

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:30,449
nebula is a subsequent to the work of

11
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:34,559
Lorenzo Grassi Christian hershberger and

12
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,719
Sandra Hanuman is distinguishes indeed

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,629
we have studied the recent ideas

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,320
distinguishes and we have managed to

15
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:45,180
give a proof for them that allowed us to

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,930
generalize that them for other

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,269
Espeon ciphers so I'll begin with the

18
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:56,750
necessary preliminaries even though if

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:59,910
Lorenzo did it so we work with the 4x4

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,879
matrices with scholars in F 2 to the 8th

21
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:06,210
and I'm going to define some subspaces

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,610
of this this vector space so first we

23
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:14,309
have the columns which are defined by

24
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:16,110
which all sets well whose non zero whose

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,210
elements have nonzero elements on the

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,539
first column for example for cannon zero

27
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,610
if we can see get the several indices we

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,250
it's just the direction of current

29
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,640
spaces so directions of current spaces

30
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,860
give column spaces and there are other

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,729
interesting subspaces there are the Yaga

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,950
knows which define such that the image

33
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,740
through shift rows gives color give

34
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,470
column spaces there are anti diagonals

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,600
who are images through shift rows of the

36
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,970
current spaces and finally mixed spaces

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,899
which are the images by the mixed

38
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,789
currents of the inter diagonal spaces

39
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:57,090
what's interesting about those subspaces

40
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,159
is that diagonals are mapped to currents

41
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,890
after the run function of the AES and

42
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,700
currents are not into the mixed base

43
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:09,660
after one one function of the AES

44
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:12,330
but the AES is a alternating cipher so

45
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,970
we want from those spaces is to to

46
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:18,420
verify a much stronger property and this

47
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:21,180
is the property of sadness trades so if

48
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,910
I consider the function f subspace is U

49
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,670
and V I'll say that U and V define such

50
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:31,560
a straight through F if every closet of

51
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:34,079
U is mapped into a cassette of V and the

52
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,020
good news is that diagonals and canons

53
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,640
define subspaces success trail for the

54
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,200
run function of the AES as well as

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,700
current and mixed basis basis this is

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,829
enough to understand what the x

57
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,920
distinguisher is about so take an

58
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:53,010
element a you take a diagonal space and

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,109
a mixed space and if you come the number

60
00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:00,870
of pairs of elements who belong to

61
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,820
elements from this cassette of diagonal

62
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,490
whose difference after five rounds

63
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,650
belong to the same to the chosen mix

64
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,800
space well this number will always be a

65
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,770
multiple of eight so what have we done

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,690
with that in the original paper so I

67
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:22,080
cure crypt 2017 it was said in the in

68
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,810
the proof that the this multiple weight

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,209
property would not depend of the details

70
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,130
of the icebox but that the linear layer

71
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,310
would need the maximal branch number

72
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,590
what we weren't really convinced with

73
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,020
that and we had to rewrite a new proof

74
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,420
to be convinced that maximal branch

75
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,180
number is not necessary and the fact

76
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,359
that we didn't need this maximal branch

77
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,400
number made us ask if it was possible to

78
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,680
adapt this distinguishes two other spin

79
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:56,670
ciphers so we have we will have to look

80
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,040
into the details of the proof what's

81
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,738
interesting is that we have those two

82
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,380
rounds of space chairs the key thing is

83
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,780
that those suspect rails are linked by a

84
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,799
1-run property between mix spaces and

85
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,830
diagonals

86
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,480
this property should look familiar if

87
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,660
you look at the number of pairs of

88
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,488
elements from this cassette of a mixed

89
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,620
base that whose difference after four

90
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:21,269
after one round belongs to the same

91
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,139
diagonal this number is a multiple of

92
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,710
eight

93
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:28,330
to prove this we begin with the

94
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,969
definition of an equivalence relation

95
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:34,780
between pairs of states so here I have

96
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:37,659
the example of a pair of states in the

97
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,179
mix page 0 so this is a dimension for

98
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:42,729
subspace and if we look carefully at

99
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,919
this the elements of this pair we see

100
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:49,780
that their share coordinates on basis

101
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:52,090
vectors 2 & 3 but they have different

102
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,559
coordinates and currents on basis

103
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,219
vectors 0 & 1

104
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,810
and then we define the information set K

105
00:04:57,219 --> 00:05:03,400
of such a pair as the indices of the

106
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,819
basis vectors where the coordinates

107
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:10,210
differ so in my example the the

108
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:15,250
information set would be 0 1 if I take

109
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:17,529
this other pair I see that it also has

110
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,870
different same same coordinates and

111
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:24,389
basis vectors 2 & 3 but different

112
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:27,599
coordinates on basis vectors 0 & 1

113
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:31,060
moreover if I look carefully at

114
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:33,219
coordinates on basis vectors 0 & 1 they

115
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,520
are the same as the first pair but they

116
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:39,099
have been swapped so that's how I define

117
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,020
an equivalence relation if I take two

118
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:43,690
paths P&Q if they share the same

119
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,190
information set and if inside the

120
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,520
information set the coordinates are the

121
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,960
same but have been at most swapped well

122
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,508
I will say that those pairs are

123
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,448
equivalent what's really nice with this

124
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:58,539
equivalence relation is that this

125
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:02,139
function Delta which which takes as

126
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:04,599
input an ordered pair and computes the

127
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:05,889
difference after five round while this

128
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:09,669
function Delta is constant and

129
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:11,589
equivalence classes another nice

130
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,909
property is that the coordinates of

131
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:16,419
equivalence classes can be easily

132
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:18,909
computed in function of the size of the

133
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:24,039
information set so I have this power of

134
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:28,900
2 and the exponent is always bigger than

135
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:32,469
3 which means that this cart analogy

136
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:35,469
will always be a multiple of 8 so if I

137
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:37,810
take back the Nama if I write the number

138
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:39,759
n as the number of pairs whose

139
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:44,110
difference after one round belong to the

140
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:47,099
same diagonal I can express it the

141
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:50,620
continuity I mean as the number of pairs

142
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:51,069
whose image through Delta belongs to the

143
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,919
diagonal

144
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:57,069
since equivalence classes form a

145
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,990
partition I can write n as the

146
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:02,289
sum over the equivalence classes and if

147
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,909
you look at those intersections the fact

148
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:07,449
that Delta is constant and equivalence

149
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:09,819
classes means implies that this

150
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:12,669
intersection is either the empty set

151
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:15,069
either the whole class and since all the

152
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:18,128
classes have a cardinality which is a

153
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:22,680
multiple of 8 the number N is a multiple

154
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:24,819
of 8 so what about the branch number

155
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,759
well the influence of the branch number

156
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:31,569
is the following if I take B if I call

157
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:34,539
be the branch number it permits it

158
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:37,300
allows me to refine in the in the

159
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:39,399
expression for which equivalence class I

160
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,399
will have an empty set or possibly a

161
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:47,409
non-empty set but it won't affect the

162
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:51,069
multiple of property so first question

163
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:56,620
is answered and we will see now how we

164
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:59,560
can use this proof to four other s P

165
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:03,099
ends well I have to explain how we

166
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,289
generalize a bit this proof so remember

167
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:07,899
that a few slides earlier we define the

168
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:12,878
mixed places as the image of currents

169
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:14,620
through the linear layer VA s then once

170
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,750
we had the mix places I define an

171
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,449
equivalence relation which was highly

172
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:23,469
dependent on the structure of the mix

173
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:27,699
spaces indeed I needed to express basis

174
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:31,629
vectors coordinates and this equivalence

175
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:35,909
relation allowed me to state this very

176
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:39,039
important theorem for me and which

177
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,280
relies which depends on the the wrong

178
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,549
function of the AES

179
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:46,130
there has to be some magic between the

180
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:48,290
structure of the mix pace and the run

181
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:52,580
function of a yes to have the theorem to

182
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:55,880
hold what is it then I'll give you a

183
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:59,270
hint this is the basis of the mixed base

184
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,490
zero two in the canonical basis the

185
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,350
canonical basis is basically the basis

186
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,710
on which the sub base operation is

187
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:09,140
defined and what should be obvious is

188
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:12,830
that this basis forms a block diagonal

189
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:15,410
matrix that's we that will be the the

190
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,780
main characterization of subspaces that

191
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:21,319
could replace mixed bases in what we

192
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:24,550
want to do we call them compatible with

193
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,350
sub bytes subspaces so what

194
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:32,959
characterizes is such a subspace V is

195
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:35,200
that it got its got basis G which can be

196
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:39,920
expressed at the block diagonal matrix

197
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:43,340
in the canonical basis the box can have

198
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,370
any size what matters is the number of

199
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:50,089
blocks indeed the number of blocks H

200
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:54,770
will give me the modulus of the the

201
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:58,520
cardinality of equivalence classes well

202
00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:00,800
this is a more trivial example than the

203
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,480
previous one but this is the the the

204
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,260
mixed base which is used in the York

205
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,020
read paper and in the mixture

206
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:12,200
differential we just saw so you see the

207
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,000
block diagonal basis of m0 so it's

208
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:19,820
compatible with subbytes and the theorem

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,710
holds and everything well I get back to

210
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,680
the first mixture through the mixture

211
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:27,050
differential of Lorenzo because this

212
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:31,300
this is a way of things seeing things

213
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:34,459
permits to prove it in another way so

214
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,620
I'll state it with my own notations

215
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:40,130
which are very inspired of Lorenzo's

216
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:44,960
notations so I take an element a I take

217
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:48,500
this vector subspace you and I take him

218
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:53,280
expects it was a mixed place I take

219
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:56,970
elements of this form p p0 p1 0 p1

220
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,980
and the result is that the difference

221
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,980
after four rounds of the pair P belongs

222
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,810
to the mix pace have chosen if and only

223
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,400
if the difference after four rounds with

224
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,400
the pair Q belongs to the mix pace

225
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:13,020
well let's prove it away so this

226
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,930
subspace you can be expressed that

227
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:19,980
decent section I defined this subspace V

228
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:21,870
and what we already know is that U and V

229
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:26,010
form a subspace trail for the round

230
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:30,630
function which means that the images of

231
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:34,350
PE 0 P 1 Q 0 Q 1 all after one round all

232
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:37,590
belong to the same set of V what's

233
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,510
interesting with thee is that it's

234
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:45,060
compatible with subbytes because of the

235
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:48,210
block diagonal basis now if you we just

236
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:52,589
compute what p 0 P 1 Q 0 Q 1 give after

237
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:56,910
one round and what we got is that the

238
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:59,730
way we've chosen p0 p1 g0 Q 1 the images

239
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:10,130
form equivalent pairs in the compatible

240
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:13,110
Co set V + B then the theorem holds and

241
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:15,120
this permits to have this equality so

242
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:19,290
this should remind you of what nor ENSO

243
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,910
just showed us and this equality thanks

244
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:24,150
to the subspace trails from dry

245
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:27,750
diagonals to make spaces gives the final

246
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:30,240
result so this is not game-changing

247
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,470
cryptanalytic results to have this is a

248
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,950
different proof but what's interesting

249
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:37,710
is that we had the unifier we have a

250
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:40,230
unified framework for both multiple of

251
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:42,270
properties and different mixture

252
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:46,620
different roles and we can prove them

253
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:50,160
the same way well this allows us to have

254
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,410
this generalization allows us also to

255
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,620
adapt it to other SPN cipher so I'll

256
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:57,839
give you two examples first one is

257
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,880
mirroring so mirror is very similar in

258
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,700
structure to the a yes the interesting

259
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,280
thing for me is that the mix currents

260
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,050
which is defined by this matrix has

261
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,819
bunch number 4

262
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:13,979
so it's not Maximo because Maximo branch

263
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:16,890
number would be five thanks to the work

264
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,870
of lender to scan and Vemma we had

265
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,209
algorithms that can prove that the

266
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,910
longest of pastries we can get for

267
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:25,829
misery or of the same form as for the

268
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,719
AES so we take columns and we can define

269
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:30,479
diagonals and make spaces in the same

270
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:37,529
fashion and we have to run subspace

271
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:39,360
rails the mix spaces for misery so for

272
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:43,700
example here you have the meter image

273
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:46,519
space zero also block diagonal basis

274
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,230
with four blocks so we also have

275
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:52,230
equivalence classes with cardinality

276
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:56,339
multiple of eight because there are four

277
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:58,110
blocks and hence we have the multiple of

278
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,269
eight distinguish on five rounds for

279
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:04,550
Midori even if the branch number is is

280
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:06,779
four so this we do not claim any

281
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,969
important cryptanalytic result again

282
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:11,520
because meter is got sixteen or five

283
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:14,430
rounds or twenty rounds so five runs is

284
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,040
not a lot compared to the total number

285
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,739
of rounds but the students interesting

286
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,360
to illustrate that the branch number

287
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:26,010
doesn't need to be maximal to have this

288
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:29,490
kind of distinguishes the other example

289
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:34,740
is Cline it's got a slightly different

290
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:37,890
states but the components are nearly the

291
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:43,500
same substitution layer permutation and

292
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:47,760
a mixed current then just so again the

293
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:50,370
algorithms from the from Landis Canon

294
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,890
female allowed to find the longest

295
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:55,850
subspace trails so it's very similar to

296
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:59,100
what we had with the AES and mirroring

297
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:02,399
and if you look at the client mix space

298
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,430
for example the client mix by zero here

299
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,470
it's got the block diagonal matrix with

300
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,579
two blocks

301
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,029
what's interesting for me here is that

302
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:13,709
that changes the modulus of the

303
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:18,120
continuity of the equivalence classes it

304
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:20,880
will only be two here so we have a

305
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:25,170
multiple of two distinguisher four five

306
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,970
grounds of traffic lining so again when

307
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,760
compared to the total number of rounds

308
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:32,250
offline what the interest is not purely

309
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,050
cryptanalytic but it's still interesting

310
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,720
to see that we can have other than

311
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,729
multiple of eight properties but we have

312
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,960
can also have multiple of to multiple of

313
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:45,710
four and so on and all this thanks to

314
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:50,250
this adapted lemma we managed to get

315
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:53,130
with block diagonal basis so as a

316
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:57,270
conclusion generalized proof framework

317
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:58,980
with the algorithms of land test can and

318
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,439
var can find mixture different Shore

319
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:04,230
properties distinguishes and multiple of

320
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,410
properties in kind of a systematic way

321
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:09,570
for any SPN I'm not saying that this

322
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:14,130
will cover a large number of rounds but

323
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:17,820
it can be done in a systematic way as

324
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:21,110
for the improvements of these techniques

325
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:25,160
I think they are highly limited by the

326
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:27,810
length of the space trailers we can get

327
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:31,199
but basically the longest of space where

328
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,839
we can have if the final space of the

329
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,420
subspace trails can have a block

330
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,490
diagonal basis we can build such a

331
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,219
distinguished but again the length of

332
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:45,240
source of such subspace trails is too

333
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:48,330
limited to give big improvements of

334
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,840
these techniques well thanks for

335
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:54,860
listening and if you have any questions

336
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,860
I'd be happy to answer them

337
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:07,589
do we have questions thank you I think

338
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,439
you basically answered my question with

339
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:12,899
your last pun but just to be sure so but

340
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,880
now that you have tested this kind of

341
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,589
distinguish or in a few different kind

342
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,860
of structure if you want to stick to an

343
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:23,399
aligned design strategy where you have

344
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:25,290
both some bytes and shift etc what's the

345
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,689
best and the worst you could do to

346
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,970
resist those distinguishers so for

347
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:33,600
instance is it too if you have a full

348
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,680
state matrix multiplication does it

349
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,770
really destroy every

350
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,870
very quickly or can you still when you

351
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,379
say full state I understand over f2 a

352
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,739
dance

353
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:46,440
no still on the the size of the other

354
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:54,390
knee bolts of the cells yes but but a

355
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:57,780
dense matrix for instance well III don't

356
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,850
think that's gonna change if I

357
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:05,399
understood correctly what you see for

358
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:08,100
example that for the yeah for the a s we

359
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:12,390
have this we're having a dense matrix we

360
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:15,300
maybe change the the we would have to

361
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,070
maybe different values for M 0 then for

362
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,500
M 1 on others

363
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,860
well it won't change maybe not don't

364
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,360
change the the the block diagonal basis

365
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,889
fact I am Not sure I understood

366
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,590
correctly your question

367
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,350
if I wanted to - - I mean to break this

368
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:34,409
kind of thing for example for Krypton

369
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:38,250
which has a linear layer which is only

370
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:40,920
after linear this wouldn't work because

371
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:43,890
the the fact that the this is after to

372
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,870
the 8 linear allows you to have more or

373
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,180
more runs in the subspace trade zone and

374
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:59,090
to have these those block diagonals and

375
00:18:48,180 --> 00:19:01,530
matrix okay thanks for questions

376
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,419
so you know lets thankful speaker again

377
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:10,199
on all who speakers of a session

378
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:10,199
