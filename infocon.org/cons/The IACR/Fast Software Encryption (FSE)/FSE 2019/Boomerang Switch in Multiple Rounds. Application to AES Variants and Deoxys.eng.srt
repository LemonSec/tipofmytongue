1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,620
it's on boomerang switch in multiple

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,290
rounds application to AES variance and

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,950
the Oxus and the talk is given by how

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,950
jung-hwan

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,609
thank you for introduction hello

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,220
everyone oh yeah the title of this talk

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,769
is boom one switch in multiple rounds

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,019
application to EES variance and the

9
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:30,150
exists this is John work with storm

10
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:32,790
appearing its lucky to be the last one I

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,570
can escape this background very quickly

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:39,719
ok I use the same notation as a lustre

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,170
talk so here's a boom wrong are far Beta

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,480
Gamma Delta so boom ROI is divided I

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,000
divide the cipher into two sub cipher

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,029
and there one trial for easy row and

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,219
another 141 and the probability can be

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:01:01,140
computed can be computed by this then

19
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:03,840
when the boom run tag was first proposed

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:09,780
the two trials assumed to be independent

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,970
but however after some falling work and

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,369
experiments shows that at the boundary

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,240
of the two trials there may be some

24
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:21,299
differences and so some we have some

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,810
positive effect or negative effect for

26
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,540
the positive effects made some results

27
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,820
show that some active Xboxes as a

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,329
boundary can be saved so that we can

29
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,360
improve the boom wrong distinguisher so

30
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:39,570
in order to capture this dependency in

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,960
the boom run tag some detect is was a

32
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:46,139
proposed an e/m is the part two contains

33
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:51,960
the dependent part of the sum of the two

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:56,040
trials here I will just show the letter

35
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,380
switch and s box which under the summit

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,530
attack so the left is a some letter

37
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,949
switch letter switch happens when there

38
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:09,780
tout zero net plus 0 equal to 0 which

39
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:13,230
means that here's a y 3 y 3 will equal

40
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,620
to y 1 because we XOR 0 difference to

41
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,200
eval

42
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,900
it doesn't change anything so on the

43
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,420
other side of this boom wrong on this

44
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,150
sbox level it will return with

45
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:28,049
probability 1 so for the latter switch

46
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:32,730
the probability or is 1 and then for the

47
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:35,730
right part is s box which the S box

48
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:40,109
which happens when a + 0 equal to Delta

49
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:44,609
1 this is because the difference between

50
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:48,810
y 1 and y 2 is equal to Delta 1 so if we

51
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:52,319
XOR order to 1 to Y 1 this means that

52
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:56,790
the Y's for what you get 2y 1 and then Y

53
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,440
3 equal to Y 2 this just on day so the

54
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,420
pair of values on the other side the

55
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,560
boomer on just exchange the position

56
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,899
from the depth from the previous site so

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,260
on the other side the boom run can

58
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,200
return with probability 1 so the final

59
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:19,290
probability will only count it for one

60
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:22,319
side of this boom wrong here the in

61
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,170
order but in order to cut in order to

62
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,768
provide a systematic evaluation of the

63
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:34,138
e/m inside the savage attack PCT is a

64
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:36,930
proposal so it folks on the e/m when

65
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:48,450
when it is and consists of a single s

66
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:51,780
box layer so it takes two can test two

67
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:54,328
parameters here and here and the

68
00:03:51,780 --> 00:04:00,139
entrance for the t ball can be computed

69
00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:03,630
by this formula i will not explain and

70
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:06,269
the advantage of the PCT is that it can

71
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,780
it can covers the stretching effect of

72
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,049
ladder switch as box which and

73
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,359
incompatibility

74
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:15,329
for example the incompatibility

75
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:19,889
corresponds to the zero entry of the

76
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:23,190
visa t so besides the BCG offers a sweet

77
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:26,130
news which in fact like compared to s

78
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,940
boxes this box which we are nebula 0

79
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,020
equal to the

80
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:33,510
1 PCT doesn't that PCT does not require

81
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,930
the value of a delta 1 which means that

82
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:39,750
during the boom once which there might

83
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,870
be some other values of delta 1 so that

84
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:47,000
which could so that could lead to a

85
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:50,160
higher switching probability now

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,740
motivation is like similar to the last

87
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,860
talk is can we extend eeehm to multiple

88
00:04:52,740 --> 00:05:00,170
rounds if yes can we apply the current

89
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,170
switching technique to have a values are

90
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:08,310
first let's determine the our number

91
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:10,950
rounds and yeah so start with idea of

92
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:14,310
letters which the idea of lattice which

93
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,990
is the wrong function of a cipher can be

94
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,840
divided into two interior member

95
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:22,410
independent parts which can operate in

96
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:25,320
parallel this figure is an example of a

97
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,780
yes as we know a the state internal

98
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,169
state of a es can be reported into two

99
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:33,479
parts up to two round here we emits here

100
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:36,419
we all miss the last the remaining

101
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,790
linear layers address over the second

102
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,950
round because a linear layer has no

103
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:44,130
impact on the sweet on the boom or

104
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:46,560
switch so here we can just say that we

105
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,360
can divide the internal state into the

106
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,030
right part and the blue part and that

107
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,700
each transformation can operate these

108
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:59,099
two parts separately and they have no

109
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:02,340
interaction so so so if the right part

110
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,650
is only active in the lower track and

111
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,799
the blue part is only active in the

112
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:11,010
upper 12 so we can just assign the right

113
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:15,090
part to be the a part of our upper trial

114
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:17,789
assign the blue part to be the part of a

115
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,539
large file so in this way all activist

116
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:26,810
bosses can be passed with probability 1

117
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:29,820
then let's extend this idea let's in

118
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:33,270
record that the procedure of the boom

119
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:36,750
run so for the upper trial is words

120
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:39,000
first it was used in the encryption for

121
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,220
encryption direction which is a forward

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,890
direction

123
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,080
and when we encrypt and the Lord trial

124
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:48,950
is used in the backward direction which

125
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,349
is the decryption question so um if the

126
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:54,320
forward diffusion of the active cells is

127
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,900
a betrayal has no interaction with a

128
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,540
backward diffusion with active South in

129
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,870
the Lord's house or right quartet the VM

130
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:07,220
can be generated with probability 1 so

131
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:10,010
here is a 4-run IM mizuki skini it's

132
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,920
probability 1 so here's a upper trial

133
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:16,750
shows that the fridge diffusion pattern

134
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:21,590
in four rounds starting from one single

135
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:24,110
starting from a one single cells and the

136
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,750
Lord trials start is also a four run

137
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,810
diffusion for run backwards diffusion

138
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:34,280
starting from one single active cells so

139
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:37,730
this two trials has no overlapped active

140
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:41,179
cells they have no interactions so with

141
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:44,210
me so this en can write quartet this en

142
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:47,419
can be generated it's probability 1 so

143
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:50,870
the reason that why ye was skinny has

144
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:53,840
more runs in a.m. is that it has a

145
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:58,840
slower diffusion layer the skinny event

146
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:02,000
the IES then we found out

147
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:05,270
incompatibility in multiple rounds like

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,120
say that it is claimed that PCT can

149
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:11,390
detect incompatibility wows entry is

150
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:17,180
zero so here is also example of a two

151
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:20,060
round e/m of AES so this to trial valid

152
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:23,000
with probability to the miners 2 to the

153
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:26,240
power minus 7 and for the first S box

154
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,230
layer frost icebox layer they are only

155
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,799
one overlapped overlapped s boxes and

156
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:37,940
the nth PCT entry for this for this for

157
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:41,120
this S box as 2 is nonzero and for the

158
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:44,900
second s box layer is only also only one

159
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,080
as boxes overlapped and DB city entry is

160
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,930
also 2 non zero so according to the bc t

161
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,170
is this - trial should be comparable in

162
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,599
the boom one switch but

163
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:59,020
however this is not true so we found

164
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:05,170
that for the for the first a spoke layer

165
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:08,620
here the PDP CTD f e9 p f e9 + p DG d FF

166
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:11,349
1 cannot be nonzero simultaneously this

167
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,110
shows that this 3 value has some

168
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,630
correlation within the boom run switch

169
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:20,320
in the boom run tag so here with some

170
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:22,360
was we summarized some of the other

171
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:27,130
vision on the S box in the boom on

172
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:29,980
switch so here we take into the Delta 0

173
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:32,950
Delta 1 and nebula 0 into consideration

174
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:36,580
so when we fixed the value of dirt has

175
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:40,450
zero and Delta 1 the choices on nebula 0

176
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:42,700
the no choices is limited and the

177
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:46,390
maximum number one on travel value of a

178
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:51,190
nebula 0 is equal to 2 times L chose to

179
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:54,069
+1 and then of course given weight fixed

180
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:58,000
Delta 0 and the nebula 0 the choices of

181
00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:01,320
Geritol 1 is still limited so in order

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,680
to capture this observations we propose

183
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,960
boom wrong different stable some PDT in

184
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,719
short this is a very simple and

185
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:14,080
straightforward Tebow is a combination

186
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,930
of a PCT and DDT and takes into Delta 0

187
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:20,770
turtle 1 nebula 0 into consideration

188
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:24,130
although see this formula is long but

189
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:27,310
the former part is a PCT the later part

190
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:30,040
is a DDT that's all an end s box size

191
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:33,609
even though we have the three parameters

192
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:36,569
in the table but these tables you are

193
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:39,370
very manageable like for 8 PS boxes and

194
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:42,700
the time complexity for the construction

195
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:45,910
is Big O and 2 to the power 2 and which

196
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:48,030
is exactly same with the DDT and we all

197
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:54,339
makes a algorithm here please check that

198
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:57,670
paper for detail and some properties

199
00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:03,010
since the combination were P DT and VC T

200
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:06,729
so we can convert PDT to DDT when like

201
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:09,189
nebula 0 equal to 0 or equal to

202
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:14,200
they're the one and also we can convert

203
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:16,450
PDT to BCT so in some evaluations in

204
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,760
some case we can just convert use the

205
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:23,170
DVD and BCT to evaluate the boom on

206
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:26,740
switch for implicitly and also the PDT

207
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:29,319
concurrent can detect compatibility when

208
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,750
the corresponding entry is 0 so for

209
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:37,390
example for the previous example it can

210
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:39,700
easily detect a compatibility here so I

211
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:44,710
will show Tecton turn around

212
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:48,670
oh yes 256 first is the attack model we

213
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:51,310
we look our tag is under the related key

214
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,170
attack which is that address range can

215
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,380
choose our relation between several keys

216
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,599
and get our Krypton decryption Oracle

217
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,630
with this kiss and also there is a

218
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,240
special case like related sub K so

219
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:07,030
instead of choosing your relation

220
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,150
between master key thousand three is

221
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:12,610
allowed to relation between sub case so

222
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:15,699
the advantage is obvious it will be

223
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,890
easier to obtain desire related sub sub

224
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,740
key difference in a nonlinear key

225
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,689
difference in nonlinear case schedule so

226
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,510
that he can they don't have to pay some

227
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:29,050
probability in the key schedule and thus

228
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:32,319
I wanted uses its required complex K

229
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:35,170
access key scheme which means we will be

230
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:40,000
less critical and sometimes even too

231
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:42,160
contrived for academic interest so this

232
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,540
is of attack we stick to relate key

233
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,760
attack since the kiss schedule of AES is

234
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:51,250
nonlinear so we used our latest K

235
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,020
difference parse differential parse in

236
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,730
the upper trial and the single K

237
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,470
different part for the lower trial and

238
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:02,230
the strategies of constructing the upper

239
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:05,410
trial we use the local collision like in

240
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:08,140
this figure so first we introduce the

241
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:11,260
difference in to the internal state then

242
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,240
after one round the next one key

243
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,700
difference will cancel out the internal

244
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,250
difference so we can repeat this

245
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,880
patterns for several times constructing

246
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,339
this

247
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,740
our trial and also when we constructing

248
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:27,019
the boom wall distinguisher we apply the

249
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:30,730
boom run suite in two rounds

250
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:34,550
in mind in order to gain some benefit

251
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:36,589
here is a here is a upper to our left is

252
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,949
the upper trial of our attack and the

253
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:43,519
right is a lower trial the other tack so

254
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:46,339
the upper trial covers rock one to run

255
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,370
nine is nine rounds and the lower trial

256
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:52,940
covers from a two run ten Ronson is used

257
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:57,350
for key recovery and run eight and run

258
00:13:52,940 --> 00:14:00,319
nine is covered by en okay then I will

259
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:04,490
explain how to evaluate the to run a amp

260
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:08,479
by BDT here so the color here the red

261
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:10,190
blue or the - gray a fixed value only

262
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,220
the green values are random we don't

263
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:17,329
care what evaluated so first the beta

264
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:20,269
the beta here beta is a stick difference

265
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:22,550
gamma is a stiff difference they are

266
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:25,639
determined by easier and you won so they

267
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:30,829
are fixed so let's first take a look at

268
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:33,949
the first sbox layer here so first they

269
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:37,040
are only one overlap active s boxes

270
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:40,670
right so with for this S box with fixed

271
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,829
value of Delta one so that after shift

272
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:46,060
through a mix column the difference of a

273
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:49,219
first column can be cancelled out by the

274
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:52,880
wrong key difference so that at the

275
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:57,139
second at the second here s box here

276
00:14:52,880 --> 00:15:00,290
there are no overlap as boxes so after

277
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:03,230
we fixed after we fix turtle one we can

278
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:07,610
look into the BDT to check white which

279
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:11,620
values of nebula zero which satisfies

280
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:15,709
that entry of a BD T is non zero so

281
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:18,079
after and after we found the values of a

282
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:21,920
nebula zero the switching probability is

283
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:25,130
obtained opposite OPA accordingly then

284
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,889
for the further second s box layer even

285
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,630
though there's no overlap S boxes but we

286
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:32,510
still have to pay the switching

287
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,699
probability because the nebula 1 prime

288
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:38,920
is

289
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:40,430
uniquely determined by nabla zero so

290
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:44,870
even us

291
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:48,800
so since nabla zero prime is zero due to

292
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:51,319
the relation between P DT and D DT so

293
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,870
for simplicity we can use the D DT here

294
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:56,120
to evaluate that switching probability

295
00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:00,019
of the second sbox layer like that with

296
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:05,269
entry nabla one zero and a blah-de-blah

297
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:08,660
zero zero Prime so the result of attack

298
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:11,630
is when only need to relate case and

299
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,699
time and data complexity to them to the

300
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:17,079
power seventy-five we can recover the

301
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:20,719
four key so compared to this without

302
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:23,750
existing attacks this even though they

303
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:28,220
claim that the time is 2 to the power 45

304
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:31,100
is lower but the only can recover 35 sub

305
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,019
K bits so actually if they want to

306
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,680
recover the folk case they won't need to

307
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:38,209
hover over the power to 121 and also

308
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,089
there are tech model it's a related

309
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:44,209
subject so compared to them

310
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:50,930
we have posts improvements on the tech

311
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:53,689
model and complexity and also way applic

312
00:16:50,930 --> 00:17:00,819
applied promise with multiple rounds and

313
00:16:53,690 --> 00:17:05,059
BTT in four run a es 192 and the Oxus BC

314
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:07,819
so way we apply to the three current

315
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:10,490
works so the first one is a it's a

316
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:12,889
well-known paper that is proposed first

317
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:16,309
related key boom run tag on for around a

318
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:19,280
es 192 and the second one is of improved

319
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:23,149
based on the pressed on the first paper

320
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:26,959
and as a result remains as a best attack

321
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:31,309
and then we applied to the Dukes SPC a

322
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:34,490
team round so I will only explain the

323
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:39,320
improvement of the best attack on a yes

324
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:42,470
192 the idea of original attack is they

325
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:45,320
use a similar idea of a local low

326
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,400
calculation and also their improvement

327
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,210
based on the

328
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,840
of improvement from the first attack

329
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:56,900
faster talk about yes 192 is that they

330
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,179
mostly mice the boom once which they in

331
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,660
there boom want extinguisher and we have

332
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:06,220
already we have tried our BDT to do a

333
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:11,390
revaluation of the boom Ron we found no

334
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:14,960
no improvement so then we try to extract

335
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:18,340
an upper trial and then we managed to

336
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,860
extend the boom one switch to two round

337
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:24,850
and also that it is a similar to run en

338
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:28,100
above our improve attack like say even

339
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:30,110
here the first a spots layer and the

340
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:33,980
second s box layer we can say there is

341
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:37,340
no overlap active s boxes and so does

342
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:41,450
here but this does not mean this Pumas

343
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:43,699
which is totally free because here the

344
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:46,790
turtle one of this value and turtle

345
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,670
nabla one prime this value is fixed so

346
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:53,840
we still have to use the B DT to

347
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:59,360
evaluate this and this as boxes to get

348
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:02,360
the switching probabilities and the

349
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,790
result that we can for the past attack

350
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,899
we can get an improvement not too high

351
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:11,178
to the power 1 point 3 and we reevaluate

352
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,130
the boom on distinguisher of the first

353
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:15,710
attack and we did not change anything

354
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,720
and we found that the attack should be

355
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:21,710
better like with the factor of 2 to the

356
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:25,240
power 4 point 8 and we also use a BDD

357
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:30,820
you to improve that UPC 256 and

358
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,820
improvement is 2 to the power 1 point 6

359
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:38,840
to conclude so the slower diffusion

360
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:41,780
ciphers more rounds will be impact by

361
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:44,120
the switch in fact now we'll introduce a

362
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,250
PDT to easily evaluate the boom on

363
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,860
switch in multiple rounds and then we

364
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:53,330
propose a attack on turn around

365
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:58,760
AES 256 and the for round a yes 192 and

366
00:19:53,330 --> 00:20:02,949
the oxy PC 256 thank you thank you

367
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:10,280
[Applause]

368
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:11,780
so are there any questions I have one so

369
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,200
do you think that you could combine your

370
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:16,460
ideas with the ones from the previous

371
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,330
organizations in order to prove yes yeah

372
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:21,820
of course

373
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:21,820
and it might provide better applications

374
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:29,870
can match perfectly you have started

375
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:35,120
troops at least have you started to look

376
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:35,629
at these looking forward and thank you

377
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,939
thank you

378
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:43,010
any other questions if there are no more

379
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,630
questions then we'll go in to lunch that

380
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,970
will be at the first floor and we'll be

381
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,490
back at 2:00 thank you thank you to all

382
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,740
the speakers

383
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,740
[Applause]
