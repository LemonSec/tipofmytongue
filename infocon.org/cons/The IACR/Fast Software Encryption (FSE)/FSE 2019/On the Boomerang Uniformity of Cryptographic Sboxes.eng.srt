1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,220
hi welcome to everyone to the second

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,219
session of today which is a session on

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,809
boomerang attacks and the first talk on

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,670
the boomerang uniformity of

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,450
cryptographic s-boxes is going to be

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,100
given by an canto thank you so what I am

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,500
presenting here is a joint work with

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,830
Kristina Barrois and its work on

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,948
boomerang connectivity tables of s-boxes

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,810
so this boomerang connectivity tables

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,480
this is a new notion introduced by

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,969
Carlos Eden his coffers at last year

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,760
crypt and this is of course with 82

14
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,520
boomerang attacks so boomerang boomerang

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,269
attacks as you all know is a notion

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,730
introduced by David Wagner 20 years ago

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,039
and it can be seen as a generalization

18
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,860
of different rock optimizers in the

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,870
sense that it uses two different

20
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:55,379
differentials one for each half of the

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,780
cipher so more precisely what we do is

22
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:02,010
that we divide the cipher into two

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:05,099
halves G 0 and E 1 here and so we first

24
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,408
consider a differential ad for the first

25
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,210
half of the cipher which means that with

26
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,540
a high probability of a considerable

27
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,048
period of plaintext P and P plus a and

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,720
we take four images under easy Rovin we

29
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,780
get two elements which differ from D and

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,789
so now from these two elements what we

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,560
can do is that we can consider a second

32
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,439
differential now for the second half of

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,009
the cipher so this is a differential CD

34
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,869
and so if we add C to the two elements

35
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,960
that have been previously obtained then

36
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,180
we get a quartet and if we take the

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,729
image of this quartet under the second

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,070
half of the cipher we get two pairs of

39
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,740
cipher texts which differ from B with a

40
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,020
high probability and now the nice point

41
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,449
is that by construction the plaintext

42
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,658
corresponding to these two cipher texts

43
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:58,290
here that if we differ from a with a

44
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,049
probability P so this boomerang attack

45
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,540
it's based on the fact that with a high

46
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,329
probability when we take two plain text

47
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,729
which differ from a compute the cipher

48
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,879
text ads B to the true cipher text and

49
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,660
then invert the block cipher even we get

50
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,730
two plain

51
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,490
which differ from a with a high

52
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,950
probability and this probability is

53
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,900
actually the product of the squared

54
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,750
probabilities of the two involved

55
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,400
differentials of course this holds under

56
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,530
the assumption that the two

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,860
probabilities involving the two halves

58
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:34,200
of the cipher are independent the

59
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,530
problem is that in most practical cases

60
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,470
with independence assumption fails so

61
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,720
this was first proved by Sean Murphy who

62
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,090
even showed that in some practical cases

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,480
the previous probability is equal to

64
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,180
zero and also some cases where this

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,820
probability is much higher than what is

66
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,220
expected from the previous formula so

67
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,769
for this reason Dunkleman Keller and

68
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,830
chamois of a proposed instead to divide

69
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:05,340
the cipher knot into two halves but into

70
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,740
three parts where the middle part is e/m

71
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,320
is very small typically it's one single

72
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,230
round or a single sbox layer of the

73
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,350
cipher and so the idea is to concentrate

74
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:19,350
with dependencies in this middle layer

75
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,480
here in this middle part and to study

76
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,790
carefully what happens for this middle

77
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,920
part so the difference between what we

78
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,100
had previously and this probability is

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,019
that now it does not involve several

80
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,910
rounds of the cipher but a much simpler

81
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,000
transformation which is typically one

82
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:40,260
sbox layer and so what is nice is that

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,120
if this middle transformation is an sbox

84
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,030
layer which is composed of several

85
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,940
copies of the same or of different but

86
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,160
smaller s boxes the envyus means that we

87
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,250
can compute with probability but for the

88
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,950
individual s boxes and so this becomes

89
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,890
feasible and so this is a nice

90
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:02,310
observation made at last your crypt by

91
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,488
our series covers what we observed is

92
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,380
that what we could do is exactly the

93
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,510
same thing as what we usually do for

94
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,109
studying the differential properties of

95
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:16,320
a nice box by computing its difference

96
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:19,020
distribution table here exactly in the

97
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,560
same way what we could do is compute for

98
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:25,049
a given s box this probability is a

99
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,820
number of solutions of this equation for

100
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,760
all post

101
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,640
purrs of differentials a B and we can

102
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,760
store these values in a table exactly as

103
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:37,340
we do for the D DT and this table is

104
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:42,950
named a boomerang connectivity table

105
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:45,289
means BC T for short so here is an

106
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:48,110
example so this is an example for a

107
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:51,830
4-bit s box so what you have on the left

108
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:54,950
here is DDT of the S box and I will use

109
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:58,820
this notation Delta of a and B to denote

110
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:02,510
the entry at row a and column B of this

111
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:05,540
DDT and as you all know one of the most

112
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:08,719
relevant parameters related to these DDT

113
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,090
versus the maximal value for its entries

114
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,270
of course when the inputs difference is

115
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,219
not zero and so this maximal value in

116
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,740
the DDT it's what is called the

117
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,290
differential uniformity of the S bus and

118
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,930
in that case this differential

119
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,720
uniformity is equal to four and so what

120
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,810
you have on the right now is the B city

121
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,510
of the same as box and you can observe

122
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,880
that it looks a bit similar to the DDT

123
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,740
well there are some differences so for

124
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,940
instance you have some entries equal to

125
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:43,640
6 here in the bc t and also you can see

126
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:48,040
that all values in the first column and

127
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:51,380
the first row of the bc t or equal to 16

128
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,880
so actually the fact that the first all

129
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,880
entries in the first row and first

130
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,490
column is ABC T or equal to 2 to the M

131
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,710
this is obvious and this was already

132
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,470
observed in the original your grits

133
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,479
paper well if we come back to the

134
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,690
definition of the entries in the BC T

135
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:12,050
and just replace either A or B by 0 then

136
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:15,170
you can see that all values of X satisfy

137
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:18,050
this equation so this means that what is

138
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:20,780
as a relevant quantity is the maximum

139
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,120
value we can have in the B city but of

140
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,820
course if we do not consider the first

141
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,490
row and first column and so by analogy

142
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,540
with the DDT we decided to call this a

143
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:35,660
boomerang uniformity of the sbox

144
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:38,660
so our first observation made in the

145
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:41,780
real York paper is that all entry

146
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:44,330
in the bee city or greater than or equal

147
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:47,900
to the corresponding entry in the DDT

148
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:50,390
and verse a very interesting case where

149
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,929
these two values are equal everywhere

150
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:56,960
which is the case where the ass box is

151
00:06:53,930 --> 00:07:00,710
an APN permutation APN means that all

152
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,400
values in its DDT or equal to zero or

153
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:07,370
two and so what is very nice is that

154
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,289
with APN permutation they even have both

155
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,720
differential uniformity and brahmam

156
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:14,150
uniformity which are both minimal and

157
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,460
equal to two which is very nice because

158
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,620
we offer an optimal resistance to

159
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,690
differential attacks and then this means

160
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,660
that also very provide a very good

161
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,490
resistance to boomerang attacks and so

162
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,250
the bad point is that these APN

163
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:31,100
permutations who are very nice but they

164
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:34,100
only exist as far as we know for a

165
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,570
number of variable which is odd or when

166
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,030
the number of variable is six because

167
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:41,210
for n equal to 6 we know as per an

168
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:44,239
example of APN permutation and so for

169
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:46,729
all other values of n1 and is even in

170
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,160
different from six then we do not know

171
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:52,250
such APN permutation and then the

172
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,550
question of what is the lowest possible

173
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:58,190
boomerang uniformity for such as boxes

174
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:01,630
this is an open problem which was raised

175
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:05,330
in the your crypt paper and so work

176
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:07,640
mainly focus on this open problem and so

177
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,710
what we did here in this word is that we

178
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,740
first prove that the lowest possible

179
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:17,060
boomerang uniformity for a 4-bit sbox

180
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:22,160
it's equal to 6 and we also provide a

181
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:24,230
new formulation of the definition of the

182
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,900
the entries in the boomerang

183
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:30,470
connectivity table of the ass box and

184
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:33,590
this new form formula it's really nice

185
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,750
and it's easier to handle especially

186
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,660
when we consider s boxes with

187
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,729
differential uniformity for and thanks

188
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:44,120
to this formula what we have been able

189
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:47,150
to do is to compute the B city of to

190
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,520
infinite families of S boxes we invent

191
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,890
an inverse mapping and some quadratic

192
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,670
pourer function over the field with 2 to

193
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:57,680
be an element

194
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:59,540
when n is even so let me first with some

195
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,709
preliminary result which was quite

196
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:06,980
helpful for studying for bit as boxes

197
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:09,109
this is what happens on the bc t when we

198
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:12,230
consider some s boxes which are

199
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:14,510
equivalent so we first consider two s

200
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,850
boxes F and G which are affine

201
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:20,329
equivalent which means that G is

202
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:23,089
obtained from F by composing it on the

203
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:25,519
left and right by to affine permutations

204
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:27,529
and when what happens to the beseech is

205
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,350
exactly the same as what we have for

206
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:34,850
rigidity which means that obesity of G

207
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:37,940
is the same as the obesity of F up to a

208
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:40,490
linear permutation of the rows and of

209
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,519
the columns of the BC T but which means

210
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:46,670
in particular that both the S boxes they

211
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,339
have the same boomerang uniformity also

212
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:53,420
a very simple observation is as that

213
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:55,279
exactly as for the DDT the B city of the

214
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,089
inverse of an S box this is the

215
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,550
transpose of the BCG of the S box itself

216
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:04,490
what is different from what happens for

217
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,339
the DDT is that the boomerang uniformity

218
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,980
is not invariant under what is called

219
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:11,930
extended affine equivalence extending

220
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,500
the find equivalence means that we

221
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:17,719
compose the S box by to find

222
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:21,700
permutations as before but we add to the

223
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:24,200
result another affine function and then

224
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,060
differential uniformity is invariant in

225
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,630
Reverse equivalence but this is not the

226
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:32,270
case of boomerang uniformity anyway is

227
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:35,149
the fact that boomerang uniformity and V

228
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:38,270
is a set of all entries in the bc t is

229
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:40,640
invariant under fine equivalence this

230
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:43,490
was very helpful for studying 4-bit s

231
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,589
boxes because it's enough to study one

232
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,410
representative for each equivalent class

233
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:50,240
so this is exactly what we did so

234
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,120
remember we would like to know the

235
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,260
lowest possible boomerang uniformity for

236
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,050
4-bit sbox

237
00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:00,890
we know that this value cannot be equal

238
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:02,420
to 2 because the boomerang uniformity is

239
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,310
greater than or equal to the

240
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,930
differential uniformity which is at

241
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,989
least 4

242
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:10,809
in the case of 4-bit s-boxes and so what

243
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:13,629
we did is that we consider all four bits

244
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:16,449
as boxes with differential uniformity

245
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:19,209
exactly four and actually we considered

246
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:21,399
one representative for each equivalent

247
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:24,399
class and also we considered one element

248
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:27,339
among the as box and its inverse and so

249
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,009
we used classification due to list of

250
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:32,589
the Kenya for this and so we have

251
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:35,589
computed differential unabomber and

252
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:37,689
uniformity of all these s boxes and for

253
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:40,629
each of them we have computed the number

254
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:41,589
of occurrences of the different values

255
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:43,420
in the DCT

256
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:46,839
this means for example that for this

257
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:50,259
first S box it has Boomerang uniformity

258
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:54,100
6 and in the bc t we have 120 values

259
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:58,209
equal to 0 60 entry is equal to 215

260
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:00,910
equal to 4 and 30 equal to 6 and as you

261
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:03,489
can see from this table if we consider a

262
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,829
4-bit s box with differential uniformity

263
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:09,579
for 4 then what we can find as a

264
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:14,258
boomerang uniformity is 6 or 8 or 10 or

265
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:19,378
16 and you can also notice that the

266
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:22,929
values 12 and 14 never appear in the BCT

267
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:24,790
so what we can deduce from this is first

268
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:27,449
that as the smallest boomerang

269
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:31,240
uniformity for a 4-bit permutation is

270
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:35,258
exactly 6 and we are two equivalence

271
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,009
classes here for which we get as low as

272
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:40,059
possible

273
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:42,879
boomerang uniformity and something which

274
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:45,219
is a bit more interesting is that by

275
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,980
trying to understand the previous

276
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:52,959
classification and some interesting

277
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:54,939
observation then we really so that a

278
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,008
very exists another formula for

279
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:59,589
computing these elements are in the

280
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:01,749
obesity which is very helpful in the

281
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:04,480
case of S boxes with differential

282
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:06,850
uniformity for so if we come back to the

283
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,009
definition of the entry at row a and

284
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,899
column B in the obesity which

285
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:14,079
corresponds to the number of solutions

286
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:16,509
of this equation and now this equation

287
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,050
it can be divided into two parts

288
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:20,930
depending on

289
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:23,959
the difference between s of x and s of X

290
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:26,859
plus a and indeed if we fix this

291
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:29,390
difference to a fixed element gamma

292
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:32,839
fenves means that in this equation we

293
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:35,750
can replace with s of x plus a by s of x

294
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,180
plus gamma here and so what it means is

295
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:41,180
that this number of solution of this

296
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,339
equation well for computing it we only

297
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,519
need to compute the number of X which

298
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:48,950
satisfies both equations together for

299
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,930
any fixed K for a fixed gamma and then

300
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,529
we just have to take the sum of these

301
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:56,329
numbers over all possible nonzero gamma

302
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:58,970
so the first case which is interesting

303
00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:01,310
is that when gamma is equal to be even

304
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,560
it's not difficult to see that these two

305
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,930
equations were exactly the same so in

306
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,810
that case which means that the number of

307
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,310
X which satisfy both equations that's

308
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,640
exactly the number of X which satisfies

309
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:18,229
the first one which means the elements

310
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:21,980
at row a and column B in the gdt and now

311
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:24,020
when gamma differs from B then I will

312
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,170
introduce in order to understand what

313
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,510
happens we set V of a gamma is

314
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:32,270
calligraphic v what is this this is

315
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,050
nothing else when the outputs of the

316
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,899
sbox

317
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:38,180
which satisfies the differential a gamma

318
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:41,060
and so if you look at the blue equation

319
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,729
then this blue equation exactly means

320
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:46,430
this is a definition of V set V of a

321
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:49,970
gamma this exactly means that s of X

322
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:52,370
belongs to the set V of a gamma and then

323
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:55,310
after some easy manipulation it appears

324
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:58,310
that the red equation it exactly means

325
00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:01,430
that s of X plus B belongs to exactly

326
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:04,250
the same set V of a gamma in other words

327
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:06,589
an element's satisfy both equations even

328
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,470
only if s of X belongs to the

329
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:12,620
intersection between V of a gamma and

330
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:15,410
the same set but after translation by

331
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:18,110
some of by V offset V and this is

332
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,480
exactly what is in written here in this

333
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,990
formula now we have a new formula for

334
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,740
the elements at cut row a and column B

335
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:30,610
in the bc t this is exactly the sum of

336
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,079
the same elements which into d DT so we

337
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,680
corresponds to the case where gamma

338
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,769
equal B in the formula plus the sum over

339
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,899
all game gamma different from zero and B

340
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:43,750
of the size of the intersection between

341
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:46,990
this set V of a gamma and its

342
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:50,620
intersection of the same sets but after

343
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,630
translation by B so with this formula we

344
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,750
of course recover the fact that the

345
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:59,920
entry in the obesity is at least the

346
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:03,430
value of the entry in the DDT but it

347
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,729
does not look so nice but actually it's

348
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:09,099
it's easier to handle in a very specific

349
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,310
case which is the case where all this

350
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:17,200
sets V of a gamma are affine subspaces

351
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:19,750
and this S boxes were all these V of a

352
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,209
gamma or fine subspaces they have been

353
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,700
widely studied and this is what or what

354
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:28,119
is called planar permutation so this is

355
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:31,560
a notion introduced by Johan and Vincent

356
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,510
and so a case of this planner

357
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,029
permutation or the S boxes with

358
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:39,610
differential uniformity less than or

359
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:42,279
equal to 4 so this is exactly the case

360
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:44,110
were interested in and so what happens

361
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:47,019
if we look at the previous formula in

362
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:50,560
that case is that via sets V of a gamma

363
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:53,529
and its translation by B both of these

364
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,109
sets were Co sets of the same linear

365
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:59,439
space and so I will denote this linear

366
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:02,199
space by this V but now in in Roman type

367
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,480
and so what happens if we consider two

368
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:06,938
Co sets of the same linear space when

369
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,730
were two possibilities only even they

370
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:11,799
are exactly the same or we are disjoint

371
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,380
which means that the size of this

372
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:17,109
intersection it's either zero or it's

373
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,049
the size of the whole the whole set here

374
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:23,020
which is exactly Delta of a gamma the

375
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:26,319
value that we have in the DDT and so the

376
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:29,168
condition under which those two Co sets

377
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,720
of the same linear space or exactly the

378
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:34,720
same well this is exactly the fact that

379
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,690
we offset B belongs to the corresponding

380
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,940
linear space so this means that V entry

381
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,580
we have to compute in the obesity this

382
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,630
is a sum of the entries we have in the

383
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,050
DDT in

384
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:51,930
same rule but for all columns sir Gama

385
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:54,340
such that B belongs to the Leonor set

386
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:57,130
corresponding to the differential a

387
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,560
gamma so let me have a look quickly at a

388
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,870
small example to make it a bit more

389
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,000
concrete so suppose that I would like to

390
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:07,449
compute some value for instance this one

391
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,550
in the B city of our previous earth box

392
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:12,430
which is a nice box with differential

393
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:19,379
uniformity for and so I would like to

394
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:22,720
find the entrance obesity in at Row 1 of

395
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,760
this earth box so this means from the

396
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,540
previous formula that I have to consider

397
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:33,430
all entries in the DDT in the same row

398
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:36,370
and then I have to compute the sets V of

399
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:39,430
a gamma for all valid so a is not one

400
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:41,649
for all valid differentials here so if

401
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:44,140
we I look at all those sets verse one

402
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:47,020
set of size four and all the other ones

403
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:49,870
they have size too so let me compute

404
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,780
both sets so we are here they are all

405
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:55,330
affine subspaces because we as box has

406
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:58,030
differential uniformity for so you can

407
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,429
see that verse one which is which has

408
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:02,110
size four and actually this is not an

409
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,840
affine subspace this is only your

410
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:07,240
subspace it contains zero and all the

411
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,000
other ones we have size tooth or affine

412
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,070
subspace and actually it's very easy to

413
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,100
compute them because it's not difficult

414
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:18,010
to see that via sets if it's if it has

415
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:20,260
size 2 when the linear subspace

416
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:23,980
corresponding to it consists of two

417
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:27,640
elements 0 and V output difference and

418
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:30,940
so if I want now to deduce from that the

419
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,610
value the entry in the B City at Row 1

420
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:36,730
and column 6 then what I have to do is

421
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:40,510
to just have a look at all these linear

422
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:42,850
subspaces and then I have to add the

423
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:46,570
sizes of all these linear subspaces

424
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:49,090
which contains a value 6 and so I have 2

425
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,330
of them 4 plus 2 which means that the

426
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:55,179
variant wins obesity is exactly 6 and so

427
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,740
from this very small example you can see

428
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,920
it may

429
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:02,610
stay fat because when oh when all this

430
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,830
with all these sets here of size do two

431
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:07,169
or all these joints of course if we

432
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,570
forget about the zero value this means

433
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:13,350
that if in the role of the obesity

434
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:16,139
I have only one value for and then zeros

435
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,629
in twos then I cannot get something

436
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:21,510
which is higher than six in the BCT and

437
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,970
so by this simple formula we have many

438
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:26,700
observation like this on on the BCG

439
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:29,400
orbit S boxes for instance if the DDT

440
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,679
has a row with at least two values for

441
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,590
when the boomerang uniformity Z is

442
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,620
greater than or equal to eight and on

443
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:40,080
the contrary if all rows in the DDT has

444
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,360
at most two values for when the

445
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,280
boomerang uniformity is at most ten and

446
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,949
also something which was already

447
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,350
observed in the uroclub paper is that if

448
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:52,679
one row in the DDT has exactly four

449
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:54,990
value for then the boomerang uniformity

450
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,290
of the sbox is maximal and equal to

451
00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:00,240
sixteen so something which is now much

452
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:03,000
more interesting that Manville's

453
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,330
is that using this formula we have been

454
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,420
able to compute the differential uniform

455
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:12,240
uniformity of two infinite families of s

456
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,970
boxes the first one is we inverse

457
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,040
mapping over the field F 2 to V n when n

458
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:20,520
is even and this of course includes the

459
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,830
AES sbox and so what we proved is that

460
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:27,000
the boomerang uniformity of the inverse

461
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:30,230
mapping this is equal to 4 if the number

462
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,020
of variables n is equal to 2 modulo 4

463
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:37,200
and it's equal to 6 if N is a multiple

464
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:39,240
of 4 and actually what we proved is

465
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,690
something which is much more precise

466
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,910
because we proved that the BC T of the

467
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:49,110
inverse mapping is exactly the same as

468
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:52,320
its DDT except for two values in each

469
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:55,979
row which are equal to 6 when N is a

470
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,189
multiple of 4 and equal to 4 when n is

471
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:02,460
congruent to 2 modulo 4 so this is the

472
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:05,400
first infinite family of s boxes with

473
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,530
this boomerang uniformity equal to 4

474
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,420
which is the lowest boomerang uniformity

475
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:12,300
we can have of course unless

476
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:15,600
we can find some Appian permutations for

477
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:19,260
this number of variables and we also

478
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:23,399
looked at a second infinite family of s

479
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:26,100
boxes which are F s boxes with algebraic

480
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,740
degree two with also differential

481
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,750
uniformity equal to four so first we

482
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,960
have a general results which proves that

483
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:36,960
any permutation with differential

484
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:40,800
uniformity for and algebraic degree - it

485
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:44,160
has Boomerang uniformity at most 12 for

486
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:47,220
any number of variables and also we

487
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:50,100
focused on a particular example of such

488
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:53,340
as boxes which have those permutations

489
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,530
here X raised to the board - to the T

490
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,290
plus 1 over the field with 2 to VN

491
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:01,950
elements whereas the GCD between T and

492
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:05,700
the number of variables is exactly 2 and

493
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,890
this is for n equal to 2 mod 4 so this

494
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,670
includes for example X raised to the

495
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:14,400
power 5 when T is equal to 2 and then

496
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:17,970
what we have proved is that all these

497
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,790
permutations when n is congruent to 2

498
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:23,430
mod 4 they have both differential

499
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:26,970
uniformity and Boomerang uniformity

500
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:29,970
equal to 4 so again this is an infinite

501
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:34,050
family of s boxes with the lowest

502
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:37,130
possible Boomerang uniformity which was

503
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:41,129
for two minutes so this is my conclusion

504
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:45,630
so so a quick conclusion the conclusion

505
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:48,210
of this work is that the most important

506
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:51,660
result is that the lowest possible Bruma

507
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:54,000
uniformity for an n-bit s box so it was

508
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:57,180
known before that it was equal to 2 when

509
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,030
n is odd or n equal to 6 and these two

510
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:03,510
is achieved only by a pn permutation and

511
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:06,090
so what was open is what happened in in

512
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:09,900
the other cases and what we proved is

513
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:13,560
that we can achieve for 4 when n is

514
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,740
equal to 2 mod 4 and so we have

515
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:19,710
exhibited two families of permutation

516
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:22,290
for which this 4 is obtained as both

517
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:25,200
differential uniformity and boomerang

518
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:27,810
forma T and we also have exhibited some

519
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,240
some families of permutation for which

520
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:32,190
the boomerang uniformity is equal to 6

521
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,680
while the differential uniformity is

522
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:39,000
equal to 4 so this is in the case where

523
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:42,000
n is a multiple of 4 and so we do not

524
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,400
know whether we can get some s boxes

525
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,920
with both differential uniformity and

526
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,320
boomerang uniformity equal to 4 in the

527
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,470
case where n is a multiple of 4 and so

528
00:24:49,320 --> 00:25:02,870
this is the remaining open problem thank

529
00:24:52,470 --> 00:25:02,870
you thank you so other any questions one

530
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,220
just a quick question does the for

531
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:14,419
instance for the 4b test boxes do the

532
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:17,640
families where you can get minimum BC

533
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:19,200
boomerang uniformity correlate with some

534
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,520
other good properties of these boxes

535
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,920
like for example Emond above

536
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,100
differential of a solution for the

537
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,020
differential equations or branch number

538
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:32,639
well actually these two families are

539
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:34,680
exactly the one that I photography

540
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,410
elements of the infinite families well

541
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:41,610
these are exactly this inverse mapping

542
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:44,670
and socratic function so far only two

543
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:51,120
and yeah you have the list here but one

544
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:53,790
has but one has degree 2 and the other

545
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,790
one is very inverse mapping and we all

546
00:25:53,790 --> 00:26:00,030
have the optimal linearity if you look

547
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:02,159
this or these two boards in the

548
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:04,889
classification depends on the linearity

549
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,900
so these are V optimal as boxes which

550
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:10,830
has the best differential and linearity

551
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:12,180
those one have a higher linearity and

552
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,980
then you can see that the boomerang

553
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,710
uniformity is higher I don't know why

554
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,930
it's correlated but I don't know if it's

555
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:22,050
a consider so much okay thank you okay

556
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:23,910
thank you very much there are no more

557
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,169
questions we will think and again for

558
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:31,219
our presentation

559
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:31,219
