1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,950
and the next talk is on generalized

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,500
nonlinear invariant attacks and a new

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,559
design criterion for all constants by

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,650
way young-ja yet ow

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,059
Huang Ling and in a space a liqu and the

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,010
talk will be given by somebody else

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,410
namely by avenir Rodriguez well thanks

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,600
for the introduction

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,359
thanks to the organizers for giving me

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:32,189
the opportunity to give this talk

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:36,090
tonight today and I'm an SSP h d--

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,739
student and well they decided to send me

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,840
to give this talk and let's see what

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:45,870
happened okay

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:48,120
so first of all the title is generalized

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,860
non-linear invariance invariant attack

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,449
in a new design creature for rank

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:58,160
constants well we have seen so far two

19
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:01,530
different works and this invariance and

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,099
nice presentations by Gregor Linda and

21
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,909
Christopher Ayane and will give well

22
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:11,970
we'll see I'll explain you this is the

23
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,830
summary of the talk and first an

24
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,310
overview a quick overview of the talk

25
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:20,670
because well we now know a bit about

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,880
this invariance and then I'll talk about

27
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,340
this generalized non-linear invariance

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,390
after that and a concept of closed loop

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:35,840
invariants and some conclusions well the

30
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:38,700
overview is already punched out by

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:43,110
lambda this attack was introduced by

32
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:46,820
total land in sake in 2016 in the asia

33
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:51,509
crypt and well the core idea is

34
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:54,779
considering an and box cipher and whose

35
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:57,030
encryption function is a key in you're

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,590
looking for a non-linear boolean

37
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,149
function such that this relation holds

38
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,840
which means that you're looking for

39
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:09,239
symmetries in the in the block cipher

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,730
okay we call this G a nonlinear

41
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,220
invariant and

42
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,429
when fixing a key we're looking for an

43
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,540
invariant so those keys which admit this

44
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,860
kind invariance

45
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:26,150
I called wiki's and why are they

46
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,920
important because commonly induce

47
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,140
distinguishing attacks on block ciphers

48
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,049
especially in lightweight block ciphers

49
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:37,859
because this lightweight block ciphers

50
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:42,060
are designed specifically with a simple

51
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,830
key scheduling algorithm so this light

52
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,830
with block ciphers are susceptible to

53
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:51,890
this kind of crypt analysis and well

54
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:56,580
this is an example of nonlinear function

55
00:02:51,890 --> 00:03:00,029
defined like this and if the point here

56
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,569
is that if the addition of the key in

57
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,239
after that brand constants in certain

58
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:09,238
cat in certain cases you can have this

59
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,930
relation for instance and you'll have an

60
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:17,120
invariant but some cases well it doesn't

61
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:21,410
work that well and we'll see how to use

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,609
this to generalize this inference ok

63
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,280
there are some vulnerable lightweight

64
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:29,459
block ciphers already mentioned before

65
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:34,590
and this is print cipher icecream

66
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:39,570
Robin sorrow dog is 64

67
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:42,530
I scream scream Dory 64 again and it's

68
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:45,870
kind of vulnerable this meter is 64 and

69
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:48,180
simpler Soraka and norc's and different

70
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:54,269
other words that probably I'm missing

71
00:03:48,180 --> 00:04:00,390
here and after that and viola control

72
00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:04,859
London and rotella proved in 2017 and

73
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:06,839
well they started certain structural

74
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,480
properties of the linear layer to

75
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:14,609
protect the set of block cipher and to

76
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:17,399
this kind of tax and well this is the

77
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:20,579
main theorem of the world and it says

78
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,870
that if you have an invariant to the

79
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,630
little of the

80
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,199
the permutation layer the substitution

81
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:32,469
layer and for the from the linear part

82
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:34,030
then the linear structures the space of

83
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,820
the linear structure must be subspace

84
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,969
invariant under L and it has to contain

85
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,969
all the differences of the keys so this

86
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,650
is a really nice characterization well

87
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,830
it's not a characterization but it's a

88
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:56,979
really nice condition to protect the

89
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:59,889
cipher and also this WL s is the minimal

90
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:02,770
l invariant subspace contingency so as

91
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:06,400
this is as the linear structure space is

92
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,919
invariant under L and it contains all

93
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,989
the differences then this set must be

94
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:14,590
contained in the linear structures of an

95
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:16,800
invariant so as mentioned before if we

96
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:21,460
have a large dimension of this space

97
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:27,789
then the only possible in variance will

98
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:31,510
be trivial okay I think this is the

99
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:34,030
result and in some other cases when you

100
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,729
have the differences that the difference

101
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:39,609
of this of the total space with the with

102
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:42,099
respect to this space they found certain

103
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,289
structure of the S layer which allows

104
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:48,610
you to protect the ciphers again and

105
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:52,479
while using certain Gossett's and and so

106
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:54,550
on but they prove that those three

107
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,599
lightweight ciphers are resistant

108
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:02,710
against this kind of invariant attacks

109
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:05,800
okay so this nonlinear in varying

110
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:08,229
attacks can lead not only to a

111
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,780
distinguishing attack but also you can

112
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:13,750
have different kind of tax in following

113
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:16,869
under different scenarios or different

114
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,630
modes of operation and it depends

115
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:22,570
exactly on this in cipher engine mode

116
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:26,590
and two natural questions arising here

117
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:30,610
are if there are more attacks similar to

118
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:33,150
this and how can we protect the ciphers

119
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,150
against them

120
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:40,490
just a moment ago my lip did

121
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:44,179
well-presented work in which there's a

122
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:48,170
unified framework to probably protect

123
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:51,370
the ciphers but okay the well the goal

124
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:54,800
of the paper is to provide useful

125
00:06:51,370 --> 00:07:01,820
generalization of this invariance and

126
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:05,080
it's in of course as gregor mentioned

127
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,820
before this generalization has to be

128
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,219
useful because you need to have a target

129
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,940
something to attack because otherwise

130
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,710
are just theoretical contributions and

131
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:18,260
that's the main goal of paper to provide

132
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:22,310
this generalizations in to give some

133
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:24,710
targets so the main idea is pretty

134
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,710
straightforward it's the same idea you

135
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:30,169
look for a non-linear boolean function

136
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:34,989
but you also look for a pair pair of

137
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:39,530
cancer well a pair of vectors which in

138
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:41,930
this equation has to hold in it's like

139
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:47,000
you're just looking for an invariant of

140
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:50,320
this of the whole encourage encryption

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,350
algorithm but linear shifts of the

142
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:59,000
encryption algorithm so those are called

143
00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:00,770
generalized non-linear invariants and do

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:14,840
we denote the set of those invariants

145
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:20,120
with u f a1 a2 and so in the tags

146
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:22,549
performed by gregory and you have to

147
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,430
have certain relation with the rank

148
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:28,250
constants in the linear part of the

149
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:35,650
invariants in order to to extend the tag

150
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:38,750
to the whole cipher and but here haha so

151
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:41,449
here in the generalized non linear

152
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:44,300
nonlinear invariant tag you also need to

153
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,700
have certain under certain circumstances

154
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,300
you can apply the tag and those are the

155
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,220
certain

156
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,449
chances that you need in order to

157
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:56,500
perform the tack so I want explain this

158
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:59,300
too much and here is the the proof

159
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:04,640
how can you extend to the whole cipher

160
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:10,849
so you just do some technical details

161
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:14,510
here which I'll skip but the main idea

162
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,959
is the same as before just this allows

163
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:21,170
you the linear relation with this allows

164
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:23,029
you to expand and to go forward to the

165
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,519
next round and under the key assumption

166
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,350
that the wiki assumption scenario you

167
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,640
can extend to the whole cipher and then

168
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:35,570
recover well recover this equation for

169
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:38,480
the plaintext in the cipher text and you

170
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,820
can perform a distinguishing attack okay

171
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,570
this is the second case and it's pretty

172
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:46,940
much the same and after that you can

173
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,920
perform in distinguishing attack using

174
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:54,170
this generalized nonlinear invariant

175
00:09:48,920 --> 00:10:01,959
text normally our invariance and well

176
00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:05,319
just it's important well again

177
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:08,149
so the standard procedure is as follows

178
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:12,110
you you're looking for invariance of the

179
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:13,490
whole of the whole run but this is the

180
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,660
complexity of looking for those

181
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:21,440
invariance is really hard it's like

182
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:24,260
impossible if any grows bigger so then

183
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,390
the main point is to find invariance for

184
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,199
the components of the of the round

185
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:32,660
function for instance you start with the

186
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:36,500
invariant for the S box and then you

187
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:38,630
extend it to Xbox layer and then under

188
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,690
certain circumstances you can extend it

189
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:46,100
to the tune invariant of the L layer and

190
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:48,079
then you can perform then you have an

191
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,149
environment of the S layer in variant of

192
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,680
the L layer and then you have an

193
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:57,560
invariant for the whole round and well

194
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,180
this is one technical property that you

195
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,979
have it that

196
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,729
in the paper of lander in the classic

197
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:09,390
attack of in invariant attack you have

198
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:12,390
this property if L can be viewed as an

199
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:15,000
orthogonal matrix matrix in the degree

200
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,880
and you have a quadratic nonlinear

201
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,030
invariant then you can extend it to the

202
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:27,510
to an invariant of the linear layer so

203
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:31,980
the the this journal is non linear

204
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:34,710
invariant as their name suggests is that

205
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,760
indeed you can have this also for this

206
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:40,620
for this kind of invariance so it's you

207
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,800
can extend them you can extend them to

208
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:49,380
the sbox layer in the same fashion as

209
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:51,930
the classic ones and also if the we are

210
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,080
here working with the SPN network under

211
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:57,180
this assumption and if the linear layer

212
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,420
well the the linear function is an

213
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,339
orthogonal matrix then under the

214
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,189
assumption of quadratic invariants you

215
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,630
also have that generalized non-linear

216
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:11,460
invariants can be extended to the whole

217
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:13,500
run function and well the natural

218
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:17,610
question is our general isn't very

219
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:19,860
useful and the in the paper they proved

220
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,830
that they lead to an efficient

221
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,780
distinguishing attack on ice cream

222
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:28,440
obviously under the wiki assumption and

223
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:31,620
and those wikis are different from the

224
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,800
works before that's the important thing

225
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:42,720
because otherwise they're just classical

226
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:44,729
invariants but here is the point is that

227
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,920
journalize non-linear invariants are

228
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:50,610
just translates of standard invariants

229
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:53,729
so in order to protect this the block

230
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,830
cipher you need also to extinguish all

231
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,730
the invariants for the translations of

232
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:02,280
the vault

233
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:04,770
I mean obviously under certain and under

234
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:09,540
certain circumstances you can perform

235
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:12,240
this attack and this is those additional

236
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,949
vectors that adds up to the invariant

237
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,750
can be helpful

238
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,690
to this thing to perform this

239
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:21,810
distinguishing attack even though the

240
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:26,400
classical attack depends on the linear

241
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:28,650
part and well here those constants can

242
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:32,760
be helpful for eliminating this this

243
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:41,610
impact and well this is the first part

244
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:44,069
of the talk and now the second part of

245
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:48,900
the talk is another generalization of

246
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:52,440
this invariance and and well of course

247
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:56,939
will I'll explain you why they're useful

248
00:13:52,440 --> 00:14:01,710
also and as mentioned before in the

249
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:06,360
paper I would call it B CLR for reducing

250
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:12,570
time the question is if this return is

251
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:17,400
optimal well it turns out that a large

252
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:20,760
dimension of this wlv could prevent from

253
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:23,010
some invariant attacks and regardless of

254
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:28,680
the s layer when the dimension is large

255
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:33,120
enough so but here we're going to sketch

256
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:37,650
why this is not optimal so we consider

257
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,950
the following set we're taking two

258
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:43,459
boolean functions which satisfy this

259
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:49,850
it's like like an invariant but

260
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:52,800
alternating so you need that G 1 and G 2

261
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:55,340
satisfy this and G 2 and G 1 are

262
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,790
constants in the input and the output so

263
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,720
it's it's a really straightforward

264
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:04,140
generalization of the classical

265
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:08,130
invariance and we can prove that they

266
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:11,310
form a linear subspace and also for

267
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:16,410
every invariant every standard invariant

268
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:19,469
the this is trivial the GG the diagonal

269
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,959
is on this subspace and of course also

270
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:24,270
you can you have the invariant in the

271
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,900
complement or here in the same space

272
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:30,890
those are pretty trivial results but

273
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:33,689
usually this is the important fact that

274
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:36,990
usually you have more elements in this

275
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:40,560
CLI than those in dust induced by

276
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:43,490
stander invariance so you can have more

277
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:48,869
than this diagonal and this and this

278
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:52,710
complement thing so as a proof of the

279
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:56,400
efficiency of this CL is invariant

280
00:15:52,710 --> 00:16:00,480
invariant attack in the authors of the

281
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:04,920
paper provided and slightly modified

282
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:08,279
version of Midori 64 and as I'll explain

283
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:11,880
you a little bit quickly how to help me

284
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:16,050
daughter 64 works and it uses an SP n

285
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:19,050
structure so it's uses svox layer linear

286
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:25,740
layer and adding constants and constant

287
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:30,900
rounds in the key schedule well we'll go

288
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:35,400
through it in a second and we perform

289
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:38,310
here in the S layer we perform a sub

290
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,920
cell and which is the permutation and

291
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,290
this is a shuffle so and then a max

292
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,750
column which is part of the linear layer

293
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,400
and then adding the constants and well

294
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,070
this is more or less the structure of

295
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:55,680
the matauri and the variant of Midori

296
00:16:52,070 --> 00:17:02,040
it's the same round function just the

297
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:03,750
key schedule is a bit modified it's this

298
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,290
is just the selection of rank constants

299
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:10,949
it's a bit different

300
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:13,470
well you just need to satisfy this

301
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:16,050
property and other can't run constants

302
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:20,550
can be selected randomly so it's just a

303
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:24,240
bit modified version of Midori 64 okay

304
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:27,659
so by using computer simulations they

305
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:31,260
found that those 2 in functions are a

306
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:34,410
closed loop invariant for Midori 64 for

307
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:37,110
this version of Midori 64 and using the

308
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:39,929
same ideas as before we can extend them

309
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,020
to closed loop invariant the whole

310
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:44,800
cipher and

311
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:48,010
important thing is that they can be used

312
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,590
to perform a distinguishing attack to

313
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:55,830
Midori 64 - this variant of Midori 64

314
00:17:50,590 --> 00:18:00,010
and well here even though the degree of

315
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:02,919
G 1 is 2 and the degree of G 2 is 1 we

316
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:06,810
can still do something it's not that

317
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:14,140
restrictive here in the say L I attack

318
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:16,659
so this gives rise to distinguishing

319
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,220
attack as mentioned but even though we

320
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:24,130
have that the dimension of this wold is

321
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:28,480
large which means that the criterion of

322
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:32,560
BCL R is not optimal at all I mean under

323
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:36,340
this under this new framework of attacks

324
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:42,399
so here's a bit of explanation why these

325
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:45,850
these they the rank is repeat just each

326
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:52,390
a second round and you can prove that

327
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:55,000
this has dimension 64 so I have to

328
00:18:52,390 --> 00:19:00,520
mention that the round constants are

329
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,980
selected not like like just some random

330
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,790
constants and that's it they're selected

331
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:12,850
properly to avoid obvious weaknesses of

332
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:16,120
the cipher so this is then the main

333
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:20,409
conclusion that it appears that this

334
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:23,649
creature is not optimal and one strong

335
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:26,350
or strict design criteria is this one

336
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:28,540
but it's really strong criterion because

337
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,760
you just need to make sure that every

338
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,490
one constant is selected outside the

339
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:38,679
linear structure of all the closed-loop

340
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:42,260
inference so well it's

341
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:45,620
even though probably we can relax this

342
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:48,260
creature in a bit but we need to work

343
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,779
more on it and using computer

344
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,850
simulations one can verify that present

345
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:54,649
prints I'll block all of them are

346
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:59,000
resistant I can against this kind of

347
00:19:54,649 --> 00:20:02,928
attack so to finish the talk because I'm

348
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,130
running out of time and in the paper

349
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:09,710
they introduce mmm these two new

350
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:14,570
frameworks of generalized invariant

351
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:17,450
attacks and works of vain then proposed

352
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:20,830
an unified study of the within the

353
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:24,590
framework of correlation matrices in

354
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:27,379
well this gives more structure about the

355
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,750
classical invariance and also with the

356
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:34,159
the previous work of the previous talk

357
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:36,799
of vile viola show the nice proposal to

358
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,169
study the actual mathematical nature of

359
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:43,940
this inference and in the framework of

360
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:48,500
linear approximations and what what we

361
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:50,360
could ask is if those frameworks in if

362
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,269
we can plug this generalization into

363
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:57,019
these frameworks and how to employ this

364
00:20:53,269 --> 00:21:00,649
structure to avoid tax and well there's

365
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:03,230
a lot of open questions here and we need

366
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:08,529
to further generalize this concepts and

367
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:08,529
to give deeper theoretical analysis

368
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,460
[Applause]

369
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,610
do you have some questions for any

370
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,090
maybe I have a quick question so you

371
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,740
mentioned that there were some results

372
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,780
on the security of certain tweakable

373
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,250
block ciphers like skinny or Montes that

374
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,540
they are resistant to the other attacks

375
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,730
did you have a look at how your

376
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,770
criterion applies to tweakable block

377
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:54,230
ciphers and whether you can find

378
00:21:45,770 --> 00:22:05,900
anything there so you mean here in the

379
00:21:54,230 --> 00:22:09,860
paper of this block cipher you mean this

380
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,440
criterion applied to those it's hard to

381
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,729
say because the criteria is like a

382
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,220
really strong criterion so it's just

383
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:19,370
like the straightforward thing to do is

384
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:22,580
just about linear structures why because

385
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:25,729
we want to avoid slight attacks or the

386
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:28,429
linear cryptanalysis so just avoid them

387
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:32,200
so I couldn't say anything more about

388
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,200
those specific cases

389
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:44,029
okay then thanks again okay thank you

390
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,029
