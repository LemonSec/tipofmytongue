1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,529
next talk is about related tweak

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,880
statistical saturation crypt analysis

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:13,370
and its application to karma and altars

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,410
are mutually guy who and machen one and

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,369
mucha is going to keep the top good

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,189
morning at relax

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,009
thanks for the introduction I'm honored

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,090
to have their chance to present this

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,750
special occasion

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,970
the title of my liver is related to 3rd

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,540
history whole situation crypt analysis

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,760
and its application on camera this paper

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,350
is or Joan's work with careful and my

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,780
supervisor Mishima through verse 33

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,629
called situational checks proposed by

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,059
colored and standard are all implemented

17
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,210
under single key sighting and there is

18
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:55,050
no public check model under related key

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,960
or related chick sighting in our paper

20
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:01,078
we proposed a new preached nurturing

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,989
method which is called related key or

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,310
religion tricks 33 whole situation a

23
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,630
check and we have proved frauds that

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,600
distinguish our seals the in this new

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,119
method our traditional equivalent with

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,770
those utilizing their key or tweak

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:22,439
difference environment piles technique

28
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,570
hereafter we will cover all trick

29
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,220
difference in routes by all technique as

30
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:31,350
KD ib or TTIP technique for shots

31
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:34,770
automatic searching algorithm for CDI P

32
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:38,820
Ltd IB distinguishers is also proposed

33
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,890
at last we mounted a religious chick 30

34
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,880
steak whole situation and the TDI Bo

35
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,399
checks on radios the round cover at

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,798
first let me briefly recorder ki DME

37
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,860
technique encounter nineteen sufferers

38
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,750
proposed by pocket innovator their

39
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,479
definition of here tonight in varrock

40
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,210
Sepphoris whirlpool was proposed by

41
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,509
german and women in the aes book as we

42
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,719
can see each rod Kiki I is XOR into the

43
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,449
state and there until Ron's I and I run

44
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,900
Kiki vero it also acts adding to the

45
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:15,480
stage before their first round wheels

46
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,720
to denote this column vector where each

47
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,869
one's KPI is derived from their musky

48
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,590
camera absolutely the I - one city i

49
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,080
denote solar piles or anti underpass of

50
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,569
learn energy aha and the camera is

51
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,269
absolutely the camera which can be

52
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:36,060
denoted as this equation and then the

53
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:39,750
path of linear ho Gamal ammeter under

54
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:44,010
capture is absent Capra which can be

55
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:48,500
denoted as this from this equation we

56
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,500
have the following conclusion if this

57
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,710
if this equation holds for all linear

58
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:07,640
chill city with absence data not equal

59
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:10,580
to zero in their linear how the Pisces

60
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,609
under these two keys are equal to each

61
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:16,640
other and this is called CDIP condition

62
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:19,250
in our paper with this key div condition

63
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,859
we can give the definition of a key div

64
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,590
distinguisher a key div distinguisher

65
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,200
contains my name in our house as well as

66
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,150
a fixed key difference starter but it

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,780
can be called as a key leve

68
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,930
distinguisher only when they are exist

69
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:38,360
appear on Keith Shahzad circuit if their

70
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:42,170
difference is Durga and the cset fighter

71
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,300
key div condition for each linear ha for

72
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,570
trick our tinnitus sufferers we can give

73
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:52,220
a similar a check method which is called

74
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:54,739
TDI be a check in our paper TDI b is

75
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,290
similar with key Bab since chick header

76
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,960
sim effect on the bios of linear

77
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,179
hallways key for trick our 2:19

78
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:05,150
sufferers therefore we have the

79
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:08,209
following conclusion that if TDI be

80
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:12,200
conditional halls these two bases are

81
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:16,668
equal to each other now let me introduce

82
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,950
our new pro post method related

83
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:23,000
trickster testicle saturation crypt

84
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:26,570
analysis assume their process of their

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,230
target cipher is an inverse 33

86
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:32,480
Constitution crypt analysis one fixes

87
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:37,640
are part of plaintext beasts which means

88
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:39,500
this orbits are fixed and then he or she

89
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:43,640
takes all possible values for the other

90
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:46,419
s beats after obtaining there are

91
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:49,190
several texts he or she considered the

92
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:52,640
distribution of our popular sever text

93
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:56,120
value which means he or she will check

94
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,729
the weather distribution of these TVs in

95
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,730
our new proposed method we also fix this

96
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:03,740
a part of a plan text based and chicks

97
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:07,669
all possible values for the other plan

98
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,830
text base but we encrypt this plan text

99
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:12,710
under related key or

100
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:19,219
related to peers after obtaining these

101
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:21,770
two sets of several texts we checks they

102
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:25,580
we compare value distributions of this

103
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:28,940
two plots in this master they are the

104
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,940
worst Rican encrypts these plant X under

105
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:37,310
different key old trick appears as long

106
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:41,030
as they have some difference data pieces

107
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:43,430
we also found that religious key or

108
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,099
relative t-33 called saturation

109
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,500
distinguishers are conditional

110
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,660
equivalent with key di be all T div

111
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,330
distinguishes since we will apply this

112
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,970
method under trickable blood several

113
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,580
camera we will only introduce third

114
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:02,120
conditional equivalence between related

115
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:05,330
cheek thirty spherical saturation 33

116
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,660
whole saturation distinguisher and TDI

117
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:10,280
be distinguisher for the other

118
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,770
conditional equivalent property we will

119
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:17,000
omit it since it has nothing different

120
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:19,609
with this one before giving their

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,850
conditional equivalence property we make

122
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,470
a decomposition of their target cipher

123
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:27,460
denote their target a cipher with

124
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:30,560
unbeatable oak and cabbage cheek as each

125
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:33,440
atom which believes their input into two

126
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,540
parts that's why there are beach eggs

127
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,250
either pot fixed in our a check another

128
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:44,150
SPDY either part taking all possible

129
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:47,330
values the output of H is also divided

130
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,789
into two parts each one each to and we

131
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:52,700
only focus on the value distribution of

132
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:56,450
each one besides we also define a

133
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:59,570
function t i we are tia is actually a

134
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:03,080
function h 1 when x equals to their

135
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:05,599
constant value i with this decomposition

136
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,450
we can give the following theorem let

137
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,480
gamma lammeter be the linear hole of h

138
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:14,479
with gamma separated into two parts the

139
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:19,100
first part either our beach camera in

140
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:22,580
and mask values on the other piece is 0

141
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,540
the output mask lambda is also divided

142
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,109
into two

143
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,940
HUD's lambda or is there a phase or TBT

144
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,500
value and it cannot be zero

145
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:35,150
under this condition when given a fixed

146
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,570
different starter we have the following

147
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:42,080
conclusion if the wealth is in warrant

148
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:44,560
under really - cheek Pierce for all

149
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:50,060
possible massacres coming lambda out

150
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,660
then these two values these two T values

151
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:56,960
will have some value distribution and

152
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:59,960
the West versa which means symbols

153
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:04,419
implies some value distribution and the

154
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:07,969
similar distribution implies symbols

155
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:10,670
given our run-run distinguisher we can

156
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:13,760
monkey recovery or checks by adding our

157
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:17,000
two runs of shades at first which was

158
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,340
our settle plant XP where X is fixed to

159
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,090
be I and white ticks all possible while

160
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:25,640
else an ism we can obtain these two

161
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:28,489
sides over these two sets of cipher

162
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:32,299
texts by encrypting these plant X under

163
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:34,729
these two chicks and then we get

164
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:37,429
corresponding key bits two options is to

165
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:40,610
TI bellows if they have some value

166
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:43,219
distribution the guests keep is our

167
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:46,250
chicken as red kibbutz otherwise they

168
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,950
will be discarded the probability to

169

third wearables are specific differences

284
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:48,889
we have to rephrase this CDIP condition

285
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:53,269
into a level which means if this world

286

describes some necessary restrictions in

00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:12,199
order to exclude trivial solutions we

292
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,199
have to require that at least one round

293
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:17,479
key difference is nonzero

294
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:20,389
besides equations describing their

296
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:26,360

301
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:41,810
combining all these four parts and the

302
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:46,240
inputs and then input these equations

303
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:49,250
into SDP we can obtain pdip conditions

304
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,189
now we will apply our new cryptanalytic

319
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:46,480
in this big distinguisher these two

320
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:50,920
input masks should have some mask value

321
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:54,040
as well as these two output masks since

322
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,740
we will only add several runs after

323
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,689
they're distinguishable munching related

this two input masks can take all

00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:16,060
possible battles but these two output

329
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,129

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:45,160
we have they're falling conclusion if we

338
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:48,370
fix these two words into fixed yoi and

339
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,870
the cheeks all possible values for y

340
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:55,600
then the X or R value of these two words

341
00:17:51,870 --> 00:18:00,989
will have symbaloo distribution with

342
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,990
their X or R value of this towards

343
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,760
utilizing this ignorant related

344
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:10,300
trickster historical saturation

345
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:12,940
distinguishes we comin to kill recovery

346
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:17,530
or checks on turn around camera 64 and

347
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:20,830
this is there our result this our check

348
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:23,560
is our longest a check result

349
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:26,590
considering out returning Heat

350
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:30,520
besides we also mounted TDI bee attacks

351
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:34,320
on alera round camera 128

352
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:37,570
and this is also the best results

353
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:41,730
considering considering our wedding key

354
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,730
in terms of numbers wrong

355
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,790
my report is finished thanks for your

356
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,790
attention

357
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,300
did you try to apply to any other cipher

358
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:09,129
or is there any specific reason to apply

359
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:14,770
to Carnac well we didn't apply this

360
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:18,850
technique to other servers and I think

361
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:23,790
there is no specific reason for to

362
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:26,969
attack karma I just read other

363
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:33,139
documental cover and apply disease

364
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:36,319
Macker thank you let's aim speaker again

365
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,319
[Applause]
