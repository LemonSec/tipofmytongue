1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
distinguishes an attack on register and

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:10,349
a yes and the authority Lorenzo crazy

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:12,690
and he will give a talk I would like to

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,549
suck isn't this presentation about mixed

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,490
differential kept analysis with which

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,380
motivational about this working so I do

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,538
keep two years ago we proposed the first

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,210
secret key distinguish a four five five

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,560
pound over yes which is based on the

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,210
multiple of eight property and he is

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,490
independent of the secret key of the

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,740
details of the mix column matrix and of

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,540
the details of the sbox

14
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,210
where we didn't propose any attack on

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,070
that paper and it was not clear at all

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,690
if it is possible to exploit this

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,700
property in order to set up a key a

18
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,599
covey attack on six or even more round

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,280
of a yes so as I'm going to show it

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,190
seems quite hard to exploit distinguish

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,739
effective a for a kilo he attack however

22
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,460
we can pose a diff we can pose as a

23
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,099
different question

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,930
so can we reformulate this property in a

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,850
different way such such that we can

26
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,100
exploit this conservation in order to

27
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,570
set up a click away attack and the

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,119
answers to this question is yes and the

29
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,170
possible answer is mixed so differential

30
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,580
keep tonight's that I'm going to present

31
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,310
so the presentation is organized in the

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,240
following way so just one slide about a

33
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,740
yes I guess everyone knows it and then I

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,869
briefly recall the multiple of eight

35
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,580
property the main part of this

36
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,340
presentation is about mix of

37
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,070
differential distinguish a white works a

38
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,810
proof of dissing share in the fourth

39
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,908
part I'm going to show how to exploit

40
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,610
this distinguisher to set up a check of

41
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:40,439
a attack and I will conclude with some

42
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:42,119
concluding remarks so what about AES

43
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,869
well AES is based on the S Pen

44
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,079
construction

45
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,700
it works on tax of sixteen byte which

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,149
argan eyes in our four times four matrix

47
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,710
the key size can be of 16 24 32 bytes

48
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:57,299
and the number of round is 10 pliable 14

49
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,669
their armies composed of three steps we

50
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,799
have an S box yeah yeah so it's now is

51
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,540
the drug in ordinary operation in this

52
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,520
round it works independently in each

53
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,140
byte and then we have two linear

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,239
operation the shift rows which works

55
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,009
independently in each row anammox column

56
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,009
which works independently on each comes

57
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,500
so what about the multiple of it poverty

58
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,390
so let's consider a five-round of a yes

59
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,820
we found in my the final mix column

60
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,230
operation so if the final mix column

61
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,209
operation is not omitted we can just

62
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,950
swap it with the final addition

63
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,680
so it's an ER patient we can always do

64
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,359
that and then we take a set of two day

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,520
32 shows and paint eggs with one active

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,620
diagonal so this means that the tacks

67
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,720
are equal in the second in the fourth

68
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,060
and in the fourth diagonals and they

69
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,380
define the first one and we consider the

70
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,930
corresponding ciphertext after five

71
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,850
round and we can prove that the number

72
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,530
of different pair of soft eggs which are

73
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,120
equal in one fix on key diagonal is

74
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,040
always a multiple of eight with

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,720
probability one and this is independent

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,579
of the secret key of the details of -

77
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,170
books and affinities of the mix column

78
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:02,080
matrix actually we have a much stronger

79
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,030
result so we can start with more than a

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,580
single active diagonals so we can also

81
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,470
have two a free active diet diagonals in

82
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,690
input and we can also consider the

83
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:14,200
difference in more than a single output

84
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,880
ante diagonally not good we think that

85
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,920
to collect and to formally describe all

86
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,320
this result it could be useful to use

87
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,690
the excess pastry notation so this means

88
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:27,820
to consider quintics in the same co set

89
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:29,680
of a diagnosis space and to count the

90
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,010
number of different parasite X which

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:37,000
belongs to the same co set of of another

92
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:41,410
space m so here the index I and J do not

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
the size of this sub space so what

94
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,500
happens now if we try to extend this

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,450
leasing share into a key back into a

96
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,280
takeaway attack for example we can

97
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,140
consider 6 found of a yes we can have

98
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,209
plain text in the same concept of T and

99
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,700
the corresponding cipher text after 6

100
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,860
found well potentially we can get the

101
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,750
final key we can just partially clipped

102
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,510
and check is the multiple of 8 property

103
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,200
or not if not then the guess key is

104
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,609
wrong and we can fit the wrong keys

105
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,390
however we have a problem and the

106
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:12,370
problem is that if we partially decrypt

107
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,619
in order to check this property we have

108
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:18,160
to guess the entire Kim because this

109
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:21,399
property involves the fewest 8 so that's

110
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,880
that is not a problem for a yes 192 or

111
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,859
256 because I mean we can

112
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,409
this attack is Celia more competitive

113
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,390
than brute force but I mean if so

114
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,990
competitive but obviously is a problem

115
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:39,310
for AES 128 because that's pretty fast

116
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:41,260
attack so what can we do with this

117
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,570
multiple of hit property so is there a

118
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,460
way to reformulate this property in a

119
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,790
different way such that we can exploit

120
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:51,130
it to set up a kick of attack the answer

121
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,080
is yes and it's based on the way in

122
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,420
which this multiple of eight property

123
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,370
goals so the idea is quite simple we

124
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,380
have a pair of twin takes p1 and p2 and

125
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,870
we consider the corresponding ciphertext

126
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,090
after five round so assume that they

127
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,180
belong to this a space M or assume that

128
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,830
they are in some anti diagonal so we

129
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,080
know that there exist other payoff text

130
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,450
1 and Q 2 such that the corresponding

131
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,880
ciphertext of the same property but the

132
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,560
crucial point here is that the pair p1

133
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,690
and p2 and ps1 equal-to are not

134
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,330
independent in the sense that detonating

135
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,040
rival of p1 and p2 are in some way

136
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,550
related to the generic inviable of

137
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,200
Kiwanuka 2

138
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,240
so what is the idea instead of limiting

139
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,560
ourself to count the number of collision

140
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,410
and to check that piece is a multiple of

141
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,310
8 we can actually check if the relation

142
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:41,260
between these Bibles both or not so

143
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,590
basically we are going to exploit a much

144
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,840
stronger property but on the others on

145
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,520
the other hand we can use these

146
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,739
distinguished share in order to set up a

147
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,659
kick or attack you just a spoiler so

148
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,100
this is English F works only on a

149
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:59,410
smaller number of rounds so we can set

150
00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:01,990
up it up to four round over years so in

151
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,580
more details let's consider to paint X P

152
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,650
1 AP 2 in the same code set of a comma

153
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,270
space city so this means that the two

154
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,359
paint takes up DFS

155
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:13,240
again in the first column and let's say

156
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,690
that X Y it's at an W at the generating

157
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,400
Bible of p1 and of p2 and for the moment

158
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,530
we assume that the generating Bible of

159
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,239
are different so X 1 is different from X

160
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:27,580
2 and so on so that is deforming so

161
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,130
given P 1 and P 2 as before we can prove

162
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,349
that the corresponding ciphertext after

163
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,430
4 round are in the same co set of m or

164
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,560
if you want R equal in some

165
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,480
anti-diagonal even though if there

166
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,770
exists other pair of green ticks for

167
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,590
which the corresponding cipher

168
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,109
at the same property so they also belong

169
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,429
in the same concept of Tama but the

170
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,370
crucial point here is that we know how

171
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,139
to we know these paintings and these

172
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,419
paintings are simply given by swapping

173
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,460
the genetic Bible of P 1 and P 2 for

174
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:56,830
example in the first one we spoke the

175
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:00,280
first Bible in the second one the second

176
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:02,500
and so on so we are going to mix in the

177
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,739
Bible's we are using a property which

178
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:10,300
involves differences so here the name

179
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:12,789
mix so differential keeps on Isis so

180
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,970
what happens if one Bible is equal for P

181
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:17,440
1 and P 2 then we can repeat the same

182
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:20,020
study just before but now we can simply

183
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,599
replace W with Omega where Omega can

184
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,669
take any possible value so we can swap

185
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:26,469
we can mix the Bible which are different

186
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:30,880
and we can replace the Bible which is

187
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:33,900
equal with any possible value and again

188
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,509
if two Bibles are equal for P 1 and P 2

189
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,489
now why does this poverty odd so the

190
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:41,470
proof of these poverty is quite close to

191
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,810
the one that we gave at UT

192
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,020
two years ago but in the following I'm

193
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,979
going to use the Super's bottom notation

194
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,560
so first of all we have a property on

195
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:53,860
foreground and we want to reduce this

196
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,650
property on 200 years to do this we use

197
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,139
a Teta differential probe for 200 years

198
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,299
which owes with probability 1 so the

199
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:03,280
idea is that if two texts are in the

200
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,690
same concept of deep then after two

201
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,609
rounds they are in the same concept of M

202
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,229
with probability 1 so for the following

203
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,770
is not important to know the details of

204
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:13,599
this piece just beef me that if we have

205
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,940
this property on foreground we can just

206
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:20,110
work on the first two round by replacing

207
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:24,190
and with T you can find all the details

208
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:26,050
in the paper so given P 1 P 2 I'm going

209
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,520
to prove the following so if the

210
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,190
corresponding ciphertext after 2 round

211
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,708
in the same co set of T or if you want I

212
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,719
equal in some diagonal then there are

213
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,159
other pair of green ticks for which the

214
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,649
corresponding ciphertext after 2 round

215
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:43,328
of the same property and this pair of

216
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:45,959
index are generated as before now what

217
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:48,670
is the idea it is very simple so if we

218
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:51,160
consider the plain Texas before and we

219
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,870
prove that this equality disapprove it

220
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,010
is equality odds

221
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,370
the previous result follows immediately

222
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,630
this way easy to check so assume that

223
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,060
these two ciphertext sign in the same

224
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,770
course at of T then if this codes then

225
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,989
also these two ciphertext and the same

226
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,089
concept of D so very easy we have just

227
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,600
to check that we have just to verify

228
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:12,580
this equality and to do this we exploit

229
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,589
the superest box impatient which was

230
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,350
introduced by the dinner designers of

231
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:19,720
yes is define as the S box up

232
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:22,390
concatenated with the mix column the key

233
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,700
addition and des books again so the S

234
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,199
box works independently on each byte the

235
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,180
super has box works independently on

236
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,130
each column estiga not in application

237
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:34,180
obviously but it works independently on

238
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:36,100
each column and 200 s can be written in

239
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,660
this way so we have to shift roast and a

240
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,830
super ass box and then some in your

241
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,930
stuff so simple competition we have this

242
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,160
equality we can just rewrite this in

243
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,540
this way using the super ass box

244
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:51,400
notation well here the plane takes big

245
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:56,380
p1 are defined in this way so we apply

246
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,699
the shifters to the previous payant X so

247
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,959
what happens if we apply the shift rows

248
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:04,300
well remember p1 and p2 to tax in a cone

249
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:06,069
space so the bible's are in there in the

250
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,229
first column but now if applied the

251
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,480
shift rows the viable stock map in two

252
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,130
different columns so each one of these

253
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,970
column depends on a different and

254
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:18,610
independent Bible so that is very easy

255
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,860
so each column of these tags depends on

256
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,420
different and independent Bibles the

257
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,060
superest box works independently on each

258
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:28,180
column the source arm is commutative so

259
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,250
if we take this Sam and we just swap we

260
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,560
just mix the column of P 1 and P 2 for

261
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,810
example like in this case then the decoy

262
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,829
doesn't change and so there is out for

263
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:41,560
this imitating for example in this case

264
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:44,950
if W is equal for at P 1 and that P 2

265
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,180
then the sum is 0 so we can understand

266
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:51,430
that this sum is independent of the

267
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:53,410
value of W ok so we have this property

268
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,810
how can we set up a distinction for

269
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:58,029
around four years while consider P 1 and

270
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,560
P 2 as before and assume that the

271
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:01,959
corresponding ciphertext are in the same

272
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,369
concept of M so they are you going for -

273
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:05,869
J and K diagonals

274
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,480
now we can generate other pair of

275
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,880
quintics by just mixing swapping the

276
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,980
generic in Bible of p1 and p2 and we

277
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,330
know that for 400 years the

278
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,150
corresponding cipher texts are in the

279
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,410
same concept of M which probably t1 for

280
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,970
around a permutation the same event

281
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,250
happens with much smaller probability

282
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,020
this is independent of the secret key of

283
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,970
the details of this books and of the mix

284
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:30,380
column ethics so we can easily

285
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:33,110
distinguish the two cases just to have a

286
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,640
comparison we have other distinguished

287
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,410
share on for round off a yes

288
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,170
so the one that I just proposed requires

289
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,360
two the 17 use an index or cipher text

290
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,729
it can also be set up in the decryption

291
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,610
direction because he's approximately off

292
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:49,120
to the 17 encryption so if you compare

293
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:53,180
to the impossible differential then the

294
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,760
data cost is little smaller but the

295
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,290
complexity is much higher and if you

296
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,000
compare to the integral distinction and

297
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,920
the data cost is much higher but the

298
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,370
complexity I mean it depends on the cost

299
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,079
of extirpation can be smaller and you're

300
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,310
just for completeness

301
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,380
there was another distinguisher which

302
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,750
was because two years ago the yo-yo

303
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,760
distinguisher which requires just for

304
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:18,710
shoes in plain text and for adaptive

305
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:21,290
chosen ciphertext okay so we have a

306
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:23,180
distinction now let's try to set up a

307
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,719
kick of a attack on 5 pounds a yes that

308
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,219
is very simple just try to extend the

309
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,890
distinguish up by 1 round at the

310
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,600
beginning so we start with pair of

311
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:35,210
plaintext of this form so with one

312
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:39,290
active diagonal and we simply compute

313
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:40,970
one round of encryption so we have after

314
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,410
one pound text like piece so potentially

315
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,540
we can repeat the same distinguisher as

316
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,310
before but the problem now is that this

317
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,160
generating Bible depends on the secret

318
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:50,150
game so we cannot work anymore

319
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,130
independent of this independent of the

320
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,170
secret key but we can exploit this in

321
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:59,689
this property to set up a heck of a

322
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:01,219
attack so that is very easy we just

323
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,660
guess the key in the first round and

324
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,620
then we use the distinguisher on the

325
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:08,660
next round to fit the wrong keys where

326
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,300
we remember that the mix so differential

327
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:14,040
property holds only for the secret in so

328
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:17,199
we can exploit this information

329
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,790
so in more details let's consider two to

330
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,300
the 30 pictures and paintings with one

331
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:24,339
active diagonal and let's find a pair of

332
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,899
twin takes P NP prime such that the

333
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:27,820
corresponding ciphertext after 5 around

334
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:31,350
I in the same concept of M where you

335
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:34,149
want I equal in 4 minus J anti diagonals

336
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,880
so the idea is to guess part of the key

337
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:39,640
for example the first diagonal to

338
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,520
partially encrypt BMP Prime with respect

339
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,319
to the gas key to swoop the generating

340
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,870
viable of p.m. P prime so we generate

341
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,589
new tax going to prime then we partially

342
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:52,120
decrypt with respect to the gas keep and

343
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:54,250
then we ask for the corresponding cipher

344
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:58,450
text after five round we fix back to the

345
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:00,100
secret game now we know that if the gas

346
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,440
key is equal to the secret key then we

347
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,170
know that these two cipher texts are in

348
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,570
the same code set of M so if this is not

349
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,339
the case then we can just feed the wrong

350
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,459
keys so we know that take ASCII is wrong

351
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:16,510
and the point here is that when we

352
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:18,160
encrypt when we decrypt using a wrong

353
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,680
guess key basically we generate random

354
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,980
texts so there is no variation between

355
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,479
this cupry cuckoo and co-prime and these

356
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:30,790
two texts and so we cannot expect that

357
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:33,670
they mix two differential properties so

358
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:36,370
what about this attack so if you set up

359
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,740
this attack in this trivial way this is

360
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,690
what I did the cost is approximately of

361
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,089
three times to two different atrocious

362
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:48,820
and paint x and basically the same

363
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:51,550
amount of computation at 52018 so last

364
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,560
year belong to c'mon Kalia and addition

365
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:57,279
here I hope I didn't forget anyone

366
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,680
propose in a an eBook version of this

367
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,970
attack which requires just tooted today

368
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,800
twenty two point twenty five shows in

369
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:06,700
pain takes and basically the same amount

370
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,709
of encryption and as you can observe

371
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,890
this stack is one of the best one among

372
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:16,060
all the talk on five hundred yes and the

373
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:18,670
dot I still competitive whatever they

374
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,390
also proposed a way to extend his attack

375
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,930
on seven round

376
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:25,260
yes 192 and they proposed a parts with

377
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:28,949
practical amount of data and memory

378
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:33,310
that's very nice

379
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:35,350
so to conclude this work we started with

380
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,329
the multiple of eight property and we

381
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,070
found a way to translate it into a more

382
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:41,980
into a simpler and more convenient

383
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:44,620
extinguisher that can be exploited in to

384
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,980
set up a technique of attacks obviously

385
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,230
the work is not finished there are many

386
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,390
many open problems for example what

387
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,640
happens if we apply this distinguish

388
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:56,740
around pickable areas like cipher so

389
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,319
what can we exploit the freedom of the

390
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,800
tweak or can we work in created to it

391
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:06,730
mode in order to break more rounds what

392
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,550
about a yes peer PRF or for a yes so

393
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:13,900
it's this pack works also against this

394
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:16,089
scheme other problems what about if we

395
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,439
try to extend this distinction so for

396
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,390
example what happens if we try to

397
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,850
combine this is English with a boomerang

398
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,110
attack

399
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,270
what about any possible mix so

400
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,770
differential so until now we exploit

401
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,630
property which would with probability 1

402
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,340
but potentially we can also work with

403
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,770
property which was with probabilities

404
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,540
here I started to look into this

405
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,760
direction you can find some result on

406
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,980
this tipping paper but at the moment

407
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,790
they are not competitive it also gets

408
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:44,860
ready to work on this topic and I also

409
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,270
would like to conclude with this message

410
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,460
so I'd like to send a positive message

411
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:51,040
to the community and the positive

412
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:53,110
message is just keeping up in mind so

413
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,510
when we propose the multiple feet

414
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,130
property actually we didn't know any

415
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,920
possible application of these

416
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,410
distinguishes so we didn't know if it

417
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,399
was just off vertical interest or if it

418
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,200
was possible to set up any practical

419
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,710
application so any KIAC of a packet is

420
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,420
this English but now the situation is

421
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:15,850
completely different so after just two

422
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:18,700
years we saw that this radical property

423
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:20,889
can also get to practical attacks so we

424
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,210
have new distinguish a new attacks which

425
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,920
are the one that they just proposed and

426
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:26,110
the one that were proposed at crypto

427
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,910
last year we have new direction of

428
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:30,280
research so for example the next work is

429
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:34,960
thing about this topic and we have also

430
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,980
some unpublished result so the message

431
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,750
that I would like to sign is the

432
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,730
following so it's very important to work

433
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,770
with no techniques it's very important

434
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,110
to try to break

435
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,660
Seifer using no techniques but I think

436
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,889
it's also important to try to consider

437
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,559
competing new idea completely new idea

438
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,150
of Krypton Isis it's true that at the

439
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,879
beginning maybe they are not competitive

440
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,440
as other techniques in the Isha - but

441
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,940
maybe after a few years they can lead to

442
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,300
very strong result

443
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:11,110
so just keeping up in mind that's all

444
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:14,580
from my side any comment or question so

445
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,580
we have plenty of time for questions

446
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:24,130
nobody in the audience okay just have a

447
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,410
small question I think your technique

448
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,059
looks very similar to the yo-yo attack

449
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,650
but we saw in the previous slide yeah

450
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:31,750
can you comment a little bit on that how

451
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,510
is it different than similar so they are

452
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,550
based in yeah because we swap columns or

453
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:38,890
vinyl the difference is that we don't

454
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,809
need adaptive adaptive chosen ciphertext

455
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,910
or adapted to show some paintings now

456
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:44,889
your team you have to work with adaptive

457
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:47,230
shows and subtext so that's the

458
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:49,210
advantage okay thank you

459
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:52,630
okay you wait or four questions in the

460
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:55,830
audience nope still no okay so let's

461
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,830
thank we speak here again Thanks

462
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,079

463
