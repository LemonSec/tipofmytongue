1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,989
this running session is shared by

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,389
policemen on myself very happy to have

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,309
you here so before we start the

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:15,419
contributed talks there were few

5
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:17,400
announcements that we like to make so I

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,990
think you all know let's use to this how

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,959
it works in a rap session we have short

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,439
talks and it's nice if everything goes

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,109
smoothly from one speaker to another so

10
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,240
to do that before every presentation

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,700
there will be a small slide that says

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,230
what is the presentation that's about to

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,149
start and what's the next one you have

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,890
to look at the bottom of the slide

15
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,540
that's a the name of the next speaker if

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,450
you all the next speaker please come

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,920
close to us so that you can quickly get

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,620
on stage so that's what it's going to

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,960
look like we thought that Napoleon was

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,320
quite well known in most countries so

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,670
it's going to be a slide with a

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,989
something representing Napoleon with the

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,149
name of the next speaker so here the

24
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,129
next video is used as a key for the PC

25
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:03,960
Church report and he's already here as

26
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:09,360
you can see okay so but you cannot speak

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:12,150
yet I'm not done also you know that one

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,159
of the most important tasks as a chair

29
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,960
is to enforce a time limit because

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,110
otherwise people would just talk forever

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,179
so you all gave us well when you sin you

32
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:28,170
slide you gave us some expected time

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:34,070
that you were needed and I don't know

34
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,070
what to do what should I do

35
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:58,979
ah okay that's how it works that's not

36
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,759
working I'm afraid we'll have to come

37
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,759
sell the rim session

38
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:29,790
okay thank you so there is an additional

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:31,230
rule do not touch this remote so yeah so

40
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,060
we we thought that we needed some kind

41
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,760
of implement to enforce the time late

42
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,250
and to me the most obvious way was to

43
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,159
use a giraffe we got inspired by this

44
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,670
nice xkcd comic I'll let you read it

45
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,190
later

46
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,738
and oh if you want to use it you're

47
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,260
actually need to get a giraffe so I had

48
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,030
some reason to think that another

49
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,340
arrives on Monday as for and do you have

50
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,560
a giraffe said yeah I think I have one

51
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,120
but I'm not sure if it's still going to

52
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,120
work for the RAM session so let me check

53
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,310
and later that day I got a quite late

54
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,870
email saying oh I found the giraffe but

55
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,840
it might really not be suitable you

56
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:10,049
might not want to use it so and she sent

57
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,310
me a picture and so if you it's not for

58
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:12,780
the faint-hearted so if you're a bit

59
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,560
scared you should cover your eyes

60
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,540
because that the picture she sent me as

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,150
you arrived that's never going to do any

62
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,760
sort of noise again

63
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,379
so then whoa I didn't get well I'm also

64
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,870
getting a good advice she said now maybe

65
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,159
mine your husband arrives Oh Maya do you

66
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,569
have a giraffe blah blah blah

67
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:35,280
so now we have a giraffe this one and we

68
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:37,409
also have a small version of the giraffe

69
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,510
in inside a bowl which is kind of a book

70
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:41,400
a giraffe so what's going to happen is

71
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,099
that one minute before the time limit

72
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,319
we're going to do this and then

73
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,780
figuratively speaking if you go over the

74
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,879

please actually go over time so that we

78
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:04,828
get a chance to do this so now I let

79
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,959

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:25,179
with that Napoleon is calling the first

107
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:27,839
speaker report about FSC this year so

108
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:31,330
the chairs are like a forum and myself

109
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,310
so he is now a journalist if we have

110
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,659
post op missions the triumph a year and

111
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,550
we have rebuttal

112
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:39,580
and we make a decision after two months

113
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,550
of the submission date and all papers

114
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:47,378
are categorized in minor revision major

115
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:49,719
revision and reject well we are aiming

116
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:52,810
to get included in tongues is I I mean

117
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:55,930
having it's Citation Index in 2020

118
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,509
so 2020 is approaching and the editor

119
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:04,389
team team is trying very hard to get

120
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:07,960
citation okay so 36 so this year we

121
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:09,699
received 142 submissions and some of

122
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,159
them are resubmission after the major

123
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:14,529
revision so bike scolding them and a

124
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:17,909
news number but new submissions 122 and

125
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:21,939
the number of submissions increasing as

126
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:24,250
FSC approaches so it's quite neutral so

127
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:27,089
by the way so this is the statistics

128
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:31,089
from last year so last year we received

129
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:36,950
174 submissions and this year it's 142

130
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:40,660
so like 20% like reduction and

131
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:44,120
except beepers also like videos by 20%

132
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:46,690
and so this is a acceptance rate for

133
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,360
issue by issue and the first issue the

134
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:52,940
acceptance rate is 28% and the second

135
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,150
issue is 32% the father is 20 percent

136
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,780
and last one is 24 percent and average

137
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:02,840
is 20 I mean their total is 20 percent

138
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:05,630
and by the way so this is data from the

139
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,929
last empathy and by comparing those do

140
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:12,440
you can see some good strategy to get to

141
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:15,680
your paper so different tree you should

142
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:21,020
submit the June dead wrong as next

143
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,820
deadline so please submit your paper but

144
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,859
actually there is some reason why we

145
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,170
have high acceptance rate in the issue

146
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,970
too and this is a number of resubmission

147
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:32,270
after major revision for each issue and

148
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:34,220
for the second issue or we receive the

149
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:38,060
highest number of resubmission after

150
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:40,550
major revision and we gave a major

151
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,370
revision only if we see some potential

152
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,740
that the paper can can be accepted so

153
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:50,380
basically where submissions of the major

154
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:59,240
revision has high acceptance rate that

155
00:07:50,380 --> 00:08:01,430
is actual trick so we are aiming a

156
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,160
citation indicating Citation Index so

157
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:08,000
when you write other is a journalist

158
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:11,540
like BCC EJ or CEO LM yes please cite

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,790
TOC papers not from ePrint or personal

160
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:19,850
webpage beside TLC papers that help us

161
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:22,430
get Citation Index and everything

162
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,440
published has been reviewed so if you

163
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,620
need more than 20 pages and they go for

164
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,140
one paper I mean even for like

165
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:33,860
supporting material or appendix will be

166
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:36,140
rebuilt everything is reviewed and we

167
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,780
also want s okay paper mean

168
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:42,409
systemization of knowledge but this okay

169
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:44,209
paper still need Sam no Becky I mean you

170
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,219
have to provide something which is known

171
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,360
in the previous saw just like collecting

172
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:52,410
previous information

173
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,149
natsu told okay and the start fire may

174
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,910
need some minor improvements but please

175
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:58,740
don't hack the latex file and we are

176
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:03,140
recommending using a standard big coil

177
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,140
for example the one maintained by Ennis

178
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:12,930
we like to thank program committees so

179
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:16,740
we have 45 program committees and like

180
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:22,109
18 of them are renewed changed from the

181
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:24,630
last year so between 30% to 40% our ring

182
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,959
and we are trying to keep the

183
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:31,800
committee's fresh as fresh as possible

184
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:34,079
and we'd like to thank general the chair

185
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,319
Jeremy for organizing this nice

186
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:40,079
conference in Paris and we also thank

187
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,620
invited speakers Gregor Maria and John

188
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:46,290
and we also track to run station which

189
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:51,200
is I mean run station it's just now just

190
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:55,199
now started but I'm pretty sure Jeremy

191
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,199
tried tried hard to collect a lot of

192
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:00,180
sponsorships are we'd like to thank

193
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:02,189
sponsors and I heard that Jeremy is

194
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,290
counting the page view from the TV web

195
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:07,019
widget responsive web page so if you

196
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:09,870
have time then please visit the TOC page

197
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:13,649
and like push some link then there's

198
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:20,790
gonna be help to Moses in the future 50

199
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:26,670
conference and the technical support shy

200
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:28,939
and vidi vici and finally you need to

201
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:31,529
write to thank all the attendees

202
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,540
okay so by the way hello I direct and

203
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:38,370
now I directly announce based the paper

204
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:41,819
award so we this year we first nominated

205
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,949
nine candidates and they both by other

206
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,100
committees so each county can both add

207
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:50,310
any number of papers except for their

208
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,140
submissions and then the we picked the

209
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:56,459
paper which collected the highest number

210
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,829
of votes and the result the best paper

211
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:01,650
award is given to the paper into thawed

212
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:39,430
partitions in this box of

213
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:41,770
Organic symbols are paper by a label so

214
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,500
the next talk is Omaha asking by Encanto

215
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:47,110
next speaker park religion

216
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,270
okay so first of all as a chair of the

217
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:52,750
steering committee of FSC I have an

218
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:55,449
important announcement so maybe some of

219
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:58,560
you know that this is our competition is

220
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:01,570
over so we now have a nice portfolio of

221
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,920
authenticated encryption schemes and you

222
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:07,180
also probably know that we now have 70th

223
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,729
fifty-seven sorry new lightweight

224
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:13,239
primitives that are or candidates to the

225
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:15,550
nest competition and we think that this

226
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,610
is a great achievement for our community

227
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:21,280
and so within this FSC steering

228
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:24,640
committee we are considering having a

229
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:28,030
special issue of tasks for instance for

230
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,569
all these new designs and because this

231
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:34,150
is important for our community so the

232
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,790
details now are still under discussion

233
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:39,490
because it's not so easy to handle so

234
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,410
many papers but please the message is

235
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,150
first if you were a designer if you are

236
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,610
interested or think that it's a good

237
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:48,069
idea your feedback is welcome so you

238
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:51,070
know people in the steering committee so

239
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:53,020
please just give us some feedback and

240
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,350
the second message is that if you plan

241
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:58,780
to submit as a description or something

242
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,730
around your nest candidates for instance

243
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,920
please do not submit it to another

244
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,560
conference or another drone all just

245
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:11,290
wait a moment and you will get some more

246
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:14,000
details okay so now here's my second

247
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:16,760
contribution which is a cultural country

248
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,070
ocean as a chair of the French symmetric

249
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,340
encryption conference and this

250
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:25,280
contribution is related to hasin which

251
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:27,050
is the French word for root well what

252
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:32,780
precisely root is being English word for

253
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:36,229
machine so jean has seen is actually one

254
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:38,990
of the most famous French writers from

255
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:43,270
the 17th century and he was a great

256
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:46,850
dramatist he wrote many tragedies and

257
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:49,939
what most people do not know is that he

258
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:52,910
was also a visionary cryptographer and

259
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:57,800
he was an expert in symmetric crypto yes

260
00:13:52,910 --> 00:14:00,319
obviously he was not a GCC guy even if

261
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:07,209
it can't be argued that some GCC papers

262
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:11,300
are really like tragedies but Hassan is

263
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:14,450
indeed probably the author of what we

264
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:17,839
think is most famous Alexandrine in the

265
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:23,870
French literature which mentions a very

266
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:28,430
famous block cipher actually porky salsa

267
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:30,860
spunky cifras your debt I don't know if

268
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:33,680
you're on his around but I I'm pretty

269
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,200
sure that he will complain and say that

270
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:41,030
sir poem is probably not the best block

271
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:42,980
cipher it's even not a standard but I'm

272
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:46,310
afraid I am not really convinced by the

273
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:49,990
alternative pork is insane hein directly

274
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:52,819
citrus on with that and even with

275
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:55,430
permutation best cryptography it's not

276
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,380
really convincing like porky sources who

277
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:03,349
do see first you know that wasn't

278
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:06,050
something but nice well but in the

279
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:10,250
following what I will try to do is to to

280
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:13,040
make the importance of the of the French

281
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:15,860
elegance and of haseen accessible to non

282
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,410
native French speakers so I decided to

283
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:21,110
continue with to work in English and so

284
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:25,819
I already explained that Racine is a

285
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:29,360
French word for root and so all

286
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:32,390
this is about tragedy because maybe

287
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:36,910
you're not aware of that but roots have

288
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:39,650
a very tragic destiny in your community

289
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:42,020
they are often underestimate since

290
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:44,329
Monday I could hear many claims like

291
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:47,240
this that the choice of the root does

292
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:50,990
not matter but we prefer to use

293
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:54,380
polynomials without roots and so I think

294
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:56,360
that we really should recognize the

295
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,240
suffering of roots in your community

296
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,100
well fortunately there's a trend to

297
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,920
improve our situation which is due to

298
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:07,880
Grover's algorithm which adds some roots

299
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,550
everywhere but to recognize this

300
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,620
strategy this tragedy I would like to

301
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,030
emphasize the importance in the

302
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,490
diversity of roots

303
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,770
so indeed you are a lot of different

304
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:22,220
roots we usually think of primitive

305
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:31,090
roots like alpha we can also think of

306
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:34,370
beta or gamma or potatoes or carrots and

307
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:39,440
we don't have to forget of course more

308
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:41,600
complex roots like this ones and at this

309
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,810
time at that point I would like to

310
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,720
really thank or general chair Jerry

311
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:51,619
Mitchell for making us aware of the

312
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,590
existence of very complex roots which

313
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:58,580
are these Chinese artichoke that we have

314
00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:01,190
for lunch on Monday so please join me to

315
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,770
thank Jamie for his amazing contribution

316
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,869
to roots so please Jeremy could you come

317
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,888
here

318
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:08,888
[Applause]

319
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:19,150
so is Jeremy on the behalf of our and of

320
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:22,420
the FAC steering committee I would like

321
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:25,180
to give you this back and so of course

322
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:27,190
to to thank you for your contribution I

323
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:31,270
hope you will appreciate this nice

324
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:34,860
carrot collar and I would like also to

325
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,860
thank you for this perfect organization

326
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:43,600
[Applause]

327
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,790
so Jamie really did an excellent job

328
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,580
and I think everyone here in the room

329
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:51,280
enjoys a very nice banquet that we had

330
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:55,030
yesterday so thank you for your perfect

331
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:58,110
organization and your hard work and also

332
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:02,820
I would like to thank or to

333
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:05,679
editor-in-chief of task who serve as PC

334
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:10,230
chairs of this conference so Florian

335
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,230
Mendel and you Sasaki so please

336
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:21,750
you also get served

337
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,750
the black with a nice carrot collar

338
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:34,360
[Applause]

339
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:37,270
so for people for 4pc members you know

340
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,189
that it's a reviewing process of tusks

341
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,020
is something which is really her hard

342
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,870
work because we have a pile of new

343
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,240
submission arriving every three months

344
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:49,540
and so you can think that it is even

345
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,120
much harder for Florian and you and they

346
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,370
really handled all these submissions in

347
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,129
a very nice way so thank you you and

348
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:59,530
flowering and thank you a lot and so

349
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:03,130
finally I would like to conclude to

350
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:09,549
conclude my cultural contribution on

351
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:12,250
roots by an open question with this you

352
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:15,639
know and this open question is a

353
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:31,990
following to be it or not to be it that

354
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:36,059
is the question thank you because ya

355
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:45,210
know Katya please welcome Paul Crowley

356
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:47,230
$4000 talk platform security group and

357
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,559
tomorrow I'll be talking about how we

358
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:52,780
made encryption fast on the kinds of

359
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,639
phones that are low-end phones sold in

360
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,580
developing countries but I'm still not

361
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,270
happy because I need to make hashing

362
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:03,000
fast on an Android device the operating

363
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,410
system is on a read-only partition and

364
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,210
we hashed that partition with a Merkel

365
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:10,320
tree and every time we read from it we

366
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,320
compared to the hash and

367
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:15,970
fast devices that's fine but on

368
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,280
something like this Broadcom processor

369
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,919
we use char to and it's just much too

370
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,750
slow it makes the user unhappy we even

371
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,120
if we switch to something faster on this

372
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,820
kind of hardware like Blake to be it's

373
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,340
still like less than 60 mega second much

374
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:33,129
slower on the underlying hardware and it

375
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,809
makes people unhappy now I could try and

376
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,010
design a super fast hash informative but

377
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:38,770
I think people have tried that before

378
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:40,419
and I don't have a great hope of like

379
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,170
massively improving on the state of the

380
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:47,990
art so what I want to do is make the

381
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:50,940
a little easier so in a hash function

382
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,170
you know this is one model of how to

383
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,870
consider the security of a hash function

384
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:57,210
we say the attacker learned some key

385
00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:00,330
this may be the initialization vectors

386
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,830
for the cipher they choose two messages

387
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,740
which are different from each other and

388
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:07,919
they win if those two messages collide

389
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,690
attacker has enormous freedom you can

390
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,430
like every last bit they can line up

391
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,320
they can try every combination until

392
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,760
they get it just right and so these hash

393
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,399
functions have to really do a lot of

394
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,470
work to be sure of being secure against

395
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,180
these kinds of attacks and it is too

396
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:26,420
slow for my purposes much faster our

397
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:30,420
Universal functions and in this model

398
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:32,340
the attacker chooses two messages which

399
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:35,970
should differ from each other and only

400
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:38,250
then do they learn the key K and they

401
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:40,950
win if the two messages hashed the same

402
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:45,420
value with this key these are super fast

403
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:48,420
NHS 1.5 cycles per byte but I can't use

404
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:50,370
this in Android what I'll sign will have

405
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,840
to include the key the attacker gets the

406
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,669
key and once you've got the key it's

407
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,149
really easy to generate a collision with

408
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,800
a universal fast Universal function so

409
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:03,000
this isn't gonna going to do for my

410
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:05,700
purposes the Goldilocks position is the

411
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,850
target collision resistant function the

412
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,560
attacker chooses a message only then do

413
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,270
they learn the key and then they have to

414
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:16,290
come up with a second message that

415
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:18,139
collides using that key so I this is

416
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,740
great for me we can generate this via

417
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,860
partition we're going to put on the

418
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,320
device the last second we choose the key

419
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:29,250
cache the partition and we sign the key

420
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,780
in and the root of the partition and the

421
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,540
attacker learns the key but they have to

422
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,920
come up with the collision they don't

423
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,220
get to choose the first message before

424
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:41,010
loaning the key here's why I'm

425
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,290
optimistic about this this is a diagram

426
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:45,720
that Zuko one of the designers so blake

427
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:48,000
TV came up with and from top to bottom

428
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,420
there you've got a number of different

429
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,400
hash functions from md 2 to blake to and

430
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:56,640
across from left to right is time and

431
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,330
these hash functions turn red as brakes

432
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,480
and the collision was

433
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:02,550
I found so like after about 2000 like

434
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,830
tiger and whirlpool we start to see hash

435
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:07,560
functions which have stayed collision

436
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:10,020
resistant but it's you know there's a

437
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,760
there's a sea of red as as hash

438
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,740
functions get broken over time it's

439
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,250
clearly a hard problem here's the

440
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,600
history of second preimage resistance

441
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,340
which is a problem I think is pretty

442
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,750
closely related to the problem of target

443
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:26,459
collision resistance in all time only

444
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,290
one hash function the Zuko was able to

445
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,240
find has ever had a second preimage

446
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:32,670
attack and that sniff through two and

447
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,710
the attack was found in 1990-1991

448
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:36,540
not long after the hash function was

449
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,460
proposed and so this is clearly a much

450
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,320
easier problem and in the past people

451
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,430
have done this to kind of hedge against

452
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,320
you know there's been research into

453
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,730
target collision resistance but people

454
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,770
have used it to kind of hedge against

455
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,930
here is this cipher secure let's just be

456
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,090
on the safe side I want to use it to cut

457
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:53,250
rounds off and build super fast

458
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:55,530
primitives and so to that end I'm

459
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:59,070
offering a $1,000 prize from my own

460
00:23:55,530 --> 00:24:00,570
pocket just to move this forward I've

461
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,159
got a longer presentation here with some

462
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,600
ideas about how you might use this you

463
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,700
can attack my proposal you can propose

464
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,149
new things you consider a quantum

465
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,520
resistance because TCL's are useful in

466
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:14,580
hash based signatures which are useful

467
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:17,310
which are quantum strong signatures and

468
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:19,199
deadline is the end of the year and yup

469
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,580
plea please advance our understanding of

470
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,470
faster than hash verification and

471
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,199
remember this presentation when judging

472
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,330
the prestigious point clearing with a

473
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,530
coupon a prize thank you so much for

474
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:32,720
your time

475
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,720
[Applause]

476
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:45,629
sorry no time for questions

477
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:50,379
[Music]

478
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:52,210
so next turkeys subterranean 2.0 by

479
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,429
Adele our next speaker on terminal cool

480
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,620
yeah alright it's difficult to say I

481
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:57,490
don't manage myself so I will not say

482
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:01,870
the word hero

483
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:06,669
so subterranean is days bags from 1992

484
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:09,459
and it was lately used in for a high

485
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:12,149
function or sub stream which was the

486
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:15,789
stream cipher and by refurbishing the

487
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:19,360
cipher we just took back on is the run

488
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:21,460
function and make it a sponge for doing

489
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,799
a hash function where we absorb a bite

490
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,929
every two runs and after doing eight

491
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:31,509
runs of the function and we also use it

492
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:35,080
as a duplex thing to do an authenticated

493
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:37,450
encryption cipher but this or he know

494
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,720
about so let's talk about the run

495
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:46,509
position so the run function is so yeah

496
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:49,659
it's applying on 257 state beat you

497
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:53,320
apply a chi my ping on to all states and

498
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:57,250
you have only one run constant which is

499
00:25:53,320 --> 00:26:02,139
applied on s0 and after you have theta

500
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:03,909
which takes three bits and bits so this

501
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:05,620
is written here and after you have the

502
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:09,909
PI mapping for dispatch this person

503
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:12,699
which maps bits at position 12 times I

504
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:16,690
to position I

505
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:20,230
we don't exhort the message before week

506
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:23,740
so in the round because we we delete

507
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:28,960
some gate delay by doing so and what we

508
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:33,429
do for output the key stream we just

509
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:37,960
take as 12 generates multiplicative

510
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:41,260
subgroups of 256 elements we can just do

511
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,480
12 to the power 4 and now we have a

512
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,580
multiplicative

513
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,920
subgroup of the multiplicative group

514
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:52,899
sighs 64 so what we do this is like yeah

515
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,300
everyone likes multiplicative subgroups

516
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,340
I am sure you like multiplicative solute

517
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:01,149
so that's why we did this and we output

518
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:03,189
the sum of two bits and yeah why we do

519
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:05,200
this not because we all like

520
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:08,320
multiplicative subgroups is that because

521
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,830
we are we are very lazy we also in

522
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:17,230
software implementation just never do

523
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:21,159
the PI application and we put this some

524
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:25,450
houses PI in both the Chi and the

525
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:27,940
tetum mapping so that means we in this

526
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:31,450
software and premonition you never do

527
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:33,670
the PI and you change the offsets by for

528
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:36,370
defining Chi and for defining theta and

529
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:44,920
touch it but that's why we took the

530
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:47,469
output of G of 64 thank you so next

531
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:50,140
speaker is Antonio Niko and exact a

532
00:27:47,470 --> 00:28:11,730
medium ELP for heavy to run SPSS and

533
00:27:50,140 --> 00:28:16,770
next speaker is Kristina Barrois which

534
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:25,030
satisfies these three properties and

535
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:27,720
typical example and cosmetic and we

536
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:30,899
define two round

537
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:36,940
differential trail and to round

538
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:42,870
differential differential trail s Omega

539
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:52,410
and differential as deep and our goal is

540
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:57,530
to calculate exact MIDP for two round

541
00:28:52,410 --> 00:29:05,720
heavy espía and we can eight

542
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:09,550
as shown on this slide but we need upper

543
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:16,160
balance for non minimum weight

544
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:22,240
differential we have result so two round

545
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:27,530
twos magic and now we design dynamic

546
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:35,080
programming algorithm for bound in non

547
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:42,920
minimum weight differential in two round

548
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:48,260
spin any any actual lesbian

549
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:53,810
for example hazard and we have exact to

550
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:58,490
round em adp on this slide and we have

551
00:29:53,810 --> 00:30:09,169
bound on minimum rate differential thank

552
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:11,810
you very much so in XP courage Kristina

553
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:14,320
Barrois for the FC 2020 announcement

554
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,980
next speaker guy down low on such ona

555
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,080
hello everyone

556
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,800
so I'm Christina Mora and I'm here to

557
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,290
present you a so FEC of next year so I'm

558
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,820
sure you're all enjoying so this year if

559
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,790
you see you that is very well organized

560
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,260
by me and so the question is where is

561
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:34,220
going to happen of course if you see up

562
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:37,879
next year so you have a small hints on

563
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:40,070
this picture so if I see of this next

564
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,700
year will be in essence so that is the

565
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:45,470
capital of Greece the dates are almost

566
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:51,020
as this year so it will be in the end of

567
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:54,680
March so 22 to 26 and why in Greece

568
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:56,780
actually well this is a very natural

569
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,540
place to have a fizzy because Greeks

570
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,500
especially guys from Sparta they already

571
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,540
know about symmetric key cryptography

572
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:07,730
and they use it like centuries before

573
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:09,950
AAS was I was designed okay so on some

574
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,790
practical information so the program

575
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:13,280
chairs

576
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:16,460
as you probably know it's in you Sasaki

577
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:19,428
and the new culture is Caetano home so I

578
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:22,669
will serve as general chair and the

579
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:24,650
conference will be like three days and a

580
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:29,390
half exactly this year so we will end at

581
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:31,210
Thursday on just before noon there is

582
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:36,350
already website you can visit with some

583
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:38,240
preliminary information and so it will

584
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:40,549
be in Athens but we're in Athens so this

585
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,100
will be happen in a five-star hotel that

586
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:45,559
is called royal Olympic Hotel this hotel

587
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,959
is very well situated is just in the

588
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:49,879
historical center of Athens you can get

589
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,640
there from the National from the

590
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:55,910
International Airport by a direct metro

591
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,970
or bus line it is very close so for

592
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:00,260
example to to the Acropolis if you want

593
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:03,650
to visit the Acropolis it's only I have

594
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:05,390
14 minutes do you want to walk and the

595
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:09,169
negotiated price if you decide to stay

596
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:11,780
there it's 130 euros for single and

597
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:14,510
double rooms with breakfast so if this

598
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:16,610
is a lot then no problem there are many

599
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:19,250
other hotels nearby that for all

600
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:21,110
possible budgets okay so these are some

601
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,530
photos from the hotel so this is the

602
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,149
room

603
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:25,160
they've been advanced it's off the

604
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:28,850
conference room is that alcohol is

605
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,169
permitted inside for the transition but

606
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:32,270
of course the room is not the most

607
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:33,799
important the most important is where

608
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,990
we're going to have lunches so all

609
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:39,290
lunches will be served at their rooftop

610
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:41,360
restaurant that has this that's view to

611
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:43,850
the Acropolis or this one if you're

612
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,340
seated from the other side and this is

613
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:48,889
even if the weather is bad so no worries

614
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:52,129
about this and if the weather is good

615
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:54,620
there is also a swimming pool that can

616
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,450
be open for us if yes if the conditions

617
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,399
permit it

618
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:00,740
ok so if you want to come - if I see you

619
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,620
have to probably want if you want your

620
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:06,230
paper to be presented at ABC 2020 then

621
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,510
you still have 3 deadlines the deadlines

622
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:13,340
are like this year so first June 1st of

623
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:15,799
September and 23 of November they tender

624
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:18,500
tea fees it's a little bit like this

625
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:21,440
year so well it has to be addressed

626
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:24,210
adjusted but it will be around a 530 US

627
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,960
dollars for reg

628
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:30,760
yeah for regular fee ancestor students

629
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,510
it will be like half a price as usual

630
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,160
okay so that's all so I hope to see you

631
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:38,200
all in Athens until you have any

632
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,690
questions or most importantly if you

633
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,630
want to be a sponsor for a festive next

634
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:43,990
year you can send an email to this

635
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:51,280
address

636
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:53,170
thank you very much so next speaker is

637
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,790
guy turnaround such renowned the

638
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:59,170
following speaker is difficult but on

639
00:33:54,790 --> 00:34:00,700
the Reeboks contest thank you I'm going

640
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:03,510
to talk about Shana which is our

641
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,620
submission to win this competition and

642
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:07,180
hopefully will be published somewhere

643
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,659
maybe in tasks so that we can go to

644
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,659
Athens

645
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,130
so of course so when East is running

646
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,510
this competition they have two main

647
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,950
requirements right it should be well

648
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,230
studied algorithm and it should be

649
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:21,819
lightweight so of course what did we do

650
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:24,610
well we're designing a new block cipher

651
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:27,910
obviously and we're going to have a 56

652
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:30,040
bit key on state so why are we doing

653
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:32,649
this well it's because we care about

654
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,929
post quantum security because if you

655
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:36,610
look at our team we have Mario in the

656
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:39,520
team so of course it has to be post

657
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:41,410
quantum secure and we move this in a

658
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,840
strong sense we want to resist attacks

659
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:46,779
against a superposition query but we are

660
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,890
necessary so in this q2 model and this

661
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,780
means we have to be a little bit careful

662
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:51,540
on winning a large state and we need to

663
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,700
be careful with the modes of operations

664
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,290
and of course because we have a new

665
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:57,910
block cipher we also need to be careful

666
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,380
about its security so we're going to do

667
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:01,029
something that looks very much like the

668
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:04,120
a yes because the AES of course is the

669
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:05,590
best cipher ever so if we have something

670
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,390
that looks like the AES it could be like

671
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:11,260
the second best so hopefully it will be

672
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:13,080
good enough so of course the main

673
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,240
question why is it called secure now

674
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,759
well further so we want a lightweight

675
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,799
cipher so what is the standard of

676
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,860
lightweightness obviously it's the duck

677
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,210
I mean I'm sure you've all seen Monty

678
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,100
Python of the Holy Grail and we know

679
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,540
that if you want to know if something is

680
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,839
lightweight you have to compare it to a

681
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:34,360
duck so we need a duck name and there's

682
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,440
a famous French duck it looks like this

683
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,330
and it's called such Oh No

684
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,820
so yeah or a submission will be called

685
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:41,060
such

686
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:44,060
now how do we design a recycler

687
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:46,549
well we had a bit of a hint

688
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:49,070
according to Kepler in mr. Hume

689
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:51,140
cosmograd cecum the planet Saturn is

690
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:53,690
associated to the cube so of course our

691
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,650
cypher will be a cube so a state looks

692
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,200
like this

693
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:59,060
so cube and we're going to do bit slice

694
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,850
operations we have nice components like

695
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:03,470
this if you look at the s and MDS matrix

696
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:07,580
maybe you recognize it from one of the

697
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:09,500
talks yesterday about lightweight MDS

698
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:11,420
matrices so those are all very good

699
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,910
components and when we combine them we

700
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:15,230
have this very nice picture I'm sure you

701
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:18,560
can understand very easily what's

702
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:20,150
happening the nice thing is we have MDS

703
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,950
matrices so you can have bounds on the

704
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,650
number of activist boxes for one round

705
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:26,750
and then if you want if you look at two

706
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:29,240
rounds we have super boxes so we have

707
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,530
five to the square active boxes and then

708
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,290
if you look at eight rounds we have

709
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,670
metal boxes with even more active boxes

710
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:37,279
so everything is very nice

711
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:39,050
of course this picture is a little bit

712
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,380
hard to read because it's a 2d picture

713
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:47,300
but we are the 3d ciphers so that's not

714
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:49,360
optimal so I also have a 3d picture I'm

715
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,680
not sure if you can see it very well

716
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,300
maybe when the slides will be online it

717
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,460
would be easier but yeah this is maybe

718
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,890
the first time we have a 3d picture in

719
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,100
the slides of RAM session conference so

720
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:04,870
thank you

721
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:08,089
[Applause]

722
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:10,549
so Nexus stiffened couple on the Reeboks

723
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:12,620
contest edition - and the foreign

724
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:16,280
speaker is tomorrow on efficiency metric

725
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:18,109
No yeah thank you I would like to bring

726
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,540
the attention to another competition

727
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:22,550
which is the whip box contest so this is

728
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:25,550
the official capture-the-flag for chess

729
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:27,410
2019 so if you're not familiar with the

730
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,280
previous Edition the goal is here you

731
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,899
can be both

732
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,140
design of challenges but also break

733
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:35,900
challenges you can upload C

734
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:38,210
implementation of AES 128 which imbed

735
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,490
the key so you should maybe not put it

736
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,920
just in in the plane and other people

737
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:44,720
can then break these challenges and the

738
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,570
longer your challenge survives the more

739
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:51,049
points you get so these already started

740
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:52,040
last Friday so you can join from now so

741
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:55,220
if you have any ideas

742
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,750
feel free to submit immediately and the

743
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,399
competition will end shortly before

744
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:02,150
chess and whoever gets the most points

745
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:05,090
up to this point will win for those of

746
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:07,220
you are know about the previous contest

747
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,900
we ended a few new rules and changed to

748
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,779
scoring a little bit to make it more

749
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:14,030
exciting so you this time you will also

750
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,440
get bonus points for inverting some

751
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,780
ciphertext so for every challenge

752
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,060
submitted you can request through an API

753
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,520
some cipher texts and if you manage to

754
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:25,310
invert time you will get points and also

755
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:27,430
we will score this time if you provide

756
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:31,100
more efficient white box implementations

757
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:32,750
so if you need less code size if you can

758
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:36,319
compute faster you will get a higher

759
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:38,630
score more quickly so there are already

760
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,610
quite a few people registered so this is

761
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:42,710
a bit outdated so the here it says

762
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:45,140
there's this one competition one

763
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:48,950
challenge which is still open but it got

764
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:50,660
broken last night I think so too late

765
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,129
for you but I'm sure there's gonna be

766
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:55,220
more challenges coming in in the next

767
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,630
days yeah you can find all the

768
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:59,509
information on the contest on this

769
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:02,110
website there will also be a workshop

770
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:05,300
co-located with euro crypt about the

771
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:06,650
white box in general so if you're

772
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,200
attending Europe this might also be

773
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:11,690
interesting for you otherwise I hope a

774
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,149
lot of people will participate and thank

775
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:16,340
you

776
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,340
[Applause]

777
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:24,090
so please all speakers like to remind

778
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,740
you to Advent the slide next one so that

779
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,750
we get the chance to see the Napoli on

780
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,430
picture thank you so this is now

781
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,510
tomorrow on efficient symmetric

782
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,580
primitive for advanced cryptographic

783
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:35,450
protocols marvelous contribution and

784
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,450
next speaker is da Vinci

785
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:52,250
if you don't know me I don't what we

786
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:54,150
call efficient symmetric primitives

787
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:59,490
protocols or just a marvelous

788
00:39:54,150 --> 00:40:03,080
contribution and background for this the

789
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:05,549
foundation organization behind it -

790
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:08,730
cryptocurrency is considering adding

791
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:11,610
zero knowledge mechanism into the engine

792
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:13,770
and this company stock well it's a

793
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:16,200
start-up in israel contacted us in

794
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:20,880
kazakh to help them build a hash

795
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:25,529
function efficient for promoting zero

796
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:28,380
knowledge starts and after a few months

797
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:32,340
of work we came up with the hash

798
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:36,750
function javis so the idea behind Jarvis

799
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:40,920
is that we start from the AES the best

800
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:44,490
sigh fell ever invented which is already

801
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:48,270
quite efficient for Starks but it has a

802
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:49,979
state of sixteen bytes which means that

803
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,290
every operation you platform you need to

804
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:57,960
perform 16 times instead you can walk

805
00:40:52,290 --> 00:41:00,690
with a large state element and enough

806
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,540
fine polynomial after that and then just

807
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,770
the AES just immediately becomes javis

808
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:09,090
because you don't need a shift all the

809
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:11,370
mix columns anymore but um well so we

810
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:12,920
put that online and a few months you

811
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:16,310
weeks later some of our colleagues

812
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:21,300
published an attack against this

813
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:24,180
algorithm so Jarvis was hit now just to

814
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:26,640
say that we actually have some different

815
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,350
we we don't agree we don't necessarily

816
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,839
agree with

817
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:33,230
some visions like every other designer

818
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:36,460
evil molecules will present their attack

819
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:39,860
later today I'm sure he will be super

820
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:43,190
honest about about it I'm no kid in here

821
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:45,920
and we're actually talking about well we

822
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:49,400
disagree but when we found out about

823
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,110
this attack we were already in the

824
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,030
middle of developing something even

825
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:56,840
better than Jarvis and you're the first

826
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:59,690
ones to see that vision vision is

827
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:04,970
similar to javis only that the state is

828
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:07,190
now composed of M state elements M is

829
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:11,180
expected to be a small number like two

830
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:14,540
or three and then you can adjust the

831
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:18,379
size of each element and similar to a

832
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:21,110
yes we don't defend against

833
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:23,510
differentially linear attacks and then

834
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:26,570
you compose an affine layer which is an

835
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:28,430
affine linearized space polynomial that

836
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:31,850
is efficient to compute in zero

837
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:34,040
knowledge and this is around it's

838
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:35,360
composed of two steps so in the first

839
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,250
step we use the inverse of that

840
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,030
polynomial and in the second step we use

841
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:46,880
directly that polynomial and we mix the

842
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:48,800
elements using the MDS matrix so high

843
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:53,560
algebra degree and that's very stark

844
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:56,180
friendly vision works for binary fields

845
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,590
one thing we noticed for job is when you

846
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,839
publish that is that although we

847
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:02,030
stressed everywhere that it only works

848
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,160
for binary fields and it's we don't

849
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:06,830
claim any security for Pine fields

850
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,049
people were sending us emails asking but

851
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:10,940
how do you use it for prime fields so

852
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:13,670
instead of just publishing something

853
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:17,390
that they'll be misusing we decided to

854
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:20,660
also design another cipher in a prime

855
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:23,089
field flavor that's rescue now there are

856
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:26,210
no good fine linearized space

857
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:29,350
polynomials so instead we use a power

858
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:32,390
mapping for the nonlinear part and we

859
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:34,400
alternate between using the power map

860
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:41,430
directly and the inverse of that power

861
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:44,210
map the MDS part works the same and

862
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:47,040
those two designs in addition to being

863
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:49,200
wonderful secure and great also lend

864
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,110
themself pretty well to sponge

865
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,060
constructions because you can have let's

866
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:55,800
say two elements you designate one is

867
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,720
the rate the other is the capacity or

868
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,110
you can have three state elements and

869
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:04,589
then two rate parts and one capacity

870
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:08,960
part or the other way around and that's

871
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:22,080
the team semen the whole Abdul of Manali

872
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:24,480
elephants son and thank you so next

873
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,759
speaker is Lord so classy on how this

874
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,160
design strategy for NPCs Northstars

875
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,890
picnic and the following speaker is a

876
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:35,399
merge of two speakers little fella on

877
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,870
sparkle okay so thanks so they would

878
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,420
like to give a brief presentation about

879
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:43,650
a competitor of the design proposed by

880
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:45,810
itamar and application of these designer

881
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:47,450
many for example security security

882
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,620
Patrick reputation zero-knowledge

883
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:52,080
signature scheme and so on that requires

884
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,190
primitive from symmetric crypto and we

885
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,930
had the performance of this application

886
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,360
depends on the performance of this

887
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:58,890
symmetric crypto in particular the

888
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,410
measure cost is due to do nonlinear

889
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:02,670
operation so what we try to do is to try

890
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:04,830
to reduce the number of Naga new

891
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:07,920
operation a possible way to do this is

892
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:12,450
to move from SPN to pasha SPN but i mean

893
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,470
it's not very nice because some strategy

894
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,990
for example the white race strategy

895
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:18,689
doesn't work for Pasha SPN cipher so you

896
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:20,430
have to think about new new strategies

897
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:23,070
and in general idea they are very

898
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:25,560
complicated so we are quite easy so what

899
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:27,570
we did is just to mix SPN and partial

900
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:30,090
SPN and we obtained the other strategy

901
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:32,340
where some round of who has box failure

902
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:35,160
to meet the round that's just 1s books

903
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:37,110
belong and then we have again round with

904
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,700
focus box KX so in this way we can for

905
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,430
example he use again a white play

906
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,600
strategy

907
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:45,600
so for example these are this means here

908
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:48,120
we are just round with focus box we here

909
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,860
became the S matrix and then again round

910
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,810
with partial s boxing area and round

911
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,880
again with focus box failure and P

912
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:58,580
cipher can be implemented puffin

913
00:45:53,880 --> 00:46:01,140
and in f-22 Dan so I'm not an expert but

914
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:03,420
many people in this group works on

915
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:06,509
applications so just let me give some

916
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:08,610
result about practical application for

917
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:10,950
example what about the signature well

918
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:12,600
using this design we can obtain without

919
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:14,549
that are better than low MC which is

920
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,250
submitted at least for example we can

921
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:20,280
have as much as more a signatu size 700

922
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:23,850
Petrus 1000 and it's much much faster so

923
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:26,100
a factor of 10 for LPC the better the

924
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:31,860
the best schemes for this application

925
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:33,810
are MC and P HN P RF and we can have

926
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:36,030
similar result using this strategy and

927
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:39,630
we also work on stark and sac

928
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:43,890
application so for example we can

929
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:46,020
improve the result that we obtained

930
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:49,680
using the Pattinson ash using a snack

931
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:52,440
and for stack while the competitor we

932
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:56,040
are now a competitor what about Java

933
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,690
stamp ID this is an is a little yes

934
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,509
competitive but it seems that they are

935
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:03,410
broken thanks

936
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:06,270
[Applause]

937
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:08,490
so now are the sparkin permutations

938
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:11,360
pilot of balaam and the next speaker is

939
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:14,910
Stefan Coble again on the third schemes

940
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:17,520
thank you so our quantum superposition

941
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:20,520
collapsed so it's either me or Christoph

942
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:23,520
when it turns out to be me I'm going to

943
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:25,170
talk about briefly our NIST submission

944
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,450
which is called Sparkle so the city of

945
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:29,730
Paris was kind enough to stage a bit of

946
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:31,529
advertisement for us yesterday when you

947
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:35,640
arrive by boat close to the eiffel tower

948
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:38,370
it sparkled to advertise our algorithm

949
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:41,430
which was pretty kind of the city so

950
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:43,410
sparkle is a family a spot of sparks

951
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:46,109
like permutations hence their names so

952
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:48,420
we have on our Xbox think of it like an

953
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,140
alias Super S box that operates on 64

954
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,320
bits using

955
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:54,150
arcs operations and we have a linear

956
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,680
layer which is built like a fighter

957
00:47:54,150 --> 00:48:00,510
network just like in Sparks and this

958
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,310
gives us a nice Espeon structure so

959
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:04,310
although it's arts based it's also much

960
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:07,230
easier to study than other arts based

961
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:07,470
algorithms much like in a scone we have

962
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:09,119
to

963
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:10,799
versions a stream one which we used ring

964
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:15,510
absorptions and a big one which we use

965
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,890
just before squeezing our goal although

966
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:19,050
this is the French symmetric encryption

967
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:21,029
conference I think for historical

968
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,590
reasons this used to be referred to as

969
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:24,090
the fast software encryption conference

970
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:26,970
so we thought it was relevant to

971
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:29,070
introduce it here with these Sparkle

972
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:32,069
permutations we build two families of

973
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:33,810
algorithms hash functions called ash so

974
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:37,440
city in Luxembourg with a nice coat of

975
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:39,540
arm and we use them to build them I'll

976
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:43,770
think T authenticated encryption

977
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:45,720
algorithms using the bitter mode there

978
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:47,550
are there is more information on this

979
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,259
webpage and we also have a mailing list

980
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:51,450
and I'm also very curious to see what

981
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,210
happens if we spend too long on stage so

982
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:56,000
I'm going to wait for a bit

983
00:48:53,210 --> 00:49:00,380
20 seconds that's going to be a hard one

984
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,380
questions do you have any questions oh

985
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:09,840
yeah that's not a very good questions

986
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:11,910
I'd rather have another one that you

987
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,710
were going to have to ask mojito we are

988
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:15,029
not security proof people I can tell you

989
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:18,540
about the design process but

990
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:21,200
unfortunately ok I'm sorry you'll have

991
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:25,320
to take the question alone please

992
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:27,899
so next Turk is Japan Calvo on the third

993
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,700
team effect analysis competition and the

994
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:34,470
foreign speaker is going to be mawkish

995
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:36,390
of nigga on algebraic dots so yeah well

996
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:37,799
previously announced the competition

997
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,720
starting now I'm announcing a

998
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,510
competition ending which is the first

999
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,560
skinny cryptanalysis competition so I

1000
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:46,170
think you already heard a lot about

1001
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:48,630
skinny there were a lot of papers

1002
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:51,150
dealing with it and it's a lightweight

1003
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:54,119
tweakable block cipher received quite a

1004
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:57,089
lot of cryptanalysis and we also had a

1005
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:59,070
skinny competition I think since three

1006
00:49:57,089 --> 00:50:00,420
years every year FSE we announced a

1007
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:03,540
competition and end of the competition

1008
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:04,619
and extended the competition and if

1009
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,940
you're interested in the previous

1010
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:09,450
competition just go to the website

1011
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:11,010
there's a lot of information on it but

1012
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:12,359
for afraid competition we wanted to do

1013
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:14,490
something a little bit different so

1014
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:16,440
before it was always like ok if you

1015
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:18,299
break that many rounds you will get one

1016
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:21,060
present if you break that many rounds

1017
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,300
you get two presents if you break a lot

1018
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,790
of

1019
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,830
you get five presents this time we

1020
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:29,340
wanted to do something a bit more

1021
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:31,590
practical so we provided a set of of

1022
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:34,860
plaintext cipher texts which you could

1023
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:36,720
download on the skinny website and your

1024
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:39,930
goal was to extract the key from this so

1025
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:43,490
it was in both cases we had a skinny 64

1026
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:48,299
and skinny hundred 28 528 bit key and

1027
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:49,859
you should send us the key so this is

1028
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,810
the time line of the competition and

1029
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:53,790
basically everything happens in last

1030
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:55,799
April from the submission point of view

1031
00:50:53,790 --> 00:51:00,840
but a lot of people also worked after it

1032
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:03,330
afterwards so on 4th of April at 12 o

1033
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:05,160
clock exactly 12 o clock so machine e

1034
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:09,750
broke the five rounds version of skinny

1035
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:11,790
64 but then I think just a few hours

1036
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:15,210
later maybe she noticed that she missed

1037
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:19,740
breaking the 4 ounce I'm not sure maybe

1038
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:21,210
she can comment on it and very quickly

1039
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,830
after just one day we got another

1040
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:26,400
contender we started working on the

1041
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:29,430
skinny 128 and then it kind of started a

1042
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,490
little race so catching up on the five

1043
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:36,450
rounds okay we do six rounds okay then I

1044
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:40,890
also do six rounds seven rounds seven

1045
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:42,980
rounds 128 but then finally the skinny

1046
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:45,299
hundred twenty-eight gotta be the head

1047
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:48,930
maybe I don't know if it was around the

1048
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:54,360
Easter and you and they are skinny 64

1049
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:56,129
people we're on holiday then we continue

1050
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:59,670
and you can see the time spent gets a

1051
00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:01,410
bit longer but for skinny hundred 28

1052
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:04,350
nothing happened anymore and the best

1053
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:09,600
result we got was then 12 rounds for

1054
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:12,330
skinny 64 at the end of April so we

1055
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:15,540
would like to announce now who winners

1056
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:20,180
of this which public debate and we are

1057
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:23,040
SHINee levanto broke the skinny 64

1058
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,710
challenge for 12 rounds so I would like

1059
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:28,759
to join them for getting the price and

1060
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,760
all the chemicals

1061
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:39,210
so I hope we go over time although

1062
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:52,750
notary on this time just for explanation

1063
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,090
for those who are not familiar with our

1064
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:58,240
procedure we always severe offers on

1065
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:59,770
skinny from five different countries and

1066
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,689
we always bring prices from everywhere

1067
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:03,640
so we have prices from Japan prices from

1068
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:06,820
Singapore prices from Denmark France

1069
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:15,339
Germany full of nice things for you to

1070
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:17,320
enjoy yeah you still have to stay but

1071
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:23,110
it's a bit of spoiler but you have to

1072
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:25,600
stay and for skinny hundred 388 alexei

1073
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:26,890
medev n KO is the winner he broke ten

1074
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,930
rounds of skinny hundred twenty eight

1075
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:31,779
unfortunately is not here today because

1076
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:33,399
he's preparing for his PhD defense but

1077
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:36,310
nonetheless we would like to thank him

1078
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:45,310
for his participation and his nice

1079
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:47,950
results also if you're interested in for

1080
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:49,840
both these competitions the both offers

1081
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:52,390
provided us a short report explaining

1082
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:54,430
and it's quite interesting and we also

1083
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:59,410
had the competition for the most

1084
00:53:54,430 --> 00:54:01,060
interesting crypt analysis so we would

1085
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:04,480
also like to what the most interesting

1086
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:07,480
crypt analysis to Patrick conflict and

1087
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,800
we actually need lalamon to provide it

1088
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,860
from our point of view the most

1089
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,300
interesting crypt analysis so the

1090
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:15,010
interesting thing was with the challenge

1091
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:17,440
we gave there was some pyres in the

1092
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:19,060
plain texts which was quite interesting

1093
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,890
to see if this makes a difference for

1094
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:23,529
the techs and how you can exploit it and

1095
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:25,930
they showed a very nice truncated

1096
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:28,720
differential attack although it needed

1097
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:30,569
quite a lot of operations so maybe is

1098
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:33,549
not only Bitcoin wasting lot of

1099
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:35,920
computations over the skinny computation

1100
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:37,950
quite used some electricity for your

1101
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,660
university I guess

1102
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:49,600
so please thank them again for their

1103
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:51,549
nice results and we would like to thank

1104
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:55,470
all the participants also the people who

1105
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:58,780
try to break things and didn't succeed

1106
00:54:55,470 --> 00:55:00,459
and if you want to cancel submit results

1107
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:05,290
and we will put them in the website

1108
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:07,300
thank you thank you even though you were

1109
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:09,220
a bit over time so next turkeys

1110
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,950
algebraic crypt analysis of Jovi's and

1111
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:13,930
Friday by mawkish of nigga and the next

1112
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:24,939
speaker is Gaetano again on the shack

1113
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:27,310
seats for oh so it's joint work

1114
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,510
basically first about design so javis is

1115
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:30,970
the block silo Friday is a hash function

1116
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:34,360
using this block cipher both primitives

1117
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:36,189
were proposed by two man's semen in

1118
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,780
recently so last year

1119
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:40,120
their goal is efficiency in stark

1120
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:41,680
setting and some security upwards some

1121
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:45,400
security argument support from the best

1122
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:47,649
cipher out there again so the structure

1123
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,120
is very similar to another side which is

1124
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:51,790
mimsy which you can see on the left side

1125
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:53,680
and the right side shows the job is

1126
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:55,420
round function so basically we have the

1127
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,629
inversion s box and then to a fan

1128
00:55:55,420 --> 00:56:01,570
polynomials of degree 4 and also similar

1129
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:04,510
to the a s 10 to 40 rounds the attacker

1130
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:07,180
is very simple and we exploit two facts

1131
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:09,070
first the both polynomials have a very

1132
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:11,890
low degree so this is good for the grab

1133
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:14,830
no bases and the second fact is that for

1134
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:17,259
all nonzero X we can basically say that

1135
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:20,170
if y equals to the inverse of X then Y

1136
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:23,080
times x equals to 1 which is a db2

1137
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:25,330
function and the procedure is then to

1138
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,610
describe around from both sides and

1139
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:29,890
basically we connect both parts at the

1140
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:32,290
sbox then we compute a Graebner basis

1141
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:35,830
and we try to solve for the unknown

1142
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:37,690
variables which include the keys so the

1143
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:39,250
resulting equation system then includes

1144
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:41,710
intermediate variables for every second

1145
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:44,620
round so this is after another

1146
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:46,000
optimization we've done and we also

1147
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:47,500
exploit the fact that every round case a

1148
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,830
linear function of the master key so we

1149
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:51,730
only need one where for the keys and the

1150
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:54,430
resulting system is

1151
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:57,730
than our half equations of degree 32 in

1152
00:56:54,430 --> 00:57:01,868
our half maribor's and to be secure

1153
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:03,700
against this kind of attack so this are

1154
00:57:01,869 --> 00:57:05,710
just preliminary results and the full

1155
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:09,359
results plus a practical verification

1156
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:11,680
will hopefully be published soon yeah

1157
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:14,670
thanks

1158
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:17,589
[Applause]

1159
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:19,630
and so the final and last talk of this

1160
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:23,440
rap session is the shack seat by gaetano

1161
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:26,050
hall next speaker no one thank you so

1162
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,570
this is a joint work with tomatillo and

1163
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:29,770
just before I begin I would like to make

1164
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,600
some comment about the previous talk

1165
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:34,420
about hash functions I'd like to point

1166
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:38,200
out that md2 md4 md5 are broken by

1167
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:41,200
preimage attack just so the point of

1168
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:42,430
this talk is about sha-1 and yeah

1169
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,939
basically we've been trying to get rid

1170
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:47,879
of shaman for a while now

1171
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:50,770
yeah really we wanted to get out right

1172
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:53,530
so in terms of crypt analysis it's been

1173
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:55,240
broken since 2005 it was the first few

1174
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:56,680
reticle attack it's been improved when

1175
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:59,319
it was implemented in practice quite

1176
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:00,549
recently and yeah basically

1177
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:04,540
cryptographers have spoken

1178
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:06,070
broken means broken sha-1 Musco right so

1179
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:08,290
there's been several attempts at

1180
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:12,280
withdrawal agreements to get rid of

1181
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:14,830
sha-1 so the first one was in 2 5 2006

1182
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:18,280
and list said basically we must switch

1183
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:22,200
to chat to before 2010 yeah that didn't

1184
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:26,550
really work next attempt was in 2011 and

1185
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:29,770
people from CAS on browsers they said

1186
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:31,060
well shaman is sha-256 is not widely

1187
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:32,650
implemented enough so we can still use

1188
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:35,619
someone that really we we should think

1189
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:39,340
about moving out so yeah still not very

1190
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:41,410
strong statement and 2014 we had a real

1191
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:43,830
plan and the idea was that in 2017

1192
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:47,649
someone would should go away from

1193
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:50,470
certificates they considered moving for

1194
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:53,200
deadline earlier but that didn't happen

1195
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:55,868
and then finally in 2017 the beginning

1196
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,759
of the year now all modern browsers

1197
00:58:55,869 --> 00:59:02,220
actually reject shall one certificate so

1198
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:04,369
good right that's done well actually no

1199
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,959
if you look

1200
00:59:04,369 --> 00:59:07,700
what's happening today well showing

1201
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:10,009
certificate still exist you can still

1202
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,839
buy them actually some series will

1203
00:59:10,009 --> 00:59:14,720
happily sell you a shaman certificate

1204
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:17,480
and used in several contexts and

1205
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:20,598
interestingly even though browsers now

1206
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:23,059
reject them if you go to other software

1207
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:26,029
like a mail client like the mail

1208
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:28,819
application in Windows 10 it's perfectly

1209
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:31,279
fine with a shaman certificate and some

1210
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:33,470
servers are still using them like this

1211
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:35,930
server from one of a department of in

1212
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:38,058
the computer science of two dams that

1213
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:39,799
yeah if they have a shaman certificate

1214
00:59:38,059 --> 00:59:41,779
and it's still valid and if you connect

1215
00:59:39,799 --> 00:59:44,059
with my client from Windows 10 you get

1216
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:46,369
no warning and everything goes fine

1217
00:59:44,059 --> 00:59:49,460
so yeah there are still some shaman

1218
00:59:46,369 --> 00:59:51,859
certificates around and it's not just

1219
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:53,630
certificates if you look in TLS for

1220
00:59:51,859 --> 00:59:55,578
instance in the handshake of TLS you

1221
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:57,769
need the hash function and sha-1 is

1222
00:59:55,579 --> 00:59:59,269
still quite widely used there about 5%

1223
00:59:57,769 --> 01:00:05,508
of a website and I have some nice

1224
00:59:59,269 --> 01:00:08,808
examples Springer uses sha-1 has been a

1225
01:00:05,509 --> 01:00:12,319
second one yes here Parliament does UK

1226
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:13,970
also uses a sha-1 for nice example so

1227
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:15,380
yeah so we need to negotiate new

1228
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:17,419
standards but turns out it's quite

1229
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:19,549
complicated when you try to get rid of

1230
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,710
something that used to be very for a

1231
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:23,839
long time and yeah you have a legacy

1232
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:25,489
issues you need a transition period you

1233
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:27,410
need to make a plan you need to

1234
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:30,319
negotiate it you extend the deadline

1235
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:33,859
yeah so yeah nobody knew this would be

1236
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:35,569
so complicated right so I suggest maybe

1237
01:00:33,859 --> 01:00:38,359
we should get some help from people who

1238
01:00:35,569 --> 01:00:41,480
are experts in getting rid of stuff so

1239
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:42,920
like this is a nice time table I think

1240
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:46,309
we should make a similar plan like

1241
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:48,140
several phases from options and it's all

1242
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:51,259
very simple I'm sure we can get rid of

1243
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:53,920
sha-1 with a plan like this I mean yeah

1244
01:00:51,259 --> 01:00:57,349
just just go to the exit right it's easy

1245
01:00:53,920 --> 01:01:01,339
and yeah just keep moving and yeah you

1246
01:00:57,349 --> 01:01:04,599
will go forward right it's not yeah so

1247
01:01:01,339 --> 01:01:06,950
so we came up with a different plan and

1248
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:08,749
basically it seems that users don't care

1249
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:10,700
much about collision attacks I mean yeah

1250
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:12,288
you have collision we have had collision

1251
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,629
attacks on sha-1 for 15 years on this

1252
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:16,369
Silvia so let's try to do something else

1253
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:17,430
let's try to do chosen traffic's

1254
01:01:16,369 --> 01:01:20,490
collisions

1255
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:23,430
and in practice chosen prefix collisions

1256
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:25,410
are much more important you can break a

1257
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:27,058
lot more stuff in practice you can break

1258
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:29,970
certificates you can break the handshake

1259
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:33,210
in TLS so the idea is to follow the md5

1260
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:35,790
model that was applied a few years ago

1261
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:39,990
and there was some really nice work by

1262
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:41,550
Mark Stevens on others doing a children

1263
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:44,250
traffic's collisional is defiant this

1264
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:46,680
really helped kick md5 out so the plan

1265
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:48,900
is to do the same with Chauhan and so we

1266
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:50,520
have the first step in this direction we

1267
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,869
have a nice paper that would be

1268
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,690
presidency that you wrote ripped and we

1269
01:01:51,869 --> 01:01:58,710
have an attack with complexity between 2

1270
01:01:54,690 --> 01:02:00,630
to the 67 and 69 and so we estimate it

1271
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:03,450
will be something like 67 point 3 and

1272
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:06,990
the previous best result was 2 to the 77

1273
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:07,859
so that's the nice improvement so of

1274
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:10,799
course we need some last-minute

1275
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:12,900
negotiation before the actual exit so

1276
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:15,030
there is something good that came out of

1277
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:16,829
the cryptocurrency bubble there are

1278
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:18,630
actually lots of cheap GPUs that you can

1279
01:02:16,829 --> 01:02:21,270
rent now because yeah they're not using

1280
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:23,609
them anymore right it's not not worth it

1281
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:27,000
so you can actually you could actually

1282
01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:29,848
run this computation this to 267

1283
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,309
something it will cost you about 500,000

1284
01:02:29,849 --> 01:02:34,079
euros so that's about the price of a

1285
01:02:32,309 --> 01:02:36,930
one-bedroom apartment in Paris so it's

1286
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,730
not much right or maybe something more

1287
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:42,540
familiar to you it's about the price of

1288
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:44,460
4 brands for PhD students you can choose

1289
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:48,150
four students or one shaman chosen

1290
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:50,069
traffics collision so that's the current

1291
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:51,990
state we're trying to look forward to

1292
01:02:50,069 --> 01:02:54,779
the future relationship with someone so

1293
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:56,399
we have some few extra ideas and we

1294
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:58,500
think we can bring it down a little bit

1295
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:01,170
and it should be below the cost of a

1296
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:05,250
single PhD students and hopefully we

1297
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:12,230
we're trying to implement this soon as

1298
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:14,819
soon as we can thank you sorry no yep

1299
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:18,030
but platitudes on conned I don't in

1300
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:19,590
homes thank you guy down and thanks all

1301
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:24,930
of the speakers of the session again

1302
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:27,430
[Applause]

1303
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:29,649
so please don't go because now we have

1304
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:31,690
the ceremony DP we just need a few

1305
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:32,530
minutes together with base to decide who

1306
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:34,330
gets what

1307
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:36,940
hopefully it won't take more than an

1308
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:40,029
hour and especially if you gave a talk

1309
