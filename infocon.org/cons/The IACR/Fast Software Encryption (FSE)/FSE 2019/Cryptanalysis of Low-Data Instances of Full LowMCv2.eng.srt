00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,170
hello everyone and thanks for

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,660
introduction so in this study I am going

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,150
to talk about Krypton ins of Lu MC for

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,820
some special instances this is the

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,880
outline of the presentation first I

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,240
introduce lu MC and our motivation and

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,669
also the previous works then i will

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,900
present our you know technique and after

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:33,840
that i discuss how the purpose metal can

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:38,579
be utilized to recover the key and

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,920
finally i conclude so as we know for

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,379
most of the applications center ciphers

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,070
like a basic areas are suitable and

15
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,989
efficient

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,910
but for a range of new applications

17
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:54,809
these ciphers are suboptimal acts

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,629
actually in these applications nonlinear

19
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:00,570
operations cost much more than linear

20
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,760
operations for example we can mention

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,450
some applications like multi-party

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,610
computation fully homomorphic encryption

23
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:11,510
zero knowledge proof like snow install

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,330
and very recently some quantum resistant

25
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:17,100
signatures so the main goal of the

26
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,320
primitive which are used in this

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,100
application is to minimize the number of

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:27,419
ants and the multiplications example of

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,429
such designs includes low MCM flip

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:34,740
mimsey and very recently roster which

31
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:40,200
was proposed at last crypto lulu MC was

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:42,539
proposed as a cape 2015 and actually it

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,369
creates a suitable instances for a wide

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:49,189
range of applications for example to

35
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:51,170
submissions in the second round of NIST

36
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:56,259
competition for post quantum

37
00:01:51,170 --> 00:02:00,600
cryptography use Lu MC as

38
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:05,710
they're primitive the run function is

39
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:09,340
SPN but a bit tweaked the designers

40
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,440
chose to use partial nonlinearly here it

41
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,770
means that the nonlinear doesn't apply

42
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:20,380
on the whole state it's only applies on

43
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:22,870
the partial of the state and also the

44
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:26,350
box size is as small as possible

45
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:31,000
it's three BTS box and with algebraic

46
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:34,030
degree 2 and these choses of course can

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,900
make decipher vulnerable against

48
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:40,870
statistical attacks so to provide

49
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,720
reasonable security against statistical

50
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:48,250
statistical crypt analysis designers

51
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:51,490
choose linear layer as invertible binary

52
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:57,850
invertible matrices that are generated

53
00:02:51,490 --> 00:03:08,290
independently and also randomly and end

54
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:11,820
up we also have K addition round keys

55
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:14,579
are generated by another matrices the

56
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:17,260
binary matrices are multiplied to the

57
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:23,410
master key and then subkeys are

58
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:25,720
generated and with respect to the number

59
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:29,709
of rounds the number of rounds provided

60
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,920
by the designers in the in the work they

61
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:35,739
study a lot of techniques and different

62
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,200
crypt analysis and based on the given

63
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:41,020
block size and also allowable data

64
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:44,589
complexity and number of boxes per round

65
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:47,380
where we show by M they have they

66
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:51,130
present formulation for the number of

67
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,140
rounds and they show that if we consider

68
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,560
this amount of rounds then the cipher is

69
00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:01,380
secure against this kind of kept

70
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:05,750
analysis during the process of the

71
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:08,590
designing profit rich and low end

72
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:12,950
propose some update for the

73
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:14,720
formalization formula for computing the

74
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,920
number of rounds to be secure against

75
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,589
boomerang attack and at yield kill 2016

76
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,860
we had another paper on high level

77
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:26,960
differential which led to the second

78
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,590
version of the formula for the number of

79
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,840
rounds and in this work we present new

80
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:36,140
kept analysis for some special instances

81
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:39,349
of AMC which led to the new formula for

82
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:46,210
the number of grouse and it's important

83
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:49,280
to note that Lu MC version 3 is actually

84
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:53,030
utilized in different schemes for

85
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,450
example signature scheme picnic or some

86
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:59,809
groups in nature scheme proposed by Dan

87
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:04,330
Boone and others they use low MC so it's

88
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:07,210
widely used in different applications

89
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:10,849
our work is inspired by previous

90
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:14,570
techniques so let me remind the basic

91
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:16,210
idea from the previous works rapidly

92
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,650
meet-in-the-middle

93
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,900
capital model is a well-known kept

94
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,479
analysis that at least in the basic

95
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:28,989
scenario it requires a very limited

96
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:32,180
number of data and also actually it only

97
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:35,540
it's independent of the inner components

98
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:39,110
it's somehow it's a structural attack

99
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:43,760
however it's not applicable on cipher

100
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:46,430
like Lu MC because the kill schedule is

101
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,659
strong enough and the sub key around

102
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,800
kids are generated based on the whole G

103
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,020
another attack is differential

104
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,590
cryptanalysis a flexible difference is a

105
00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:00,940
different is a flexible method that can

106
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:04,369
be applied on a variety of ciphers but

107
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,070
designers of Lu MC they provide a lower

108
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,410
bound

109
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,210
or the active boxes and then

110
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,870
differential cryptanalysis is not

111
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,750
applicable on the cypher another idea

112
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:19,950
which was proposed by Timothy and sylco

113
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,930
in 2009 to apply an alias was the kind

114
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,520
of combination of truncated differential

115
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,770
method and meet-in-the-middle

116
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,669
method internal kata differential

117
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:32,760
instead of looking just one input pay

118
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,380
and output difference input difference

119
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,420
and outward difference we can see the

120
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,960
set of input differences and set of our

121
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:44,700
two differences however they combine

122
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:47,969
these ideas to somehow make you take

123
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:51,690
advantage of the positive properties of

124
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:54,660
both attacks however the application of

125
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,940
this kind of method is challenging and

126
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,910
OMC because the linear layer of names is

127
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:03,150
very strong it's a bit oriented matrix

128
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,790
and if not find really an efficient

129
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:08,849
truncated differential characters is for

130
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,460
few runs of the cipher so what we aim to

131
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:16,260
doing this work is to somehow exploit

132
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:19,320
these well-known techniques to take

133
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,810
advantage of positive properties and

134
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,530
then overcome the limitations such that

135
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:27,960
it can be applicable on low MC so let me

136
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,599
first give an overview of the technique

137
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:35,750
of our technique we divide the cipher

138
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:38,610
into three parts namely r1 r2 and r3 and

139
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,920
for the first part of the cipher we aim

140
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:45,450
to find the differential characteristics

141
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:49,620
with input Delta in such that this

142
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:51,450
cartel six holes with property 1 so if

143
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,920
we have a deterministic differential

144
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,200
characteristics the idea is that

145
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,860
independent of the value of the unknown

146
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:04,469
key we can predict the difference at the

147
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:07,260
output of the one round then we ask the

148
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,660
Oracle to provide us corresponding

149
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,340
ciphertext of the plaintext P and P

150
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,640
prime such that the difference between P

151
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,349
and P prime is Delphi for the second and

152
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,110
third part of the cipher instead of

153
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,360
looking for

154
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,850
or differential or through ContentID

155
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,780
differential carries characteristic with

156
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,770
high probability

157
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:28,989
we aim to find all of the reachable

158
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,669
output differences after our two rounds

159
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,210
so we compute all of them reachable

160
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:38,289
after all of the reachable differences

161
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:41,170
here from Delta r1 and we saved all of

162
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:42,640
the immunise in our list and we do the

163
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,160
same for the third power from the

164
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,699
ciphertext and for the backward

165
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,189
direction and we compute all of the

166
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,820
reachable differences from here to here

167
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:57,610
and in the meeting the middle approach

168
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:00,220
we can find we can compare two cells and

169
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,980
find the common values in both sets and

170
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,350
if this value is unique then it means

171
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,880
them they could find the value of the

172
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,360
difference in the middle of the cipher

173
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,180
independent of the unknown key and of

174
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,720
course and of course if it's unique

175
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:19,620
value then we can do the same thing for

176
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,060
other rounds and obtain all of the

177
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:27,160
differences internal differences of the

178
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:29,939
cipher so let's go to the details for

179
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,709
the first part to have deterministic

180
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,900
differential characteristic we needs we

181
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:41,200
need to have all of these boxes be

182
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:44,199
passive so each each round has M s boxes

183
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,450
each s box has three bits so our our

184
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,450
rounds we have three multiplied M

185
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,790
multiplied our filtration so if we

186
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,920
consider the length of the Lu MCP then

187
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,140
we expect to have to do the B minus 3

188
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,270
and our deterministic differential

189
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,949
characteristics so to have to tell

190
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:03,699
communistic differential characteristics

191
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:08,380
it's enough to consider all one has B

192
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:12,280
over 3 and approximately for the second

193
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,950
and third part of the method we need to

194
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:19,030
somehow estimate the number of reachable

195
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:21,670
differences we compute the sum how

196
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:24,069
exactly reachable

197
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,589
differences in our paper more precisely

198
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,980
but here

199
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:30,760
[Music]

200
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:34,060
I prefer to not to go to the details but

201
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,430
just given all of you so if we consider

202
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,439
only one s parks and we fix the

203
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,229
difference turned out the difference of

204
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:45,610
this box of new MC can get at most to

205
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:48,520
the two different values and if we

206
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,560
consider our ones of the surface with

207
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:55,449
the assumption all of the S boxes or

208
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,670
active then each round has MS boxes so

209
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,950
if we consider all rounds then totally

210
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,740
we have mr s boxes so totally we have

211
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:07,180
two to the two multiply M multiplied are

212
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:10,780
different values at most so they come

213
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:14,199
the time complexity for computing all of

214
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:17,589
the reachable differences and creating

215
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:20,350
the list is to the to M or two for the

216
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,970
second power and for the third Pole and

217
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,440
of course it should be less than to the

218
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,680
decay because we want to have a cute

219
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,250
analysis faster than exhaustive search

220
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:33,219
another limitation is to avoid run

221
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,990
collision to avoid run collision the

222
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:39,000
number of rounds in the second and third

223
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:42,670
part should be less than this value and

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,460
so of course we cannot manage this

225
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,469
inequality because it's a time

226
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,440
complexity and we want to have a faster

227
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,840
attack than exhaustive search but the

228
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,730
question is how we can manage this

229
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,370
inequality how we can solve this problem

230
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,500
because if we have more than one

231
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:02,380
collision in the middle of the cipher

232
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,830
then is somehow challenged the idea is

233
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:08,910
simple yet very effective we move from

234
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:11,110
the French short pulley topic

235
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:15,670
characteristic which was for the first

236
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:18,400
time purpose by TSN at York you 2014

237
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:20,469
instead of considering one difference

238
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,480
and the probable they put up allegation

239
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,270
of one difference we consider T

240
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,170
differences and couple of P differences

241
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:31,540
and similarly we can also estimate the

242
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,490
number of the differences available and

243
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,640
reachable in the middle of the cipher so

244
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,290
for one spots we have at most two 1s box

245
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,430
of blue MC we have at most two to the

246
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,670
three

247
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:45,640
different values at the output of the S

248
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:50,430
box and if we consider our rounds each

249
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:53,650
round has MS boxes so totally we have Mr

250
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,810
activist boxes in the worst case so at

251
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:58,000
most we have to do three multiply M

252
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:02,890
multiplied our different values for T

253
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,320
differences and now to avoid any running

254
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,810
collision is enough to consider the

255
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,960
dimension D large and at this value so

256
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:13,209
we can simply manage this by actually

257
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,430
increasing the dimension of the

258
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:20,200
differences so far we have discussed

259
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:24,670
finding obtaining internal differences

260
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:27,670
of the hour the sulfur without computing

261
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:30,099
the key now it's important to understand

262
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,829
how it affects the security of the

263
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,530
cipher we want to know if we know the

264
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,560
internal differences in the middle of

265
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:41,430
the cipher can will it leave the key

266
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:45,040
actually efficiently how we can compute

267
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:48,099
obtain the key efficiently so let me

268
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,599
remind the renowned definition for s

269
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:55,540
boxes we call an S box Delta uniform if

270
00:13:52,600 --> 00:14:01,270
for a specific input difference alpha

271
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:03,819
and another specific output difference

272
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:06,970
better for all of Alpha and Beta

273
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:09,520
valuable the number of X that satisfied

274
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:15,670
in this equation would be less or equal

275
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:19,090
to Delta if for example for Lu MC Liu MC

276
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:23,319
s box is to you is two to the two for

277
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:27,850
uniform and so in general if the S box

278
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:30,250
is 2x uniform and if we assume that in

279
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,770
the last rounds all of the MS boxes are

280
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:35,650
active then we have two to the N X

281
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:38,020
different solutions for a given input

282
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:41,800
differences and output differences of

283
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:43,720
the last round and each of them each of

284
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,439
this solution

285
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:51,070
leads to a specific value for the state

286
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,520
before the spot and after the sbox and

287
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:56,680
each of them can lead to a unique sake

288
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,350
and of course if we use more pairs then

289
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,630
we can retrieve the last round of the

290
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,450
key but the key point here is that we

291
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:07,090
cannot retrieve the whole sub key at the

292
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:10,570
at the end of the cypher because the

293
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:13,240
part of the anomaly layer is partial so

294
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:17,680
to be able to continue this way for

295
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,290
other sub keys we need to present this

296
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,920
equivalent representation of a year of

297
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:25,870
UMC so this is the structure of blue MC

298
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,479
and if you look at the last two

299
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,870
operations both of them are linear so we

300
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,850
can simply swap them and consider

301
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:36,220
equivalent sub key instead of original

302
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,140
Saatchi and again if you look at this

303
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,680
key addition and this key addition as

304
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,240
the nonlinear layer is partial then we

305
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,300
can combine this part and this part

306
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,110
together just like this and then again

307
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:52,390
we can see their equivalents are key for

308
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:54,010
round before the last round and of

309
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,240
course we can continue this way and

310
00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:00,010
finally we have this kind of

311
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:03,100
presentation representation for low MC

312
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:07,060
so if I can retrieve this value of the

313
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:10,090
for the last round of the cypher then we

314
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:12,880
can simply decree 1 1 and again apply

315
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:17,370
the metal to retrieve the sub here for

316
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:21,340
other ones these are the results of the

317
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:25,150
attack for example if you look at this

318
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:28,540
instance the equivalent is 256 the

319
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:31,270
number of grams is 158 the allowable

320
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:33,969
data is 16 and number of s-boxes 1 and

321
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:37,449
block size is 120 and the time

322
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:43,270
complexity of the attack is 2 to the 165

323
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:49,390
atmos which is not only faster than 2 to

324
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:51,850
the 256 the key point here is that if in

325
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,889
our formulation we have found that if

326
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,649
the

327
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:58,249
size is larger than the key size then

328
00:16:55,649 --> 00:17:00,689
it's better to use conventional

329
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:03,179
differential characteristics it means

330
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:04,879
that the differences with dimension t1

331
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:08,309
like conventional difference

332
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,519
differential and when the block size and

333
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:13,769
key sizes are equal or equal then the

334
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,419
dimension 2 is the best choice and of

335
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:18,809
course when the block size is much

336
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:20,929
smaller than the key size then we can

337
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:23,779
increase the dimension of the

338
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:28,620
differences for example we consider the

339
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:31,889
4 and then we can avoid any run

340
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:36,600
collision in the middle of the cipher so

341
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:40,250
all of the instances we could attack

342
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,199
they have the same structure same

343
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,860
property that the number of s boxes in

344
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,740
internal is very limited for example

345
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:52,139
15.5 so it's only applicable on low data

346
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,960
instances and also that allowable data

347
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:58,320
is also very limited so it's only

348
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,429
applicable on low data instances of low

349
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,830
MC but it's a very important family

350
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:08,340
class of Lu MC family of cipher because

351
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:12,120
it's already used in some signature

352
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:16,049
post-mortems in natures and so it's a

353
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:20,100
very important class of Lu MC so to

354
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:22,408
conclude we present we propose a new

355
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,360
presentation representation for the

356
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:27,049
block cipher with partial non limit may

357
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:30,178
yet the presentation that we I just

358
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:33,470
introduced it can be applicable on any

359
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:36,870
ciphers be inserted with non partial

360
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:39,750
nonlinear layer and we provide a new

361
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:41,699
insight into the security evaluation of

362
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,760
whimsy and also block suffer with

363
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,830
partial and immediate layer and our

364
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,860
results are the best results for

365
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:52,220
salvation of life see that led to a new

366
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,219
round

367
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:15,610
Christian any question so have you tried

368
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:19,720
these techniques on other partial Espeon

369
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:22,360
ciphers yeah so for example if you can

370
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:26,500
see the zero then it's also applicable

371
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,689
on zero or other ciphers but in compared

372
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,870
to other software are there catalysis of

373
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:36,300
zorro our results are not better but the

374
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:40,270
point is that our attack can be

375
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:43,360
applicable on Zoro and independent of

376
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:45,070
the linear layer so if we change the

377
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,350
linear layer of course differential and

378
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:50,800
linear attack and not be applied or at

379
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:53,949
least it can be challenging to apply on

380
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:57,580
zero or similar ciphers but all the work

381
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:59,650
is independent of the linear layer and

382
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:07,270
inner properties properties of the

383
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:16,250
cipher but yeah it's not ok thank you

384
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:19,019
naturally okay thank you thank you

385
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,019
