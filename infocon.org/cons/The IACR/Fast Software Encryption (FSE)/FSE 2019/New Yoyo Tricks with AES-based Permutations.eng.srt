1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:06,060
so hello back everyone

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,068
this is novelist's session of today

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,399
before the REM session and this session

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,530
is about new exciting results on the AES

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,410
new cryptanalytic results so the first

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,250
paper is called new yoyo tricks with AES

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,080
based permutation by demons are

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:26,130
moustaches are Hammond on Gutenberg and

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,769
mr. Fischer will give the dog chance for

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,419
the introduction what I had to page in

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,000
today is a joint work with diamond saw

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,090
and goes on pal it's new your tricks

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,380
with a is based permutations and in this

14
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,300
work we have tried to device

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,790
distinguishes first a is best

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,129
transferable permutations for this

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,230
purpose we have chosen to a is best

18
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:51,269
reputation AAS in the known key setting

19
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:52,620
and a is best permutation ask these are

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,199
typical distinguishing setting where a

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,570
distinguished arty tries to distinguish

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,750
between random uniform random

23
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:05,099
permutation and given permutation so our

24
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,659
distinguished will work in the adaptive

25
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,298
chosen plaintext and cipher test sitting

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,909
and attacks will look similar quite

27
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,119
similar to the boomerang attacks there

28
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,070
the plaintiffs there we will give some

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:22,460
difference to the plaintext and we'll

30
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:25,080
get in the return pair some defense so

31
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,649
these are we choose the to plain text

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,298
with some defense alpha there there are

33
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,280
some special ways to choose the Alpha

34
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,950
which we will discuss later and in the

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,470
slides and we used round radius ciphers

36
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,840
to encrypt then and get new pair of text

37
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:46,408
c1 c2 with given with defense beta and

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,600
now we use the function s M soif on c1

39
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,240
and c2 to obtain new pair of ciphertext

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,520
C 1 des and C 2 days and the relation

41
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,589
between c1 and c2 s is that c1 des in

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,130
the defense of c1 and c2 des is equal to

43
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,320
the defense of c1 and c2 and we and this

44
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,658
UN and s and C 2 days are decrypted

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,648
using the round energy Stefan and new

46
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,690
pair of plaintext are obtained now we

47
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,459
look into the matter where actually this

48
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,720
work is done by Andre rajim at all in

49
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,060
2017

50
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,710
and this showed that there is a special

51
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,380
relation between this alpha and Delta

52
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:23,850
and there is they they found out that

53
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:27,210
the the zero difference pattern between

54
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:31,260
alpha and the Delta is equal for two

55
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:33,000
jennxpenn rounds so for the round

56
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,440
reduced ciphers they used it to to

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,110
Jenica spin-offs and this showed this

58
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,170
result that for two JSP announced the

59
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,270
new defense pattern of the P 1 and P 2

60
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:46,920
is equal to the difference pattern of P

61
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:49,890
R and s and P 2 - these are and they

62
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,929
generalize this work and use this result

63
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,619
to find the first key independent your

64
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,450
distinguisher of AES and also they they

65
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,560
implemented this error to find the five

66
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,600
round key recovery attack so how does

67
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,490
the aims walk walk we have defined two

68
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,440
things there the aims of function and

69
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,560
the Geo defense pattern aims of work

70
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,430
there's the typical AES superest walks

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,430
so

72
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:29,910
so in the upper part of the superest box

73
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:32,400
these the diagonals and the diagonals of

74
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:35,579
that super as books parts so if we want

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,830
to implement that implement the sub

76
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,600
function on the upper parts so what we

77
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,720
will do we will swap according to the

78
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,000
diagonals so there are four diagonals

79
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,500
and in total there are fourteen

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,500
combinations of the swapping functions

81
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,480
and if we want to swap according to the

82
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,030
in the last layer of the superest box

83
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,280
will swap according to the inverse

84
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,190
diagonals and here also there are 14

85
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,530
combinations abner of the swap functions

86
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,390
and these the example of the swap how

87
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,240
the swap was there are two aes states

88
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,559
and after the swap these only one

89
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,840
diagnosis were swap between them and

90
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,450
this the new states became these are the

91
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,850
swap function works and the giro

92
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,488
difference pattern is we just draw two

93
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,858
plain text and see whether some of the

94
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:22,078
superest boxes are active or not if the

95
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:25,020
service was easy active we do not eat y0

96
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,290
and otherwise it is one so prepared for

97
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,349
this particular case the zeb becomes 0 1

98
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,840
1 1 1 and the weight is a weight is the

99
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:39,479
number of inactive superest boxes in the

100
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:41,280
in the difference so the the UM your

101
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,659
game basically works with choosing new

102
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,909
pairs on plane airplane takes and

103
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,310
ciphertext and these are made adaptively

104
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,770
and when making this new pairs of texts

105
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,229
a certain property gift in invariant and

106
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,690
at the end of the game which we see that

107
00:04:52,229 --> 00:05:00,539
whether we verify that whether the that

108
00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:02,219
property is satisfied or not so this

109
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,650
work is basically done by Chandra no

110
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:08,729
matter we we exploited their work and

111
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:11,909
further extended the results so our

112
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:14,370
target is here ask-ask permutation which

113
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:18,180
is based permutation and the AES in the

114
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,669
non key setting this is the ask

115
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,650
permutation to round there you can say

116
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:24,479
there there are 4 es States each of

117
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,849
these tests goes through two rounds of

118
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,210
AES rounds and after that there is a

119
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,710
permutation and in the original ask

120
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:35,060
these steps are repeated 10 times so

121
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,060
there are 20 rounds in total

122
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:41,490
and to penetrate to implement the

123
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,310
insolence design is less work of the

124
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:47,639
yo-yo game we have to first identify the

125
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:50,909
superest boxes or some other nonlinear

126
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,680
nonlinear construction in these results

127
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:54,419
in this works so first we have

128
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,939
identified the superest box in the ass

129
00:05:54,419 --> 00:06:00,870
we can see that this is the similar to

130
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:04,530
the AES superest box and there are 16

131
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:07,409
superest boxes in this result so now we

132
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:11,128
can use the SLS yogam on the is less

133
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:14,039
work in this result directly and these

134
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:15,659
the makings most of a is asked which was

135
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,509
given by the design as themselves it

136
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:20,580
covers three point five rounds and the

137
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:23,460
superest was also starts from the even

138
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,099
rounds like and and the mega X was also

139
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:31,198
starts from the even round and in the

140
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:34,740
last count the mix column is omitted now

141
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,409
there the first result which is the

142
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,589
direct implementation of the yo-yo

143
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:42,629
result so first with the four in the

144
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:45,569
four mega is boxes it starts from the

145
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:47,430
round two so there are three point five

146
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:50,190
rounds the mixcolumns

147
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,779
completes the fourth round and after

148
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,879
that against the three point five rounds

149
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,889
Omega X boxes so in total there are

150
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,509
eight rounds and it starts from the

151
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:00,659
event now that is that's why it is the

152
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:03,180
two two two nine two two nine and in

153
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:09,180
this we can directly implement the

154
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:12,389
result of the yo-yo paper so for

155
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,189
extending those results which are which

156
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:17,909
are already implemented in you again we

157
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:21,629
look into the into the into the further

158
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:25,500
into the Super S boxes itself so like

159
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:27,330
far like previous where only the

160
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,210
superest boxes are denoted whether they

161
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,639
are active or inactive we further look

162
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,830
into the super cassettes and denote that

163
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,199
whether each of the bytes in the super

164
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,000
expose are active or not active so for

165
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,319
the first of Super S box it's all whites

166
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,990
are active so so nu square alpha 0 is 0

167
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,599
and see the last Super S box that is

168
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,410
alpha 3 only one white is active so they

169
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:55,530
are the so

170
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:57,690
its value is 0 1 1 1 so our first

171
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:01,590
strategy to extend the yoga Mitch

172
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:03,710
prepend happen strategy so what we have

173
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:06,590
done this is the classical euro game and

174
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:09,390
this entry domestic distinguisher and

175
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:13,560
because new or beta goes to new of ETA

176
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:16,440
with probability 1 now to a prepend we

177
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,390
have added one round to it which have

178
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:23,219
some round prepend someone will probably

179
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:25,430
stick with probability P and and same

180
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,070
rounds are added at the end of the game

181
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:31,650
with probabilities with some probability

182
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,479
so alpha to Delta and now will not be a

183
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:38,760
deterministic distinguisher it will come

184
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:40,919
with some probability and we have

185
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,870
implemented this for the we have

186
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,120
implemented this for the oz9 round is

187
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,940
starting from round one so what we have

188
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,180
down what we have down here we have two

189
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:55,370
for the first part we have chosen for

190
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:58,709
where activate only one superest box and

191
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:01,530
there are only four bytes and after the

192
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,870
one round because there are the shift

193
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:07,770
rows and mix column with poverty to the

194
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:09,570
minus 22 it will become 4 to 4 to 1

195
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,790
property will come and only one super

196
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:15,480
response will be only one byte will be

197
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:18,300
active in in beta that means on one mega

198
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,180
has was get active in beta so in ETA and

199
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,939
it there will be one mega is both active

200
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,609
and that means there are 16 bytes in

201
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,790
each mega xbox one with some probability

202
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:32,070
one of the spies will get and in act

203
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:36,800
will be inactive in ETA and which in

204
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:40,290
turn in Delta make four bytes in active

205
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,660
this is a example of this result there

206
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:45,180
are 4 bytes which are we in alpha which

207
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,670
are active after 4 - after our first

208
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,280
round those due to the property of mix

209
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,920
column the one byte gets active with 42

210
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,439
to the minus 22 and due to the euro game

211
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,010
there are 16 the one mega is most active

212
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,230
here and with some probability we get

213
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,550
one byte in active in the active may

214
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,950
Xbox which in turn

215
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:13,089
in the Delta gives us for bite free

216
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:15,430
bites so next our strategy is composing

217
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,880
impossible differential with the yo-yo

218
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:21,069
game for this we have used the you know

219
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,680
we have used the inverted u like the

220
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,690
previous yo-yo we can play the yoga mean

221
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:32,020
both direction here we will use the

222
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:35,140
inverted one so in this we have first

223
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:38,410
used the inverted u opium and then we

224
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,870
have append linear layer and after that

225
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,880
we have a tendon is offended ah is des

226
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:46,420
layer here is desk in be a sub purse

227
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:50,410
were is box super as box or mega exposed

228
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:53,740
anything it can be and after that we get

229
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:58,990
beta and we try to impose impossibility

230
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:00,760
condition of beta based on alpha and we

231
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,530
have applied this result on we have

232
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,720
applied this result to found the six

233
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,730
round a yes in distinguisher and asked

234
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,630
distinguisher four nine ten and twelve

235
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:12,220
rounds this is the impossible

236
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:15,760
differential for six round AES

237
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:19,240
so here the SLS in the SLS constraint s

238
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:23,710
means on supers box so SLS compose the

239
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:25,810
3.5 rounds in the left side so 3.5

240
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,510
rounds and ale means the head the mix

241
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,479
column and after then again 1.5 rounds

242
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:34,810
in total it makes six rounds without the

243
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:37,960
last mix column so it starts in alpha

244
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:40,089
we'd make one superest was active so in

245
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,880
gamma there will be one superest was

246
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:45,430
active so that means that in each column

247
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,230
there are one byte active at least and

248
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,449
one there will be one byte active

249
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,520
so after mix column all the four bytes

250
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,500
will get active in the in one column

251
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,760
which in turn will activate all the

252
00:11:53,500 --> 00:12:00,370
supers boxes so in Delta in for the AES

253
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,950
case will have never the never the case

254
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,870
that will get in active superest box

255
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,270
this is the impossibility condition and

256
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:13,240
this is how the as6 round distinguisher

257
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:15,610
is devised for ask the same thing is

258
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,550
done we have used the previous editor

259
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,730
asked

260
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:22,849
and after appending the linear layer

261
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:25,250
that is the MMC megamix column layer for

262
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:29,540
in-ground we have offended as simply the

263
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:32,300
S box to extend one round for the 11th

264
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:35,209
round we have a extend we have appended

265
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,760
the superest boxes to extend two rounds

266
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:40,340
and for the 13 rounds we have appended

267
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,410
makes boxes to have to extend four more

268
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:46,360
rounds and these are all the same

269
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,360
conditions like impossibility conditions

270
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,280
now the last one that is the bad

271
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:55,400
external euro came here we have used to

272
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:58,579
yo-yo game and those are those are added

273
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,860
by the linear layer so this is the first

274
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,050
you inverted yogam and then we have

275
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,240
offended a linear layer and after that

276
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:09,290
we have used another in another yogam

277
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,270
now we start from alpha we took we start

278
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:14,000
from alpha get the Delta and try to

279
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:19,490
impose impossible condition on Delta

280
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,250
based on alpha 4 we have ich to use the

281
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,780
strategy to find the first we have used

282
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:28,220
the strategy find distinguisher for

283
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:30,650
eight round AES and 16 down ask so these

284
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,380
are distinguishes so what I mean here in

285
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:37,610
the AES case again we start with one

286
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:40,250
superest was active and in in alpha in

287
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,430
ETA we get one superest was active so

288
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,980
there will be one one active bytes in

289
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,540
each column so after mix column all the

290
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,160
four whites will be active in each

291
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,530
column which in turn makes all the

292
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,770
superest boxes active so in Delta all

293
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:57,920
the superest box will be active for the

294
00:13:54,770 --> 00:14:01,880
AES so in a will never have the will

295
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,459
never get inactive Super's box in the

296
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,410
ask case we want to get we are using

297
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,260
instead of super his bosses we are using

298
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:12,410
mega X boxes so in alpha we are

299
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:15,260
activating one only one mega Xbox which

300
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,150
in turn you know in ETA will activate

301
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:20,000
only one mega is first due to the yoyo

302
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:22,550
game so in Delta due to the mix column

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,060
all the four bytes of a column will be

304
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:28,969
active so this activates all the form ax

305
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,199
boxes so in Delta all the Maya four mega

306
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,600
X versus will be active

307
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,160
and these the impossible the impossible

308
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,380
condition is that in Delta will never

309
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,380
have a inactive mega Xbox

310
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,230
these are the distinguishes on us and

311
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,510
our work report the first nine noun

312
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:50,810
distinguish a studying from round one we

313
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:53,480
have also reported the eighth round its

314
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:55,459
and deterministic distinguishes and all

315
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:00,769
others our all other distinguishes using

316
00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:02,619
a negligible memory very these are the

317
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:06,260
eighth round Naoki distinguishes and

318
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:10,360
again due to the by decks in your game

319
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:12,589
we are using very negligible memory and

320
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,240
these are the distinguish which are

321
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:16,399
reported in this work in total we have

322
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,399
we have reported eight distinguishes of

323
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,740
way success related to ask and toward

324
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,149
related to AES and all of the

325
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:28,639
distinguishes are using Englishman

326
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:31,040
memory so we have so new ways to

327
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,769
exchange the Euro game we have compost

328
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,240
classical differentials and impossible

329
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,519
differentials with the euro game and

330
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,550
also we have compost to your games to

331
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,500
sort the by adaxel yogam and our our

332
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,410
technique can be used for the public

333
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,180
computations and using this techniques

334
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,670
we have so far achieve the best results

335
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,640
were asked and we have also so known a

336
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,870
new non key distinguisher for AES and

337
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,519
all the practical distinguishes that

338
00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:06,350
have been reported however have been

339
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:14,209
practically verified thank you so we

340
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:18,819
have time for some questions okay I have

341
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:21,349
a question so when you look at a yes q

342
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:23,300
do you think you could improve its

343
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,640
security by modifying the mixing layer

344
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,380
where you for while you're mixing in

345
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,939
between the AES rounds is it a weakness

346
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:33,709
which you exploit in your attack or is

347
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:36,430
it optimal I mean could you make a esq

348
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:38,899
stronger by changing this mixing layer

349
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:43,189
now we have not looked into that till

350
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:48,530
now okay okay

351
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:48,530
thank you let's find a speaker go

352
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,890
[Applause]
