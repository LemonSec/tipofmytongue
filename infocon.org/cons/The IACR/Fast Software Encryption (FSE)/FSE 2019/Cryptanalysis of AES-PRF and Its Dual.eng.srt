00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,869
the next attack is crypt analysis of AES

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,960
pif and zero

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:15,719
the authors are Patrick

Pepe de su y Berta Lincoln Suisun y todo

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,770
how young one meeting one and Ling will

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,770
give the attack

7
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,919
thanks for the introduction the name of

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:54,170
the presentation is crypt analyzed of

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:56,930
AES PRF and is do so we will start with

10
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:59,510
a background and motivation following

11
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,300
that we will give some really related

12
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:06,979
preliminaries and then we will present

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:10,220
the overview of our attack then we will

14
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:13,820
look into the attacks on AES PRF and do

15
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:19,820
a SPF at last we will give the summary

16
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:22,190
and conclusion as we all know steady

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,970
random permutation is Val main

18
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:29,090
primitives in symmetric key cryptography

19
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:32,810
to realize some security functionalities

20
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:36,080
such as encryption and authentication it

21
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:39,080
is also the ultimate security goal in

22
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,440
the design of block ciphers many block

23
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:45,470
ciphers withstanding extensive analyzed

24
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:51,130
are regarded as the random permutation

25
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:54,220
for example AES in some modes of

26
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,958
operation the invertibility is

27
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:00,170
unnecessary and the security will

28
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,830
improve if said random permutation is

29
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:06,470
replaced with a set of random function

30
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:08,619
for example in the city our encryption

31
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:13,430
mode and the authenticated encryption

32
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:16,010
GCM fala secures the random function we

33
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:20,660
infer the security beyond the first a

34
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:22,579
pound giving some candidate block

35
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,489
ciphers there are several techniques

36
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,650
enable us to transform said random

37
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:30,800
permutation to set a random function

38
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:34,880
however all these techniques in guilt

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:39,590
endure considerable efficiency cost so

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:42,760
to maintain the efficiency based on the

41
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:46,910
two of encrypted Davis mayor structure

42
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:50,929
many minikin navies propose the delicate

43
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:55,970
design code as fast as fast appear a fat

44
00:02:50,930 --> 00:03:05,540
has he given an iterative block cipher

45
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:11,180
it a very donate donate the first part

46
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:14,439
of the output of of PRF equals ax of

47
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,439
these two values

48
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:22,640
AES PRF is as efficiency as a yes

49
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:27,018
however the efficiency comes as the cost

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:30,440
of true or both security the the

51
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:33,889
proposed accurate results of EDM D

52
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,769
requires the the components to be

53
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:40,599
independent permutations which is no

54
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:44,269
longer applies to a ESP F so we want to

55
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:47,929
reconsider the security of a ESP F in

56
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:48,879
our work we mainly focus on these open

57
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,819
problems

58
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:56,239
firstly in the previous FST paper s

59
00:03:52,819 --> 00:04:00,410
equals to is left as an open open

60
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,269
problem and we handle it with impossible

61
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,220
differential and Darrow correlation

62
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:10,010
attack besides which considers the

63
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:12,319
security of many other variants we also

64
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:16,519
consider the security of the doer

65
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:19,219
version which we called UAE SPF the

66
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,380
method used in this paper include

67
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,810
impossible differential there a

68
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,800
correlation traditional differential

69
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:30,349
kryptonite's

70
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:34,669
and meeting the middle attack so this is

71
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:37,639
the structure of a ESP RF the whole the

72
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:40,969
full the full encryption state the full

73
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:44,240
encryption of AES is divided into the

74
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:48,199
first ezrin's and the last theorem the

75
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:51,260
output of a ESP are because the state

76
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:55,849
encrypted by the first astronaut and the

77
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:58,310
state encrypted by as passed here and we

78
00:04:55,849 --> 00:05:00,789
also considered the security of the

79
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:04,780
counterpart of a

80
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:07,840
the full encryption is also divided into

81
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:13,210
two part but the plan taxes use as a

82
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:16,510
feed-forward clearly in this to

83
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:19,750
structure when when asked all T equals

84
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:22,719
to zero they are insecure so in the

85
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:26,260
following discussion we only focus on

86
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:31,090
the cases where as auntie Aoi calls are

87
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:33,909
all greater than zero before we look

88
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:47,830
into the concrete attack they give the

89
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:49,870
overview for the attacks on a SPF we you

90
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,550
will see they use the impossible

91
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,710
differential and their correlation

92
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,860
measure to launch the key recovery

93
00:05:53,710 --> 00:06:00,250
attack the none of the vision is the

94
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,850
second part is a permutation so that we

95
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,890
can construct trivia impossible

96
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:09,660
differential or trivial zero correlation

97
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:12,520
linear approximation for the second part

98
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:17,320
in the impossible differential attack

99
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:19,169
scenario the now their raw input

100
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,849
difference and their autodifference

101
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:24,520
constitute a major contradiction and

102
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:27,310
they complement this impossible

103
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,549
differential by the propagation law of

104
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:39,850
differential and in the key recovery

105
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:42,700
phase given a pair of plant X since the

106
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:46,030
second part is a impossible differential

107
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:50,500
the output difference here Master P must

108
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:51,070
equal to the autodifference here so for

109
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,590
the first

110
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:56,770
s-trans we know the input difference and

111
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,429
offer difference by the property of the

112
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,250
sbox

113
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:03,220
they can recover the tale involving the

114
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:07,300
first s wrong and in the Darrow

115
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:10,030
correlation attack because we construct

116
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,910
a trivial Darrow correlation

117
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:17,530
approximation with zero input difference

118
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:21,640
and now their low output output mask and

119
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:24,760
then we get the sub case in the first

120
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:28,390
astronaut and use the value here and

121
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:31,450
here to compute the value of the Darrow

122
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:33,520
correlation statistic if the value of

123
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:36,760
the statistic is lower than our

124
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:42,729
predetermined threshold the guesses at K

125
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:45,310
will be rejected and when she she no she

126
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,920
is no more than four we use their low

127
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:51,100
correlation method to realize the

128
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:55,120
distinguishing attack the color

129
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:58,300
reservation is to construct an iterative

130
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,650
zero correlation approximation for the

131
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:06,250
second part so as a propagation rule of

132
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:09,640
linear masks we know the infamous method

133
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:13,240
of arrow so only use the output value

134
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:16,539
enables us to come to compute the error

135
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,910
correlations they're tested and when the

136
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:22,920
value of the thirty-third his take is

137
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:27,610
lower than a threshold and we will see

138
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:31,240
we are not faced with yes cherish and

139
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:34,180
then since the best best attack results

140
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,750
for AES is based on meeting the middle

141
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,359
attack

142
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:42,370
so we also study how these techniques

143
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:45,970
can be applied to a ESP rs400 variants

144
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:51,610
of AES PRF reduced to seven round will

145
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:56,209
give me two in the middle attack since

146
00:08:51,610 --> 00:09:00,959
you're a es PRF is a counterpart of AES

147
00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:07,319
the the attacks are very similar to

148
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:12,239
those for for a ESP F so when he has

149
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:15,949
less than or equal to two we attempt to

150
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:21,380
use the weakness in the first part to to

151
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:25,529
realize to realize K recovery attack

152
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:28,560
so after get after guess the sub case

153
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:32,160
involved in the last 30 runs they use

154
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:36,029
the difference of values here and here

155
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:40,260
to check the contradiction if I forget

156
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:43,380
sub K indeed indeed resulting a

157
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:47,939
contradiction they will reject the

158
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:50,610
cancer sub K and when I say is no more

159
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:54,149
than four we use differential method to

160
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:56,730
launch a recovery attack the my

161
00:09:54,149 --> 00:10:00,990
observation is the second part it does

162
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:04,829
permutation so when a pair of contacts

163
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:08,760
clad as a output then they must excite

164
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:12,420
before the permutation so they construct

165
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:15,149
they construct a iterative differential

166
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:18,029
for the first aspirins and use the

167
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:25,019
property of the sbox to recover the

168
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:30,120
involved sub k so now let's look into

169
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:32,779
the concrete attack on AES PRF the first

170
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:36,930
attack is impossible differential attack

171
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:39,990
first day we construct a to run possible

172
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:45,479
differential and the since since we

173
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:47,790
regard this part as a permutation so so

174
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,329
the output difference here Master P's

175
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:57,120
the master because the autodifference of

176
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:57,729
the PRF so we construct structure as a

177
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,820
plan

178
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:03,339
texts and save the pairs with output

179
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:06,160
difference of this form then they know

180
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:08,829
the autodifference here so for the first

181
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,459
two runs they know the input difference

182
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:15,870
and output difference and then we get

183
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:20,229
the involved FK as a file colored byte

184
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:24,790
and proper forward propagate it to the

185
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:27,940
output of the sub byte of operation so

186
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:30,610
for this S boxes we know the input and

187
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:34,510
output difference with the property of

188
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:37,500
the S box we can obtain the partial

189
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:41,260
information for the first sub K

190
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,389
similarly we know the input and output

191
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,540
difference for the second sub byte

192
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:50,829
operation so we can derive the partial

193
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:54,490
information for the second sub k when

194
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:57,790
the first two sub K are compatible with

195
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:00,459
the K schedule we will reject it since

196
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:06,490
this K validates this impossible

197
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:10,420
differential the second one is a very

198
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:13,269
low correlation luminair attack we set

199
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,000
the input mask and output mask as this

200
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:19,480
one and in order to compute the value

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,170
after the first after two to length of

202
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:27,040
encryption because the involved sub case

203
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:30,729
and compute the value here and then the

204
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:34,389
user value here and here to compute the

205
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:36,970
very correlations dirty a stake if the

206
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:39,819
value of the third has take is lower

207
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:44,250
than a threshold we will reject the

208
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:48,389
involved sub case comparing to the

209
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:52,089
impossible differential they release the

210
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:55,560
attack scenario from chosen plaintext

211
00:12:52,089 --> 00:13:00,180
took two non-plan text as the

212
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,180
competitive increase increases

213
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:08,000
oh we went to notice that in these two

214
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:11,990
attacks we don't restrict the length of

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,050
the second component and this works this

216
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:22,780
attack works only if this part is the

217
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:26,180
random permutation the second attack is

218
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:30,890
as a distinguishing attack based on the

219
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:33,319
row correlation method the main idea is

220
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:36,439
to construct an iterative there a

221
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,320
correlation approximation here and then

222
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,830
we can only use the value here to

223
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:46,460
construct the row correlation statistic

224
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:49,040
so the K step is to construct is the

225
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:52,250
construction of the iterative zero

226
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,670
correlation approximation to reduce the

227
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,350
complexity we need to maximize the

228
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:01,270
number of non-trivial

229
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,380
darío correlation approximation so a

230
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:07,340
exhaustively search for all the

231
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:13,130
truncated linear masks for the three run

232
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:17,480
case they found that the the input mask

233
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:20,260
has at most 11 under Lopez and for the

234
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:25,670
foreign case the input mask has at most

235
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:28,790
eight bytes so this distinguisher they

236
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:35,439
realize distinguishing attack for the

237
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:39,439
corresponding primitives the last one is

238
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,710
a meeting the middle attack they use the

239
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,590
conventional forum distinguisher giving

240
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:51,620
a third style constructed as a first

241
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:55,460
round of the output sequence of 250 55

242
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:57,270
the differences is fully determined by

243
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,630
25 by 4

244
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:03,689
meters so the number of possible

245
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:06,210
sequences is reduced from this value to

246
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,310
this value and in the key recovery

247
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:13,430
attack they put the foreign

248
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,430
distinguisher in the middle of the PRF

249
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:22,110
the the concrete attack is very similar

250
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:25,439
to the attack for AES in the offline

251
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:28,590
phase will construct her hash table to

252
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:32,190
store all the sequence here and in the

253
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:35,730
offline phase we construct structure as

254
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:38,520
a plaintext and selected those pair

255
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:41,310
follow follow this differential pattern

256
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:48,720
and the ghazal intermediate state to

257
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:52,079
recover the involved sub case the

258
00:15:48,720 --> 00:16:02,670
attacks for the AES PF are very similar

259
00:15:52,080 --> 00:16:05,220
to the AES ps4 for even pair we since

260
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:08,180
the first part it is an impossible

261
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,280
differential so the difference here

262
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,140
equals the difference here so for the

263
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,900
last two round we know the input

264
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,150
difference and output difference and use

265
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:21,140
some techniques we can recover the

266
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,140
involved sub case

267
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,330
their correlation attack is similar

268
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,880
because the involves a plate and the

269
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:38,240
count until the statistic face the value

270
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:44,750
here and here the less attack for your

271
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:47,500
AES PRF is a differential attack the no

272
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:51,230
observation is the second part is a

273
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,300
permutation so by controlling the

274
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:58,880
difference here we can control the

275
00:16:53,300 --> 00:17:02,209
internal difference so so the K step is

276
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,790
to construct it an iterative

277
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:09,470
differential for the first four rounds

278
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:14,510
and the differential we use is either

279
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:17,600
straight on the right in the key

280
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:20,359
recovery attack after the kept detecting

281
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,609
a cleaner at the output we know the

282
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:25,760
input difference and output difference

283
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:28,879
then because the internal state internal

284
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,610
difference here and here with all this

285
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,030
non different differences we can derive

286
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:38,780
the input and output difference for all

287
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:41,690
the four subtypes operation and then the

288
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:47,570
property of the sbox we can derive the

289
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:50,510
involves of K at the colored right so

290
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:54,320
this attack reveals our weakness of the

291
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:56,750
OAS PF that is by controlling the output

292
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,379
difference we can control the internal

293
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,380
difference

294
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:10,710
so now they finish all the attacks

295
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:12,959
involved in the paper and this table

296
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:16,130
summarize all that all the attacks

297
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,350
results involved in the paper

298
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:27,179
firstly we include the previous attack

299
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:29,909
when s equals equals 1 and we also also

300
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:32,970
find that for this full construction

301
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:40,200
they only have one round as security

302
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:43,110
margin so based on based on this attack

303
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:48,150
we give a comparison comparison between

304
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:51,389
AES PRF and do a yes period firstly for

305
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:54,960
the from the feasibility of differential

306
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:59,510
attack they know the security of AES PRF

307
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:02,700
is higher than your ASP is and this is

308
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:06,929
consistent with the discussion in the

309
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:13,440
previous FST paper for the prevalence of

310
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:15,510
EDM D structure or EDM structure and the

311
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,760
second observation is both this

312
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:21,540
construction have only one rather than

313
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,760
security margin so it's interesting to

314
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:28,139
consider consider the choice of the

315
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:31,379
parameter the balanced case is a nature

316
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:34,590
choice of the design however our results

317
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:37,440
indicate that as equal to for its

318
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:42,230
potential to be more secure since in

319
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,230
this case the security margin increase

320
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:51,290
so missing is also a still interesting

321
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:54,290
to consider the security of the romani

322
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,290
Myron's

323
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:00,860
that's all for the presentation thank

324
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:00,860
you for your attention

325
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:07,780
