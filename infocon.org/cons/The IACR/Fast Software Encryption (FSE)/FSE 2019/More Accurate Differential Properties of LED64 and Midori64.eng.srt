1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,370
the name of the presentation is more

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:12,900
accurate differential probabilities

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:14,790
properties of LED 64 and Midori 64 we

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,520
will start with the background and

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,730
contribution following that we will

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,109
introduce the related preliminaries and

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,900
then we present a automatic tour for the

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:31,470
search of differential after that we

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:35,219
provide more more accurate differential

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:39,989
analyze of LED and Midori at last we

11
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:43,559
will give a conclusion differential

12
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:46,070
could analyze as well as a month is one

13
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:50,280
of the most fundamental techniques

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:53,539
targeting symmetric K primitives since

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,789
its introduction many investigations

16
00:00:53,539 --> 00:01:00,620
managed to achieve SiC floorball

17
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:05,040
security eigenstate among these works

18
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:07,798
many researchers want to provide more

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,270
accurate distribution of the fixed K

20
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,939
differential probability apart from the

21
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,030
theoretical research another strong

22
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,490
friend in the field of differential is

23
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,710
the automatic tool for the search of

24
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:27,240
differential trio or differential

25
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,329
however most of the techniques focused

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,339
on the search of differential trio

27
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:34,500
although we are able to obtain a large

28
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,610
amount a large number of differential

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,729
trio how to use this trio to to launch

30
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,060
more accurate differential criminalised

31
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:49,860
is an open problem based on this

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:53,909
observation we focus on this big focus

33
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,340
on this in central problems firstly they

34
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:00,329
consider the fixing fixed K probability

35
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:03,570
of a different or trio and then in order

36
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:06,270
to deal with differential effect we

37
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,110
focus we can see there is a fixed K

38
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,169
probability

39
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,620
the differential when multiple trios are

40
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:18,690
available we also consider the victory

41
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:22,650
ratio of it offer differential since

42
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:26,130
since it reflects the effectiveness of

43
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,290
differential crit analyze the

44
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,769
contribution of this paper can be

45
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,679
divided into this into this three parts

46
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:38,580
the first one is we provide an automatic

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,220
tool for the search of differential we

48
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:45,500
know the previous techniques based on

49
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:50,400
SMT can read as the same task however

50
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:53,520
since we use we want to use that server

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,760
to handle differential effect in the

52
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:01,160
following so we also prefer to use that

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:05,370
here to finish the search in task and

54
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:08,820
the second contribution is we provide an

55
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:12,660
automatic method for the search of red

56
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:17,760
pairs of the step function with this

57
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:21,209
method we we found many iterative and

58
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,030
non non iterative differential and this

59
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:28,110
with a new differential we improve the

60
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,959
previous different Rotax the second part

61
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,959
is we provide two models for the

62
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,840
estimation of the vacate space and we

63
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:44,130
apply these models to the analyse of

64
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:48,090
midori 64 before we move on to our our

65
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:54,060
our resource we briefly recall some

66
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:56,959
related preliminaries the content the

67
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,590
concatenation of the of difference

68
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,450
differences for a plus 1 internal states

69
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:06,209
constitute an errand differential

70
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,179
characteristic always a differential

71
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,790
trio the differential probability of a

72
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,970
differential is input difference alpha

73
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:18,450
and output difference beta equals to the

74
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,910
probability that a pair satisfy the

75
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,630
input difference

76
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:27,500
also different simultaneously for a gate

77
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:31,340
function with handy we can define locate

78
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:34,550
differential probability accordingly the

79
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,700
expected differential probability equals

80
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:40,190
the average value of the fixed rate

81
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,550
differential probability over the host

82
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:46,760
whole key space the weight of a

83
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,320
differential or a trio equals to the

84
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:55,880
negative panarin

85
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:59,180
logarithm of the EDG malkov cipher is an

86
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,090
idea of iterative suffer for this ever

87
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,880
the average differential probability

88
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:08,869
over one round is independent of the odd

89
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,450
is independent of the input so in the

90
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,960
differential analyze with the assumption

91
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:17,840
of Independence round case the EDG of

92
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,750
differential characteristic because the

93
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:26,690
product of the EDPs for each round and

94
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:30,200
the EDP of a differential equals the sum

95
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:34,340
of the GDP for all all differential

96
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:37,130
fields within the differential since

97
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:41,020
Markov stuffer is an idea of primitives

98
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:44,270
this kind of evaluation may divide the

99
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:49,430
weight from the rear differential

100
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:52,640
probability many designers won't want to

101
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:55,280
mix their mix their cipher or chip for

102
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,729
both security against if differential

103
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,719
cryptanalyst modern ciphers are designed

104
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:06,440
to withstand the existence of the

105
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,800
dominant in trio for this cipher we may

106
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:13,150
we can use the hypothesis of strategic

107
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:17,510
equivalents to finish the proof of

108
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:20,810
security it plans that for most values

109
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:24,110
of the tail the fixed K differential

110
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:26,740
probability equals the EDG of the

111
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,740
differential

112
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:32,719
afterwards dinner and riemann

113
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:36,140
reconsidered the distribution of the

114
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,470
excape probability they prove that for

115
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:43,450
kilt Nadine cipher the number of great

116
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:48,470
pairs under affects K follows Poisson

117
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:51,530
distribution the the parameter of the

118
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:54,740
Poisson distribution is related to the

119
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:58,880
EDG of the differential it's well known

120
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:02,320
that when the parameter of the Poisson

121
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,870
distribution is sufficiently large the

122
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:09,530
it can be approached approximated by a

123
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:11,780
normal distribution for the approximated

124
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:15,200
normal distribution we know the

125
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:21,169
probability that the k said his flight

126
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:23,240
this condition is about 50% oh we call

127
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:29,900
the case for with fulfilling this

128
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:33,140
convert foundation the ave case since

129
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:38,719
when this case is you is using

130
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:41,870
differential analyze the the the attack

131
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,780
he is more likely to succeed and we

132
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:51,290
donate the set of speak his as a blue

133
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:55,070
key now we present the first

134
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:57,470
contribution of our work it is an

135
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:01,760
automatic method for the search of

136
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:04,660
differential the automatic the automatic

137
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,849
search is based on the set problem it

138
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:12,169
considers the satisfiability of a given

139
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:16,130
boolean formula and we may use crypto

140
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:19,310
mini sets in in all our search for my

141
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:23,000
reason is it is compatible with actual

142
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:25,610
operation and the second reason is it

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,140
supposed the usage of searching for

144
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:32,719
multiple solutions the key step to

145
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:36,890
realize the automatic search is to

146
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:40,760
transform is to construct model for the

147
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:43,610
components of the primitives will

148
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:47,090
transform the proper differential for

149
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:50,080
for these components into set problems

150
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:53,330
in conjunctive normal form and then

151
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,500
invoked that sorta set to third for the

152
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:59,300
differential fail in order to third for

153
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:03,820
differential when it will invoke to

154
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,819
invoke the sets over for several times

155
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,410
we want to remark that the number of

156
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,670
solutions handled by the solver is

157
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:15,050
determined by an individual set problem

158
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:17,120
according to our experience

159
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,530
two to the thirty three is an upper

160
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,530
bound

161
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:24,110
although is this method we we are able

162
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:27,050
to obtain a large number of differential

163
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,660
trio but the crucial problem is how to

164
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:34,550
use this trio to contact differential

165
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:36,800
cryptanalysis early with this problem we

166
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:43,339
move on to the differential analyzer of

167
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:48,109
led since we targets the fresh always

168
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:51,500
help for ability so we need to generate

169
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:55,100
a method to accurately evaluate the

170
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:59,150
differential probability since the step

171
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:02,060
function of led is a public mapping they

172
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:05,900
found that the problem of computing the

173
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:08,390
differential probability is equivalent

174
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:11,449
to the problem of searching for the

175
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:14,750
right pair of a given differential so it

176
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:17,600
turns to the problem of search for the

177
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:20,480
red pairs of a given differential the

178
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,270
first step is to search for many fields

179
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,570
within the differential and then they

180
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:31,280
generate constraints on the value of the

181
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:34,580
red pairs and then they convert this

182
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,339
constraint into set problems and use

183
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:41,120
that sort to search for the red pair of

184
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:43,270
the trio and the red pairs for all the

185
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,570
fields constitute the red

186
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,579
here so the given differential so the

187
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:55,779
remaining problem is how to generate

188
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:58,080
this constraint for the red hair the

189
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:02,380
first introducer closely-related

190
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:06,640
conception for a differential so we

191
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:13,510
combine all the all the input values of

192
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:19,569
red pair into a set as and the output

193
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:22,980
values of all the red pairs organized as

194
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:26,410
a set G and the differential is called a

195
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:29,890
coded planner differential if F and G

196
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:32,319
are fans of spaces and the Mackay is

197
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:35,290
planner if all the differential over a

198
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,020
top-10 are and it's easy to prove that

199
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:41,469
as layer composed of the parallel

200
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:44,500
parallel applications of s boxes is

201
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:48,430
planner when all the S boxes have

202
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:52,029
differential uniformity of for so for

203
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:55,510
the Hilton 18 cipher if the a slayer is

204
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:58,329
planner for any differential tree always

205
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:01,569
input different stir tax and the output

206
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:05,979
difference Delta Y we know the set F and

207
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:10,120
C offense spaces so we can construct

208
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:15,279
matrix and vectors so that for a back

209
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:18,370
for vector if a vector falls into the

210
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:26,410
offense space if and only if it status

211
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:30,010
by this this equation and since the

212
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:33,850
structure of the step function follows

213
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:38,230
the chaos meeting cipher and an LED you

214
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:41,770
utilize s boxes with differential

215
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:44,110
uniformity of for so with the previous

216
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:46,689
two equations we can derive the first

217
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:50,680
constraints for the red pair of the

218
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:53,440
stack function this constraint is come

219
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,109
from the difference of the differential

220
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,450
trio

221
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,720
apart from the constraints from the

222
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:02,270
differential trail they repair the

223
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,840
internal states of the red pair follows

224
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:09,439
the encryption rule so these three

225
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:13,340
constraints can fully determine the red

226
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,890
pair of of a differential trail and then

227
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,950
they transform these constraints into

228
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:22,430
that problem in conjunctive normal form

229
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:24,710
and call set forward to search for all

230
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:29,270
the red pairs corresponding to a

231
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:31,520
differential trio to sample to sum up in

232
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:34,010
order to obtain the right pairs of a

233
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,050
given differential they need to firstly

234
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:38,420
search for many differential trails

235
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:40,510
within the differential and then

236
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,630
generate matrix and the vectors

237
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:49,730
corresponding to the trio and applying

238
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:52,600
sets over to get the red red pair with

239
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:55,640
this method we may have found many

240
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,280
iterative and non iterative differential

241
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,860
for led and with the improved

242
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:10,189
differential we improve the previous

243
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:12,710
related key attack now the last part is

244
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:17,050
about the differential and the knives of

245
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:21,620
Midori 64 considering the case schedule

246
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:24,199
in this part firstly firstly we will say

247
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,380
for each differential trio of the

248
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:30,770
differential we can derive a subspace of

249
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:33,500
the k space and this space covered the

250
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:40,060
vacant space of the different different

251
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:43,700
field and the union of this set is

252
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:47,479
related to the vaycay ratio of the of

253
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:50,000
the differential and then okay falls

254
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,610
into more than one space the

255
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
corresponding fixed K probability will

256
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:58,510
increase since since the corresponding

257
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,060
trio will hold same attained

258
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,730
simultaneously so from the Vale of the

259
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,750
divan

260
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:09,720
we want to minimize the vacay ratio and

261
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:12,360
from the veil of the attacker we want to

262
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,410
detect the maximum number of compatible

263
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,420
characteristics and the case the case

264
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:23,100
validates all the compatible

265
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:26,880
characteristic might be used in our wiki

266
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:32,790
attack so in this part on the one hand

267
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:35,760
we they want to search they want to give

268
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:38,760
a method to evaluate a weekly ratio and

269
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:42,330
on the other hand we want to determine

270
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:50,670
returns the maximum number of compatible

271
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:53,340
pair characteristics for the key of

272
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,819
enigma cipher when the oscillator is

273
00:15:53,340 --> 00:16:00,240
tanner we can derive linear constraints

274
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:03,830
on the involved sub case differential

275
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,800
trio have the necessary condition for

276
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:11,670
differential trio have for differential

277
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:15,959
trial have read pair is the S sub K 14

278
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:19,560
to the offense base and otherwise if the

279
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:22,200
sub K falls out of this offense base the

280
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:26,339
differential trio will have no red pair

281
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:29,360
so for for a differential consists of

282
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:32,490
multiple characteristic in fact

283
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,130
particularly with all characteristics to

284
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:37,980
be impossible trio the differential

285
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:42,030
under this fixed key turns into an

286
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:48,600
impossible differential and we donate

287
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:52,439
this this case as this case as a okay

288
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,590
and clearly the weekly space is powered

289
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,650
by the complement complementary set of I

290
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,650
K

291
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:06,589
so in the previous description we know

292
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:10,849
the vaycay space of each fail is covered

293
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:13,369
by the set the set D K so the vaycay

294
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:16,869
space of the diversion is covered by the

295
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:20,030
union of this way k and this probability

296
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:25,629
constitutes a major upper bound for the

297
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:30,800
weekly ratio so we turned the problem of

298
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:33,800
evaluating the vacate ratio into to a

299
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:37,940
problem of estimate as the making the

300
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:41,720
test of this side and the sense we found

301
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:44,510
that handling the unions the

302
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,540
intersection set is more convenient than

303
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:50,060
the Union set so we applied the mountain

304
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:53,780
slope here to transform the Union set

305
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:56,840
into intersection set and then the

306
00:17:53,780 --> 00:18:01,100
proposed and automate automatic

307
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:05,270
automatic method to evaluate success of

308
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:08,000
this set the main idea is to convert the

309
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:10,730
conference on the fed into closest

310
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,600
leaning conjunctive normal in that

311
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:20,150
problem and invokes that over to solve

312
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:24,080
the searching task as a result we

313
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:27,440
provide full round with provide to fall

314
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:34,449
and differential with a ratio matched or

315
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:38,780
lower than 50% and in order to validate

316
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:42,530
to violate validates the theoretic

317
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:46,100
results they do some tests with random

318
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:50,270
key and experimental results fits very

319
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:53,959
well with the theoretical value and from

320
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:55,930
the view of the designer if this kind of

321
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,120
differential is utilized

322
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:03,710
yee-yee or differential analyzed they

323
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,719
attack her will probably fail since he

324
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,920
can't fund read pairs

325
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,920
under the red cape

326
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:18,440
the last the last the last problem is

327
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:22,009
the maximum number of compatible

328
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:26,240
characteristics firstly we introduced

329
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:29,740
are closely related problems the next

330
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:33,500
puzzle problems given a set of

331
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:37,850
polynomial functions the max max puzzle

332
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:40,309
problems is to find fan X such that it

333
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:46,129
satisfies the maximum number of

334
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:49,460
polynomials in the function set and in

335
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:53,860
the previous state district description

336
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:57,710
we know K falls into the current the

337
00:19:53,860 --> 00:20:01,729
egghead space of the trio if and only if

338
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:04,399
the K satisfy this linear constraints

339
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:08,210
and we donate this linear constraints

340
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:10,489
SST they found that determining the

341
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,250
maximum number of compatible

342
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:16,190
characteristic is equivalent to finding

343
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:19,210
case so such that the number of

344
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:25,340
functions following this contradiction

345
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:28,330
these conditions is maximized to solve

346
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:31,539
the max puzzle problem there are many

347
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:34,549
automatic methods and we use an

348
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:39,169
automatic method based on sets who

349
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:42,620
settle this problem as a result they

350
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:45,100
apply this method to the analyzer for on

351
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:48,428
differential of Natori

352
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:52,399
we found the maximum number of

353
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:55,820
compatible characteristic and since the

354
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:58,899
case validate all the compatible

355
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:01,759
characteristics will have higher

356
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:05,689
differential probability they found that

357
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:08,809
edge subspaces the EDG of the

358
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:14,360
differential is improved from about two

359
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:18,200
to the minors 24 - 2 to the minors 16

360
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,219
and we also find that the probability

361
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,630
that

362
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:27,740
hey is this enhanced probability it's at

363
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:31,250
least two to the manor stealth all the

364
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:37,280
theoretical results validate this random

365
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:39,940
test now we finish all the contents of

366
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:44,000
the paper and give a conclusion here

367
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:46,730
firstly we propose an automatic measured

368
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,090
based on set to search for the

369
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:52,460
differential and then they propose a

370
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:56,840
method to search for the right pair of

371
00:21:52,460 --> 00:22:01,340
the step function of led 64 and at first

372
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:05,389
they propose two models to estimate the

373
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:07,250
case phase of our differential we want

374
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,860
to remark that all the automatic

375
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:13,580
measures can be generalized generalized

376
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:16,459
to analyze other Zephyrs and the results

377
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,830
in this paper either straight set for

378
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,440
some lightweight block ciphers with a

379
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:23,689
simple case schedule they need to pay

380
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:28,039
more attention to the analyse of the

381
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:32,090
differential an open problem is how to

382
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:36,650
utilize this automatic tools to provide

383
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:41,049
more precess evaluation for the linear

384
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:42,919
high effect that's all for the

385
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:44,610
presentations thank you for your

386
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:49,910
attention

387
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:52,909

388
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,910
Christian

389
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:39,470
do you think this technique okay thank

390
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,440
you

391
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:46,000
and thank all the speakers of this

392
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:50,090
session and next is the coffee break and

393
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,030
the next session will start at 11:30

394
00:23:50,090 --> 00:24:00,980
so let's come back at 11:30

395
00:23:54,030 --> 00:24:00,980
