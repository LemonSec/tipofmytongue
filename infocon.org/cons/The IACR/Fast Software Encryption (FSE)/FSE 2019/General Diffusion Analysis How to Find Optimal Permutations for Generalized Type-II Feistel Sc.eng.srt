1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,340
how to find optimal permutations for

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:09,870
generalized type two feistel schemes

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,120
this is joint work between victor

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,540
kershaw

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,970
Damon Commerce and gal Tama and gal will

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,500
give the talk and so this paper wins the

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,970
runner-up award for the longest title

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,560
there is tomorrow one paper with one

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,640
character more in the title but you

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,640
almost won okay

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,170
type two faisal permutation and tie two

12
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,590
festival schemes and how to find the

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,360
best permutations in the fight zone so I

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,559
assume you already know what feistel

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,719
network do you are your task as a

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,430
designer is to construct a cypher

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,390
permutation or something like this and

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,940
the states may be the state may be big

19
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,920
so you do I will only do the part of the

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,959
word every no indeed on half the block

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,739
and then to influence the whole block

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,680
and week so my output to the other half

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,840
and since it is not enough oh no problem

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,409
I iterate and this is quite a popular

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,830
design and it was generalized at the end

26
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:20,340
of the 1980s and this time instead

27
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,710
instead of dividing the state into two

28
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,259
blocks you divide it into K blocks which

29
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,548
means you have more functions Raja much

30
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:31,530
simpler and after that you swap in some

31
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,759
manner the different blocks so in the

32
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,850
original paper the swap was simply

33
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:41,220
rotation but we can we can actually do

34
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,460
more than that and again this is a very

35
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,158
popular design with different number of

36
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,009
blocks but the problem with this

37
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,960
construction is how many ones do you do

38
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,680
you have to do before you have some kind

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,860
of diffusion

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,229
so here what do I mean by diffusion I'm

41
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,380
talking about what's called maximum

42
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:04,140
diffusion one and basically you look for

43
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,210
example as the first block and you

44
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,090
follow the different hours and you will

45
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,609
count how many blocks you have

46
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,140
influenced after certain of ones so here

47
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,040
after one one you have influence

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:20,069
two blocks then three and five and

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,410
things at seven and here after 5 turns

50
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:24,208
you've influenced every block and Susy

51
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,819
you say that the different round for the

52
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:29,940
first block is 5 and you do that for

53
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:36,329
every other block here we have here we

54
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:39,739
need six ones etc etc so JD beyond this

55
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:43,950
criterion is tough kind of first sieve

56
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:45,810
criterion for choosing a permutation for

57
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,910
a feistel network because it's for first

58
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,760
T because it's very easy to compute but

59
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,220
it's maybe not exactly very precise to

60
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,190
assess the security of the cipher but

61
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,170
it's nonetheless linked with mini

62
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,300
attacks which are a very powerful

63
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,549
against generalized feistel structure

64
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,040
like impossible attacks and saturation

65
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,510
attacks and of course it's was done for

66
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,260
encryption but you can do the same for

67
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,630
the equation and you say that maximum

68
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,370
diffusion round or D are for short of

69
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,370
the permutation by

70
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:26,190
this permutation so with the pointer is

71
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:29,510
run out of battery you say so that the

72
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,730
diffusion 1 for this permutation is 6

73
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,440
and so there is a seminal paper on how

74
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,238
to improve the diffusion of feistel

75
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,940
network which was done by suzaki and

76
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,660
mini Matsu and presented and FSE 2010

77
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:45,180
and what was their main focus was there

78
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,700
the idea that that the permutation you

79
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,530
use all you have to kind of block you

80
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,619
have blocked that are at the input of a

81
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:56,790
function and block the output and the

82
00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:00,450
blocks that help diffusion are the even

83
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,510
one and the odd ones are less important

84
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:06,030
for shall we say so yeah the UVC could

85
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,190
be that or between two ones let's swap

86
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,380
the walls of these two kind of blocks

87
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,840
that's what we call even odd general

88
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,910
fights and networks where you send the

89
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:21,140
even blocks to the odd blocks and vice

90
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:24,150
versa and they conducted a search of

91
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:26,280
general of a permutation of 216 block

92
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:30,530
and proved that control

93
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,530
- the first result

94
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:39,090
the blocks by using a different

95
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:44,310
permutation you can actually have a much

96
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:46,909
faster diffusion and moreover they gave

97
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,520
a genuine construction we were diffusion

98
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:52,889
logarithmic in the number of blocks and

99
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,139
so what our contribution our

100
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:58,080
contribution is we give an upper bound

101
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:02,460
and more than that a constructive upper

102
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:06,289
bound on how many even odd even odd GFS

103
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:09,719
we have up to some notion of equivalence

104
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:13,590
using this constructive metal we can do

105
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:17,880
the earth exhaustive search for up to 24

106
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:20,849
blocks when we when exhaustive shots is

107
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,400
out of which we define a new criterion

108
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:26,490
to reduce the search space which we call

109
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:30,270
cohesion free def and in a few words it

110
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:32,010
means that we want to have a special

111
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:37,200
criterion for the first few ones of

112
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:40,039
diffusion will solve is it the generic

113
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,740
construction of suzaki and minamitsu

114
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:46,830
where we can in some cases improve the

115
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,800
result by one one that Syria that are

116
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:53,400
the bottom results here we go from 12 to

117
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:58,229
11 and 14 to 13 and we also studied the

118
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:01,440
case of non even odd permutations so I

119
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:03,840
said we study GFS up to equivalence

120
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,469
what is equivalence of GFS it's very

121
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,419
simple

122
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:09,419
you have a GFS and let's say you want to

123
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:13,229
change exchange the world of different

124
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,789
blocks so you'll swap them that doesn't

125
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:17,310
change the cryptographic property you

126
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:20,969
are changing you're just changing how

127
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:23,760
your number your blocks so this is an

128
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,490
equivalence relation but in fact if you

129
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,190
do that namely you end up with something

130
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,930
that doesn't look like type 2 general

131
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,900
feistel anymore that is where you have

132
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,349
the structure of one function every two

133
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,210
blocks so to keep the structure you have

134
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:41,759
to permute using a

135
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,620
special kind of permutation which we

136
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,069
call a permutation of pairs where you

137
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,069
basically swap blocks by packets of two

138
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:56,759
of our four so notation I call this set

139
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,669
s KP okay it's the number of blocks and

140
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,680
P is for pair and so we have a notion of

141
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:06,299
pair equivalence that is PI 1 and PI 2

142
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:10,860
the committee to plan mutations here

143
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:13,710
away covenant if and only if they are

144
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:17,250
conjugated with each other we've one of

145
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:21,090
this pair equivalent permutation so how

146
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,160
many permutations do we have up to this

147
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,258
notion of equivalence well the first

148
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,930
thing to notice is that if you have an

149
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:32,070
even odd permutation you can write it as

150
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:34,710
two smaller permutations over K over 2

151
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,960
elements simply the first one tells you

152
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,989
where you send the even elements and the

153
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,739
second tells you where you send the

154
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:46,080
elements and so this means that the

155
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,759
number of classes well is trivially

156
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,729
upper bounded by how many permutations

157
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:55,229
you have and the lower bound is actually

158
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:58,729
comes actually from the fact that since

159
00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:02,699
you're using equivalence relation on the

160
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:06,830
SEO set which have the K over 2

161
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:12,780
factorial square element and you have

162
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:15,840
permuted you are sorry you have

163
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,789
equivalence up to a set with K over two

164
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,210
elements that is permutation of pairs

165
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:26,479
big blocks so you have in total at least

166
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:29,310
K over 2 factorial equivalence classes

167
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,098
but in fact the idea is that you don't

168
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:36,000
have to exhaust all these big set you

169
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:38,909
can reduce the search space where the

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,240
first permutation by one can be simply

171
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:45,450
in one single one in a conjugacy class

172
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,810
of sk / - it is regular conjugacy class

173
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:51,150
and so you save up K over 2 factorial

174
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,888
like to replace by the number of

175
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,809
conjugacy class

176
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:59,629
in the permutation group of a key

177
00:08:54,809 --> 00:09:02,639
element and to see how big the saving is

178
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:04,369
you go from factorial K over 2 to

179
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:11,519
something that is in Big O of

180
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:13,589
exponential square root of K and so we

181
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,759
did a sausage search search using this

182
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:20,160
method so here from 6 to 24 are the best

183
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,549
I was a diffusion one of the best

184
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,290
permutation that exists so up to 16 that

185
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:28,108
are the result of Sasaki and minamitsu

186
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:31,858
and after that which is our results and

187
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:35,850
we also computed how many classes there

188
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:38,759
are that are optimal and we can see a

189
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,220
building little bit strange that is for

190
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,619
18 blocks there are only two optimal

191
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,139
permutation for 22 there are four and

192
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:49,109
they have a different one of eight but

193
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:51,480
in between there is that 20 that is a

194
00:09:49,109 --> 00:09:55,619
that has diffusion on of nine but there

195
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:59,160
are a huge number of them and so what

196
00:09:55,619 --> 00:10:03,059
happens here in fact there is a problem

197
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:05,009
with lower bound it is that before any

198
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:08,850
doing actual exhaustive search you use

199
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:12,119
you can have a lower bound on how many

200
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:14,939
ones you will need and this all bond in

201
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:17,339
fact is can be seen as follows

202
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:19,498
so you for each round you will be

203
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,290
counting how many blocks you have

204
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:25,379
influenced so here after 0 1 you have

205
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:31,469
computed you have a single let's create

206
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:33,089
an active block here we have 1 2 3 5 and

207
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,230
if you I could continue an Avery you

208
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:36,329
would think oh that's a Fibonacci

209
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:41,730
sequence I'm gonna have an 8

210
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:45,539
no I have a 7 why because there has been

211
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,949
a collision between two blocks I teach

212
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:48,869
you have something that you would have

213
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:50,729
expect to have this kind of half the

214
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:53,220
block separating two with respect to

215
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:58,589
diffusion but here that does not happen

216
00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:01,559
because you have two two different paths

217
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:03,239
influenced the same block and so you

218
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,399
have this lower bound say if you have no

219
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:06,600
collisions you have the Fibonacci

220
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,630
sequence and so be

221
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,699
you have that if you look the Fibonacci

222
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:17,009
number the dr the diaz Fibonacci numbers

223
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:22,199
times two must be at least equal to the

224
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:24,810
number of blocks and so based on this

225
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:27,959
idea when the exhaustive search is

226
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:31,258
intractable we try to reduce the search

227
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:33,899
space to permutation where the number of

228
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:37,889
collisions in the first few round is

229
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:40,529
very small or does not happen at all in

230
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:42,779
fact and so there's this new creature on

231
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:45,839
which we call collision-free depth or CD

232
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:50,189
for short which is basically the number

233
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:52,560
of wand before any collision happened so

234
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:55,079
here the collision free def is for this

235
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,449
particular block is three but if you

236
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:00,449
were to begin on the block before this

237
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:03,029
for one sorry but if you were to begin

238
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:05,819
on the blocks to the left that would be

239
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:09,449
free so the collision frida for this

240
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:12,920
particular permutation is three and so

241
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:15,359
we for all the permutations we computed

242
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,810
what was a collision free def and

243
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,660
classified it so here are the results

244
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:23,910
because of that fibonacci fibonacci

245
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,209
bound we also have a bound on the

246
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:29,850
collision free def which is given on

247
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:34,138
third wall and so from this result we

248
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:36,240
can see that okay now I except for maybe

249
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:40,199
for the Entine but in the only two

250
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,589
permutations may be an outlier here we

251
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:45,329
can always almost always find

252
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:47,550
permutations with high collision free

253
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:50,699
death which means that it may be a

254
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:54,599
relevant criterion but again it seemed

255
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:56,790
that most permutation don't have a very

256
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,639
high collision free depth so there is

257
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:04,860
some kind of trade-off between how much

258
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:07,550
how big the space is and the optimality

259
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,740
of your results you may find and

260
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:13,979
particular is very very interesting case

261
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:17,790
case which is the case for K equals 26

262
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,470
so as I said before this case is too big

263
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,810
for exhaustive search

264
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:25,290
but if you look at the Fibonacci bound

265
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:30,839
26 divided by 2 is 13 and 14 is a

266
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:33,750
Fibonacci number that may be a problem

267
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,780
with the bound here maybe not Fibonacci

268
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:39,000
of 8 but maybe if you have 8 minus 1 but

269
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:42,720
never neither the reasoning is correct

270
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,800
and so if you wanted to have a

271
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,290
permutation on 20 and 26 blocks with a

272
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,930
diffusion amount of 8 you would need an

273
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:55,709
optimal collision-free def that is no

274
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:58,229
collision until the last one and we can

275
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,340
actually test if sertraline exists using

276
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,830
an exhaustive search

277
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,690
so we perform at the octave search for

278
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:06,750
any permutation we have a collision free

279
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:11,150
def at least 4 and the best result we

280
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:17,910
found was 10 so this proves that the

281
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:20,280
best the best permutation cannot have a

282
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:26,089
diffusion amount of 8 it must be over 9

283
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:30,360
or 10 and so we transform our algorithm

284
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:32,940
to perform this random search and we use

285
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,730
it with equation freed F at 3 which was

286
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,160
the biggest the biggest value we had not

287
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:41,610
tested yet and found one result with 9

288
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,819
which is then optimal so it means that

289
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:48,750
the equation for F is indeed useful

290
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:53,460
criterion for search for finding

291
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:56,970
permutations to look a little bit to

292
00:14:53,460 --> 00:15:01,350
have a look bit more detail in what we

293
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:03,450
do if you have your feistel network here

294
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:08,670
if you sim line the things a bit and

295
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:12,240
look at what happens on block 0 you have

296
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,860
that block 0 influence while block 0

297
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,620
when you went for the function but also

298
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,410
block 3 three infants six etcetera

299
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,890
etcetera and so basically the idea of

300
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:25,020
collision free def is the number of ones

301
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:28,530
you would involve steps you can do

302
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:31,730
before the given number appears twice on

303
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,730
one of the leaves

304
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,830
but in fact this representation is a bit

305
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:44,030
tedious to handle because you have that

306
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:45,560
kind of unbalanced graph and as was

307
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:49,189
already done in the suzaki and mini

308
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:53,780
Matsu paper you can represent feistel

309
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:58,250
network by continuing blocks by sets of

310
00:15:53,780 --> 00:16:01,850
two so you consider only a kind of super

311
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:05,180
block that we group block 0 and 1 block

312
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:07,670
2 & 3 block 4 & 5 but 6 & 7 and this

313
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:15,530
nicely simplified into a balanced binary

314
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:18,439
tree and the advantage of this

315
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:20,569
representation while it's a binary tree

316
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,060
when you it with a core you have fewer

317
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:26,720
nodes because you're grouping blocks by

318
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:31,150
2 so overall it's something really more

319
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,730
simple than what you had before but the

320
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:36,680
major inconvenient it that is that you

321
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:39,290
it does not represent a unique

322
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:43,489
permutation because here you lost

323
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:45,949
information of when you say that the

324
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:50,990
super block 0 influences the super block

325
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:56,510
1 that is the edge under white you do

326
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:59,600
not know if this is done we with a net

327
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:01,370
with even to add edge or with an odd to

328
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,430
even add so you need additional

329
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:07,069
information which we can represent as a

330
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:10,370
graph coloring of this tree with two

331
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:13,970
colors one for even to odd and what for

332
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:16,550
odd to even and actually what was used

333
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:19,130
in the second minimus newspaper to

334
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:22,310
construct this kind of graph is the so

335
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:29,770
called the born graph and the born graph

336
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:29,770
is simply a graph with two to the N

337
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:39,679
nodes the nodes are labeled using all

338
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:41,389
the binary numbers with n n bits so here

339
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,380
is the case for N equals to 2 so you

340
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:53,630
have 0 0 0 1 1 0 and 1 1 and you draw an

341
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:56,690
edge as the following you take for

342
00:17:53,630 --> 00:18:00,050
example 0 0 you do up the leftmost bit

343
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:03,230
so you end up with 0 and if you are and

344
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:07,220
you add the label on the end the adder

345
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:10,130
to form the the new label of the the

346
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:13,370
label of the new node so 0 0 drops the

347
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:17,930
leftmost 0 add a 0 to the right to the

348
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:20,540
right sorry you end up still on 0 0 0 0

349
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:24,440
drops the leftmost 0 add a 1 to the

350
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:28,730
right you end up on 0 1 etc etc and if

351
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:32,480
you translate that in terms of over 3 or

352
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:36,410
presentation it it simply means that

353
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:41,690
you're feeling you're filling the tree

354
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:44,930
with the least possible numbers so this

355
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:48,730
is kind of a way to avoid collision

356
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:51,890
collisions on the first ones

357
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:53,390
and how do you color it well for this

358
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,570
particular example you not have much

359
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:58,070
choice of two swapping the color blues

360
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,070
and wet so blue

361
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:05,090
for examples mean you go from even to

362
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:10,250
add and wet means you go from odd to

363
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:13,879
even this also means that from the tree

364
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:18,560
presentation you go left means Rock

365
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:21,650
means red and white it's blue but this

366
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,659
is the coloring used in the suzaki and

367
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:27,650
minimus ooh paper but actually you can

368
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:32,630
exhaust all the possible coloring with a

369
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:40,610
complexity of 2 to the K over 4 and we

370
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:43,520
did this for K up to 128 and we obtained

371
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:51,080
better result we can gain one round for

372
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:53,860
the 64 and 128 blocks for the value of K

373
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:56,889
64 and 128

374
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:59,899
and so until now I was have spoken about

375
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:02,800
the upper bound the exhaustive search

376
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:08,150
the criterion of cohesion free dev and

377
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:12,050
the graph coloring ID I have not spoken

378
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:14,740
about the non even-odd permutations so I

379
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:19,280
will give a few words about this

380
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:21,860
basically most of the previous most of

381
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,780
the previous ID still work that he seems

382
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,120
there are based on graph you can define

383
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,040
the graph for the faisal you can follow

384
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,889
the line that works rough is the same so

385
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:34,100
collision free def stays the same you

386
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,510
can adapt the graph coloring IDs of

387
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:39,290
course you still have the question of

388
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:42,110
what graph do you choose and for the

389
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:45,649
number of classes so in the even odd

390
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:47,659
case you had this inequality and for the

391
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:51,170
general case you have something that is

392
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:54,530
like this so with most interesting is

393
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:58,850
the upper bound n K is the number of

394
00:20:54,530 --> 00:21:01,040
conjugacy class and the second is the

395
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:07,189
number of representative of the Y

396
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:09,470
cassette of SK mod the key K blocks

397
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:14,030
permutation model o the permutation of

398
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:18,080
path where you swapped a mutation by PI

399
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:20,990
super blocks in fact so we can again do

400
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,120
exhaustive search we did this and we

401
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,130
found and surprisingly as was noticed in

402
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,800
so they came in a met whose paper that

403
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:30,260
not even all permutations are generally

404
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:34,550
generally worse than even odd

405
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:37,370
permutations so in conclusion we study

406
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:40,610
type to generalize vital structures when

407
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:42,560
in fact we studied permutations up to

408
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,540
pair equivalence we give an upper bound

409
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,929
on them across to achieve upper bound

410
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:51,800
which allowed us to run exhaustive

411
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:55,250
search for up to 24 blocks for the even

412
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:58,669
odd case or 20 for the general case and

413
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:01,250
we introduced this creature collision

414
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:03,230
dev criterion which is the criterion

415
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:06,659
when you want to avoid collision in the

416
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:08,879
first few ones and finally we

417
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:11,249
by the graph constructions on the de

418
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:14,728
boigne graph and improved the result for

419
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:16,259
K equals 64 and 128 thank you for your

420
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:29,519
present for your attention do you have

421
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:32,700
any questions thank you very much no

422
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,679
questions I will ask you questions so

423
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,149
you look at the optimal diffusion did

424
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,330
they have special structure or do they

425
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:41,129
look more like random graphs the optimal

426
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:44,809
solution today I have special structure

427
00:22:41,129 --> 00:22:44,809
if you look at them or are they random

428
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:57,539
that depends for blogs are thousands of

429
00:22:55,769 --> 00:23:00,989
solutions so we did not look at all of

430
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:03,239
them and for the K equals 18 they're

431
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:08,489
only 2 but I don't remember if they have

432
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:10,409
any structure so I also have a question

433
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:12,960
about your definition of full diffusion

434
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:15,359
so I mean of course the the left/right

435
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,129
trick solves it a bit but I mean if

436
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,649
there's a linear dependency just it goes

437
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:21,629
to an X or to the next round

438
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:23,340
it also seen as full diffusion but of

439
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:24,899
course if it goes to an F function there

440
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,728
is much more diffusion among the pits

441
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:29,008
does your analysis take this into

442
00:23:26,729 --> 00:23:31,499
account or you just say no you we just

443
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:34,340
see the F function as a kind of black

444
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:34,340
box and we assumed

445
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:45,320
but you don't distinguish between X or

446
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:49,399
and F function diffusion or any more

447
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:52,550
questions if not let's thank gather than

448
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:57,150
all the other speakers of this session

449
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:57,149
[Applause]
