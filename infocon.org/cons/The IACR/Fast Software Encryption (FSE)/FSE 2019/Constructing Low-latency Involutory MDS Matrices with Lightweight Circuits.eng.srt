1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,479
the next talk is entitled constructing

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,140
low-latency inventory and the as

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,059
matricies

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:15,149
with lightweight circuits its joint work

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:18,029
between showing you a only story see why

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:23,970
soon shy only see our way in line who

7
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:26,460
and surely will give a talk senator

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,759
Allah introduction it's a joint work

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:34,410
with waste one timely to where the

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:39,329
highway and they who arrange introduce

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:41,760
our work for from five part first is the

12
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,940
diffusion matrices that diffusion

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,190
players are typically realized with

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:50,579
linear operations expressed as matrices

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:54,390
and internal dependencies as much as

16
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,370
possible the diffusion property of the

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,300
diffusion matrix is up to its branch

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,010
number he has read carrier definition

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,309
it's a measurement of a minimal number

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,700
of nonzero words of input and output and

21
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:12,479
there is a it has a upper bound called

22
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,490
single atom bound the matrix achieve

23
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,810
lasting wladim single atom bound is

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,220
called MDS matrix regularly lighter

25
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,040
weights perimeter we have following

26
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,320
types of diffusion layers the first in

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,090
the bit level permutations such as

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:33,089
present gift the second is the bitwise

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:38,090
xor and the rotations such as skinny

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:40,909
craft under stirred in the maximum

31
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:46,140
distance separable

32
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:52,130
MDS matrices such as a yes and almost

33
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:53,790
MDS matrices that had victory and comer

34
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,979
he

35
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:01,590
definition of MDS matrices and

36
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:05,189
inevitable NK by a binary matrix is a

37
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:09,709
MDS over k ambit worse if and only if

38
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:13,900
the branch number of a equals K past one

39
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:19,360
here is a example of MDS matrix in a yes

40
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:22,090
besides its circulant la vie de charity

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,830
is an approach used to desire around

42
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,250
transformations that combined efficiency

43
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:31,360
and resistance against differential and

44
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:33,670
linear analysis amnio's matrices are in

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,310
accordance with flood strategy have

46
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:39,599
advantages as diffusion layers in AI

47
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:42,060
traits block cipher one is its

48
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,600
relatively small number of runs

49
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:50,549
contribute to low latency device here is

50
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:55,680
a comparison we have three cipher or

51
00:02:50,549 --> 00:03:00,310
they are all 128-bit block size and

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,610
128-bit to key or key size for skinny of

53
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:08,349
bitwise XOR constructions the number of

54
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:11,980
his is around it's 40 y4 Natori almost

55
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:15,609
MDS it's number of rounds it's 20 and a

56
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:19,780
yes the MDS construction is number of

57
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:23,769
brawn is only 10 the other advantage of

58
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:28,959
it is simple and clear security proofs

59
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:32,260
followed by AES we have some

60
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:36,630
construction strategies the first is EXO

61
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:39,340
and rotation based such as height a

62
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:43,889
second is the iteration based such as

63
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:48,010
font on hash functions the third is a

64
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:52,930
special type based such as succulent of

65
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:59,530
sake no admah tablets Kochi in rotary at

66
00:03:52,930 --> 00:04:05,950
a and the stock is search based to talk

67
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:08,709
by 200 and ruined for amore matrices

68
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:12,700
here is the definition the square matrix

69
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:16,988
Larry its own inverse well it's a means

70
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:19,659
M squared equals to identity matrix in

71
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:22,299
rotary matrices are preferable in terms

72
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,970
of hardware implementation things the

73
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,400
same circuit can be used when the

74
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:31,560
inverse is required

75
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,870
advantage of MDS and the Amala Tory

76
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,419
makes the military matrices more

77
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,330
preferable involute or MDS matrices

78
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:46,859
applied in some ciphers such as a

79
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:49,469
newbies iceberg and prince now we go to

80
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,610
a conjunction of lightweights in

81
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,080
military MDS matrices firstly we need to

82
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:58,680
give the introduction of metrics we

83
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,080
asked estimated where cost of a linear

84
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:05,040
operation and the number of actual case

85
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:08,550
required in its implementation but it's

86
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,610
mb hard to obtain the minimal minimal

87
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:15,210
numbers of actual codes required by

88
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:20,610
Boyer's theorem that is for any field

89
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:24,359
shortest linear program is mb ha so only

90
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:27,960
metrics determine our bounds are

91
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:32,130
available one here we only give to our

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:36,299
bounds one is direct actual count of the

93
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:40,740
oxy it's the it equals the Hamming

94
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:44,419
weight of matrix - the number - it's low

95
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:47,940
number and the other is the global

96
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:49,919
optimization it corresponds to a good

97
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,349
linear straight line program which is

98
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:59,039
based on certain SLP heuristics such as

99
00:05:52,349 --> 00:06:03,240
bias and we denote this as the SLP here

100
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:06,659
is a comparison for multiplication by

101
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,750
this matrix is direct its directed axle

102
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,470
count is for y it's a CLP actual case

103
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:15,660
it's three that's following the SLP

104
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:19,560
actual cases last line acts deoxy cousin

105
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:23,120
because the intermedia where variables T

106
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,120
1 is used twice

107
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:35,170
we introduced some previous work

108
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:39,010
relative to relative to our works Sakai

109
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:41,380
terrified lightweight 16 by 16 very I

110
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:46,960
mean the as matrix of less form

111
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:51,250
LST is equals to the companion matrix of

112
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:58,060
X to the 4 plus X 2 plus X plus 1

113
00:06:51,250 --> 00:07:02,260
and it's SAR px4 case it's 42 and crowns

114
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:04,560
at a obtained by the weight 32 by 32 a

115
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,060
moratorium diaz matrix by applying

116
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,040
subfield construction to their formula

117
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:14,080
we all have stop feared construction is

118
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:19,320
just a double each sub matrix of some

119
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:23,080
matrices of the the matrix now it's and

120
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:28,990
it's SAR P XOR gates it's double here

121
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:35,800
the Crown's matrix is has a extra count

122
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:37,480
of 8284 so like we extracting the

123
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,120
structure left for me because of the

124
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,410
former two matrices are forms of it this

125
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,900
well the difference is real choice of a

126
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:49,540
the matrix a let me generalize Ahn try

127
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,030
to fight right away the Amir literary I

128
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:55,810
mean these matrices of fallen forms it

129
00:07:52,030 --> 00:08:00,429
can be divided in four parts the left

130
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:03,130
top two by two matrices right top left

131
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:06,540
button and the right button there we can

132
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:15,940
see that all always four part is Samet

133
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:18,370
somatic so to keep G a military that is

134
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,490
G square equals to identity matrix the

135
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:25,510
four parameters have to satisfy these

136
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:28,390
two equations and this let's calibrate

137
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:31,560
caution will decrease the number of

138
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:34,780
parameters from four to three and

139
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,409
furthermore we our goal is to find new

140
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,970
military I mean the estimate metrics

141
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:44,228
such as lat it's Derek

142
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:46,960
directx to account is small and by some

143
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:50,740
the to deduction we get a solution which

144
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:55,540
minimize it at least four and we apply

145
00:08:50,740 --> 00:09:03,100
FOIAs algorithm to it and its SLP xor

146
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:06,520
gate is eighty battlin crowns the

147
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:10,570
previous result motivates us to consider

148
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:14,350
a more generalized form of list we only

149
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:19,870
fix the time diagonal some matrix to

150
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:26,200
identity matrix while the others are to

151
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:30,720
be selected and we also fix the matrices

152
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:35,890
matrix of a to be a companion matrix of

153
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:40,900
opponent polynomial x - 8 + x - 2 + 1

154
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:49,449
drop list form we choose it because its

155
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:52,620
type is XO account is just 1 and without

156
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:57,940
loss of generality we can do some

157
00:09:52,620 --> 00:10:01,450
operations on kilometers well the

158
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:04,660
cooperation won't change the number of

159
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:10,390
parameters is still chaff but in next

160
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:13,949
step we use in military property and

161
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:17,650
reduce it to the list form and the

162
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:21,370
number of parameters is 6 that is

163
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:30,790
epsilon 1 2 epsilon 1 epsilon 1 4 and

164
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:34,330
rst under this limitation we inspect all

165
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:36,880
the parameters in engineering of

166
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:42,490
dimension 6 satisfying the following

167
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:47,260
conditions after

168
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:49,660
ah Steve search we identify 5550 in

169
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:53,880
military emergencies whose Hamming

170
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:59,500
weight are within a range from 148 to

171
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:09,670
172 that is Tax Director actual account

172
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:11,380
within a range of 116 to 114 and now we

173
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,740
consider the depths of the

174
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:17,709
implementation circuits here is a easy

175
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:22,180
example to list two implementations of

176
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:27,939
is all the same summation y 1 plus y 2

177
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:32,579
plus y 3 y 1 it will first is a

178
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:36,520
summation of first four variables y y 3

179
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:41,380
equals the last four variables some a

180
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:50,410
summation and left the depth of left

181
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:53,740
circuit is 4 while the right is 5 so so

182
00:11:50,410 --> 00:12:00,149
it's the importance of the sequence

183
00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:00,149
easing so it was sequence is important

184
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:12,070
as we said we get 5550 M Lea's matrix in

185
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:15,130
the third section and we apply all we

186
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:18,310
apply boyss SLPs heuristic algorithm to

187
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:21,850
all matrices and we found the

188
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:28,029
implementation depth is or is all not

189
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:29,709
all no not last landfall so but a yes

190
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:31,930
mix columns can be implemented with

191
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:35,349
depth of three so we wonder if our

192
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:38,140
matrices can be implemented with depth

193
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,990
know that no bigger than three and we

194
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:46,510
have lists or theorem let's rocket taps

195
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:49,089
often MDS majestic matrix a in 32 past

196
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:53,400
32 which brand number 5 is at least 3

197
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:55,860
it's it's ritual

198
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:01,380
detection but we just counting the

199
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:04,170
number of one in matrix so we try to

200
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:07,470
enhance voice algorithm with depth

201
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:16,530
awareness the difference is in the

202
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:18,900
choice of distance function basically we

203
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:21,480
modify boyss algorithm by only picking

204
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:24,240
signals which are not going to exceed a

205
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,120
specified depth of taps bound and

206
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,550
defining a new notion of distance which

207
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:35,190
takes the socket the socket depth into

208
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:38,219
account we are giving some examples

209
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:42,300
first we denote as as the sequence of

210
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:45,810
signals F as linear predicate and third

211
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:50,189
hsf as our new distance function there

212
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:54,359
is SF as FOIAs distant function if third

213
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:57,330
edge s F equals K F not only can be

214
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,330
obtained obtained by K additions but

215
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:05,240
also have implementation of K additions

216
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,240
with in-depth strength it's indexed edge

217
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,990
the first thing example we have the

218
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:16,229
input signal of five variables and the

219
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:20,700
linear predicate is estimation of how

220
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:25,590
variables then the third edge the third

221
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:31,380
3sf equals Delta s F equals four because

222
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:38,640
it can be implemented as first x2 plus

223
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:42,870
x3 x4 plus x5 and the x6 + X X Devon now

224
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:46,650
we get the estimation of x2 x3 x4 and x5

225
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:50,310
the last step is x8 + x1 this

226
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:54,090
contributes to depths 3 y if is that the

227
00:14:50,310 --> 00:15:00,020
depth lamentation - too nice it has no

228
00:14:54,090 --> 00:15:04,940
solution that means all more all

229
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:11,930
operations contribute to F have

230
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:14,270
no not less than three and the second

231
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:18,260
second example we have more two more

232
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:22,310
where variables X 6 and X 7 X 6 has

233
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:27,710
depth it tab stack 6 is 1 and the depth

234
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:32,989
of X 7 is 2 now we we have to compute to

235
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:38,870
the summation of X 2 plus X 2 X 3 X 4

236
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:42,320
and X 5 by Boyer's algorithm the dirt SF

237
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:49,460
in this step it equals 1 because it can

238
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:54,950
be implemented at X 5 plus X 7 now

239
00:15:49,460 --> 00:16:01,250
equals x 3 plus X 5 plus X 6 equals x2

240
00:15:54,950 --> 00:16:03,470
plus x3 plus x4 plus x5 equals 2f well

241
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:07,790
if we start at the apps limitation the

242
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:11,270
to nightkin can be also implemented

243
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:17,810
within implemented we as we first in

244
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:26,810
computer x 8 equals x 3 plus x5 then x 8

245
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:29,119
+ x6 this is the F so we apply our new

246
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:31,550
algorithm to all matrices with

247
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,980
generating such in second story and the

248
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:38,930
lightest one with depth 3 is restful

249
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:44,630
Yola a is still companion matrix of

250
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:53,540
exponent Gnomeo X X tulip 8 + X - 2 + 1

251
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:57,260
and it's XOR gates is 88 now we are give

252
00:16:53,540 --> 00:17:00,439
our main results we use our new

253
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:08,900
algorithm to the AES mix column matrix

254
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:13,990
and get the XOR gate of 105 105 and the

255
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:16,970
depth limitation of 3 and we also can't

256
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:21,740
construct it too

257
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:23,810
in military MDS matrix one is one has

258
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:28,970
actual gate of 78

259
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:35,810
we steps four and one the other with XOR

260
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:38,090
gate 88 and depth three of our code and

261
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,060
the results are available at our github

262
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:44,300
website

263
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:48,679
in conclusion we constructed a large

264
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:52,760
number of imagery MDS matrices apply boy

265
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:55,700
SLP heuristic algorithm to our matrices

266
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,370
and we get to the lightest military MDS

267
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,040
matrix

268
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:03,709
at last we modify bias the algorithm and

269
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,790
apply the new algorithm to all matrices

270
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:12,560
we get largest in rotary and B as matrix

271
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:22,810
with depth of three it's all and thank

272
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:22,810
you thank you very much any questions

273
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,700
okay so maybe I ask a first question do

274
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:35,710
you think your results can be further

275
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,710
improved or this is best possible

276
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:48,670
constructed more new structures because

277
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,670
we already limited our structure to

278
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:57,010
torus forms but it can be made me have

279
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,010
more structures not left aligned

280
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,940
maybe it's another question I have a

281
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,970
step may be difficult to answer but the

282
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,800
previous talk was also about MDS

283
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,530
matrices with lightweight circuits but

284
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:14,440
they're not involute or e yes so how big

285
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:16,639
is the price to pay to get involute or e

286
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,080
did you get a chance to compare your

287
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,870
results with the ones in the previous

288
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:24,590
paper I mean how much more or Xers do I

289
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:26,030
need to get an involute or a matrix it's

290
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,929
a difference very big or is it water

291
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,180
small yes

292
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:35,130
[Music]

293
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:37,660
we think the military's better for

294
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:44,070
metaphor ciphers binder for division

295
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:47,640
layers okay there any more questions

296
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:53,220
so if not thank you very much Jen

297
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,220
[Applause]
