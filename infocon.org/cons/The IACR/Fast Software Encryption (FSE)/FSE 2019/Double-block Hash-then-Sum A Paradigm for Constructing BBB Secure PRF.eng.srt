1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:10,530
so the next talk is debate blog hashes

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:15,360
and some at paradigm for constructing

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:18,509
beyond does the band secure prf by Neil

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,669
and John data AVG tuta Mehadrin Dungey

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,369
and guten poll and the talk is given by

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,840
a wider

7
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:36,140
thank you for introduction trying to

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:38,760
work with so I will first briefly recall

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,110
the classical symmetric-key story which

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,910
is very common to all of you just recall

11
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,489
the set up so this is a symmetric case

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,760
set up so we have Alice and Bob whose

13
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,199
share the same key and there might be

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,110
another questions who is the adversary

15
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,539
and who can intercept and not only that

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,809
you can intercept he can also

17
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:04,019
manipulates the communications so

18
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:07,020
authentications is our main goal here so

19
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,630
in that case like Alice computes attack

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,210
from the message and also the secret key

21
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,158
and Bob actually Sri Compu is the same

22
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,280
thing we composite app and verifies

23
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:22,860
whether these are same or not so that is

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,740
the way the authentication works and in

25
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:30,090
case of the forgery security so the goal

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:34,560
should be that the adversary here cannot

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,970
modify the message cannot modify the

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,850
message without forging a new and

29
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,890
character so essentially if should not

30
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,360
produce a new should not be able to

31
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,100
produce a new message and takbeer so

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,750
that's us security came for the

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,250
authentications the question is now in

34
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,540
terms of that versus point of view how

35
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,310
the adversary can force so before we

36
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,649
before we define the force you shouldn't

37
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,780
we should model like what is the power

38
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,180
of the adversary and or definitely the

39
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,220
goal goal is the 4G so let's look at the

40
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,629
power of that virtually so adversary can

41
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,720
make several queries

42
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,679
okay so several queries to the Mac

43
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,220
Oracle

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,610
that means he can get a different tax

45
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:24,540
for different messages in his own -

46
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:26,370
exactly as adaptively and also he can

47
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,629
make the verification vertical queries

48
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:33,329
so he can generate a new my new message

49
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:35,970
back here and ask the verifying rascal

50
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:38,549
here is Bob with the peripherals and he

51
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,739
can get a response so that this peer is

52
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:44,010
valid or not so that might be useful so

53
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,390
so adversity has this to rectals today

54
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,929
encryption Oracle and the verification

55
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,730
righto

56
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:52,769
and at the end the if should produce em

57
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,470
a message and tag bell which should

58
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:58,890
should not happen as seen in the map

59
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:04,859
queries so that's the virtual security

60
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:07,349
game and let's look at simple examples

61
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:09,540
when we have about the bound security so

62
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:13,619
this is the ECBC mode so where we have a

63
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,620
CBC before the last call so we have a

64
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:20,099
CBC Mac until the last fall and then we

65
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,540
apply in the one more block cipher with

66
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,540
their independent keys so this is

67
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,328
encrypted CBC Mac there are several

68
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,840
variants of this just let us focus in

69
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,760
this so what what adversary will okay so

70
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,690
that's before let's see some properties

71
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,849
of this CBC Mac so if you look at that

72
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,290
if you have a partitions here if the T

73
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:42,290
values collide for two different masses

74
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,060
and because the block cipher is

75
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:48,358
permutations that means relies on the

76
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,370
Sigma values that means that musicalized

77
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:52,169
on the CBC Mac console so the collision

78
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,930
on the CBC Mac is equivalent to

79
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:58,230
collision and the CBC Mac and that gives

80
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,930
a expansion that gives an expansion

81
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,910
property that means so if you now have

82
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,549
apparitions then you know if we add any

83
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,769
extra blocks say C then you still have a

84
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:10,919
malicious okay so that's called the

85
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:12,530
expansion property of the MSE back so

86
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,819
then most of the sequential map

87
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,510
satisfies this expansion property and

88
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:20,849
and that could be used to explore that

89
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,659
could be used to get an add up once you

90
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:25,700
have a positions

91
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,590
okay so let's see how this can be a daxo

92
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,200
adversary can make several Mac queries

93
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,570
and hoping for collisions and in the

94
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,090
pure and butter bound at versary will

95
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,820
get apparitions the success probability

96
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:40,039
of the collision will be the number of

97
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,260
TAC queries the square of the number of

98
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:47,570
pathways divided by 2 point n where n is

99
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:49,550
the size of the tab once adversary got

100
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,710
the positions say converse about the

101
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,810
positions for M and M prime era might be

102
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,870
like a Mac of I except is same as Mac of

103
00:04:53,810 --> 00:05:00,380
I reject so that means if I add any

104
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,730
extra block after that we will have a

105
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:07,450
collisions because of the expansion

106
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:09,380
property so sabab we say let's see

107
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,390
abstract communication like Bob is

108
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,409
asking ellipse what is my what is your

109
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:17,690
review and so if said ok so you should

110
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:20,450
response or review so Alice is now said

111
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:23,140
ok I accept your paper but we already

112
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:27,950
have seen that as I accept is I reject

113
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:29,479
so with the same tag T for the I accept

114
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,390
your paper doll this is the message and

115
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:36,260
the same duck T will be valid tab for I

116
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:39,200
reject your paper okay so that least Eve

117
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:42,770
actually generates a new message digital

118
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,960
paper paper with this palette that T so

119
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,630
this is this is a forging attack and

120
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,469
that requires a collisions and that is

121
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:55,760
about the bomb so essentially the number

122
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:58,490
of queries is about the bound and our

123
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,770
primary focus of this talk will be how

124
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,320
we can achieve we want but the bond

125
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:06,469
security

126
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,960
okay so let's see what happens in the

127
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,360
path the bound security like if you fix

128
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,180
a southern is to power minus 10 is like

129
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,300
your forgery advantage say and if you

130
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,710
take as a small block like a 64 big

131
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,650
block self ferocity cable with daggers

132
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,690
and take the L is to first 16 L is the

133
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,000
number of blocks of the message so that

134
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:29,420
sometimes effects on collision

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,480
probability which actually does for the

136
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:35,060
pea patch so there are known security

137
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,149
pound for e CB CB CLP math so you see BC

138
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,909
has a but the

139
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:42,709
without the L factor or P map we have a

140
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:45,959
L factor and if you compute this bound

141
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:48,059
if you plug those values in and this

142
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:50,699
bound you get that the number of queries

143
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:54,240
should be at most to 425 for a CBC and B

144
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:57,270
Mac it should be to 480 so that means

145
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,580
the button on security if you have

146
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,709
multiple security your query limit or

147
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,020
your data limit is very low so it's

148
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:11,009
better if you have a b1 but the bound

149
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:12,808
security okay so so far we consider the

150
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,339
for Jerry game of the map which

151
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:17,099
considered but the one forgery of the

152
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:20,339
ECBC map and we see that the butter bomb

153
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:23,188
is so it's it gives too much limitation

154
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:26,039
so it's better if you have something you

155
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:27,599
want multiple so now we will see how we

156
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:29,029
can get a beyond but the boundary your

157
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,050
map

158
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:33,689
okay so there are some known

159
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:36,659
constructions already so for example if

160
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:39,719
you've got some ECBC but it's a sudha in

161
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:41,550
city RSA 2010 so it's just two copies of

162
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:43,589
ECB so you have a one in CBC you have

163
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,409
only this in the ICBC up to here so in a

164
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:48,539
1 and K 2 so this is this is one ECBC

165
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:50,339
map and you have another a CBC Mac

166
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:53,068
applied to the same message but the two

167
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:55,249
different is k3 and k4 and then you sum

168
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:58,829
it so that the name stands for the

169
00:07:55,249 --> 00:08:01,829
designs of some ECBC this is definitely

170
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:03,959
not efficient for the rate is half okay

171
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:06,749
and it requires 4 independent rock

172
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:09,360
cipher keys and security is proven like

173
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:10,679
to go to port 2 and so it's now it's

174
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,990
about gone but the bound security

175
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:14,518
because you see the you get that you

176
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,139
want to quote to end if you ignored the

177
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,679
factor L so it's not about the bound

178
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:21,089
security there are other constructions

179
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:25,078
in April 2011

180
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:26,699
Yasuda and he actually modifies the PMAG

181
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:29,039
construction so if you look at the top

182
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,389
layers so you get a pee Mak but you have

183
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,870
a bottom layers which is the linear

184
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:36,329
combinations of the the chaining values

185
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:38,188
and then you apply this to any cases so

186
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:41,039
up to this point is like a pee Mak and

187
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:43,828
then we have another computations and

188
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,500
you get so this is a very simple small

189
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:49,130
overhead over P map which actually gives

190
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:53,820
a bi p on but the bond security

191
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:56,640
and there is another constructions 3 KF

192
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,640
9 which is defined over cbc-mac so you

193
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,170
see that we have older men but the bond

194
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,580
construction and on top of that you can

195
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,670
design your blue but the ball security

196
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,560
with a little over it so you have a X

197
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,870
you just what you have to do this is the

198
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,410
cbc-mac values or ECBC max area actually

199
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:16,590
and then you XOR with the changing

200
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,939
values and apply another keys apply the

201
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,370
block cipher with another independent

202
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,610
keys and then you get a final tag so

203
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:26,040
they have proof the Securities Q value

204
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,840
or too poor to n but I found this I

205
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,730
found this proof is wrong actually so

206
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,190
you do not get a but the possibility in

207
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,870
terms of the L you sorry on about the

208
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,780
bond security in terms of the else it

209
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,910
should be L power 4 so this bound is not

210
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,800
correct but that's a different issue is

211
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:44,100
just when you look at the different

212
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,140
constructions with a similar Budda Budda

213
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,500
p on but the bounce ability we found

214
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:52,650
some flaw in the proprio and there are

215
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:56,280
other constructions like map + bi nitro

216
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:58,890
in a single 2017 and there you have you

217
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,079
have a light map on top and then you

218
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:04,170
have a I guess same idea applies the

219
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,540
pmab + and we got a light man class and

220
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:10,229
here you don't know how l factor as like

221
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:15,030
L like math but we have now bought the

222
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:16,800
body okay so so far we see the known

223
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,449
constructions which achieves the beyond

224
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,599
but the bound constructions but all of

225
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:24,210
these constructions has three keys so

226
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,520
and there and and this here the similar

227
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,080
design principles so that's we now see

228
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,020
like what are the design principles and

229
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,990
we use that to unify all these designs

230
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,850
have a unified proof and that also not

231
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,370
only it does it not only unifies the do

232
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,410
all the construction also but it also

233
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:45,540
gives a higher security in the sense of

234
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:48,510
the higher power for maybe in terms of

235
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:52,140
the L or sometimes in terms of Q so

236
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,819
let's see so so we have these three heat

237
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,680
constructions this is the unified view

238
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,960
of all these constructions we apply the

239
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,579
hash function some hash functions it

240
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,220
will get to tour the Sigma and theta and

241
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,730
then we have a some processor post post

242
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,930
position

243
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:09,270
some functions i'ma play that and I know

244
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,219
some it and we got the death so this is

245
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,620
like you have our double block hash and

246
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,730
then you have play some functions so if

247
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,170
you have a so and here you have a three

248
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,850
is because we consider this as

249
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,490
independent E and all this construction

250
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,680
actually have an independent keys and

251
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,920
maybe four keys for in case of the ECBC

252
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,989
because here they have poopies but you

253
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,719
can make it two case if you have a same

254
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,820
block cipher here okay so that can save

255
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,770
one more one key step three you can have

256
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,720
a two piece and even further you can

257
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,810
make it single did if you if you use the

258
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,120
same key here so so there are different

259
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,829
variants of this type this paradigm the

260
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,820
coolest politic our block has then some

261
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:53,550
and for all this construction we can

262
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,470
prove this ability if we have a security

263
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,810
of the if you have a PRF security of

264
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,730
this some functions so if the some

265
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,739
functions becomes is a PRF then you can

266
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,740
apply the well-known has then PRF and we

267
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,720
can get a pure if Mac security but

268
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:10,980
unfortunately the some function is not a

269
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:15,060
PRF and it is easy to see this for

270
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:17,280
queries to the some functions so the

271
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,560
first two queries we have us the first

272
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,610
block are same and third and fourth

273
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,589
queries we have the first blocks are

274
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,810
same and first and third we have a

275
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,490
second blocks are same and second and

276
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,619
fourth we have second blocks are same so

277
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:31,800
that means each block is used exactly

278
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,680
twice so now if you observe these are

279
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,510
four outputs and if you XOR it because

280
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,959
it's each block appeared exactly twice

281
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:42,180
so it cancels each other and you get 0

282
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,830
so just by making for queries you can

283
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:48,000
distinguish the sum function so sum

284
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:50,550
function is not clearly appearing so if

285
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,650
you graphically represent this peer the

286
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:56,180
previous attack what we actually have is

287
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,180
like authentic cycle

288
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:02,440
will mean that we have a equality's on

289
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,270
the first block and the blue dotted edge

290
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,450
will mean the equality's on the second

291
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:09,430
block so what we actually have in these

292
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,320
four queries that we have alternating

293
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,329
cycles so we have a red edge here we

294
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,420
have a radius here and the blue edge in

295
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,160
this tool okay so if you have this type

296
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,110
of monitoring cycle not even for the

297
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,990
full length you can have a alterna cycle

298
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,339
of length 2 that means vocalize which is

299
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,649
not possible you know when we analyze

300
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:30,040
the PRF but it might be possible that

301
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:32,260
the inputs might collide if the hash if

302
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,240
the input is the output of the hash

303
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,880
function they may collide and that can

304
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,620
give two alternating cycles and this is

305
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,390
a full alternating cycle instead of six

306
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:44,529
alternate inside but any length of

307
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:49,120
alternating cycle will lead to this so

308
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:50,500
we have to avoid that so so to avoid

309
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,010
these type of alternating cycles what

310
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:57,130
will consider some alternate paths a of

311
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:59,980
h2 or is number of edges can be 2 or 3

312
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,450
so let us consider the alternate path to

313
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,910
that actually simplifies the analysis

314
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:07,390
the analysis of the alternating cycles a

315
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:10,529
bit more cumbersome so to avoid those we

316
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:13,449
actually consider the alternative path

317
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:15,870
ok so now we'll focus on the disability

318
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,400
of this mode this is a unified mode

319
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:20,290
we'll just briefly discuss what are the

320
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,770
main bad events and you will see the

321
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,719
details in the papers ok so we have

322
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,839
different Sigma values and theta values

323
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,660
if you very different messages ok and we

324
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,540
say that this Sigma couple and 3 data

325
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,760
per is forward if we have a say

326
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,860
alternating cycles of length 2 that we

327
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,120
have to avoid for two different messages

328
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,660
here we have a polishes on the hash

329
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,740
values okay all alternate paths of

330
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,140
length 3 means we'll have a 2 edges

331
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,209
Sigma equal to Sigma J and theta equal

332
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:53,050
to theta K so that's not any part of

333
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:55,149
length 3 so you can easily see that if

334
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,890
if you do not have these two conditions

335
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:58,930
then there cannot be any alternating

336
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,490
cycles because authentic cycle of length

337
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:04,810
4 or 6 or higher

338
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:07,029
most wanting a b3 okay so it's just to

339
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:09,910
ease the analysis people may consider

340
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:11,830
the AC 4 or maybe

341
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,300
you get a possibly get a better bounce

342
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,640
that if you want to prove the better

343
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,189
bound probably you have to go for that

344
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,350
but for if you restrict if you restrict

345
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,180
your bat event like this then you the

346
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:26,700
energy analysis is much simpler and you

347
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:30,900
can actually get the same bound as the

348
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:34,000
the designers proof originally okay so

349
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,920
so we already just seem that our recycle

350
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,080
makes the sum to be zero so you should

351
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,300
avoid it so the one bad event is

352
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,470
definitely the about n cycle to as I

353
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:46,660
mentioned the another bad event is a p3

354
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:48,850
okay so so these are the different bad

355
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,449
events which appear in the proof okay

356
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:54,160
and that actually appoints all the

357
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,380
training cycles these to avoid all that

358
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:03,640
reading cycles but there will be some

359
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:06,670
more bad events when you prove this have

360
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,620
some more events so why those bad the

361
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,750
others bad events are coming this is

362
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,400
like what we do in the ideal world you

363
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,030
know I don't know what we sample the TI

364
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,920
values

365
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:17,770
randomly so all the TI y values which is

366
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:20,380
a tag we sample randomly and then we

367
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:22,510
sample the hash key and we see observe

368
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,270
the different Sigma and theatres based

369
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:27,700
on hash key and all the queries are done

370
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:31,420
so we have a different Sigma and theta

371
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:34,780
values and we have a TI values suppose

372
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:39,400
we have a cell Sigma equal to Sigma J

373
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:41,140
for some hoops for two queries okay so

374
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,319
what we'll do is sample one of this

375
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:46,030
suppose your sample Sigma J hat then we

376
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,860
have to give the same Sigma J hat here

377
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:51,220
Sigma I had should be Sigma J hat

378
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:53,650
because the inputs collide here but once

379
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,260
you fix Sigma J hat to be here then the

380
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:59,560
theta hat theta I had which should be TI

381
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:04,030
plus Sigma and so this value is kind of

382
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:05,619
fixed is you cannot you cannot some you

383
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,810
cannot have there is no randomness once

384
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:12,879
you have a once you fix all the T values

385
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:16,119
and the Sigma and this can happen this

386
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,760
can collide for the previous sum another

387
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:21,520
theta K hat hands so this theta high hat

388
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,510
which is assigned because of you are

389
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,359
trying to

390
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:27,579
make it comfortable with your previously

391
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,039
sample T values and which can collide

392
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:33,070
with the already sample theta values and

393
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:35,379
that can be a problem because theta I

394
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:37,600
may not be equal to theta T and you got

395
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,190
a position on the range but there is no

396
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,719
polish on the domain so that's for the

397
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,640
range permission so we've got a range

398
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,590
for itself so previously like all these

399
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,740
previous positions was like a domain

400
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,090
polishes the KC to be three but now you

401
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,440
have some kind of range position because

402
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:53,529
this is the block ciphers we have to

403
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,390
avoid both range and domain position so

404
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:57,190
this is the expression one and similarly

405
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:00,610
you have an edge version two is just the

406
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:02,350
opposite like instead of getting a

407
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:08,770
position on theta now we've got a

408
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:12,250
position on the Sigma D hat okay so we

409
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:14,049
define the bad we say that we are bad

410
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,360
even means all these collisions Ridge

411
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:20,260
collisions and the previous that a p3

412
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:22,750
and a c2 and then you can bound the

413
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:26,559
range positions like three possible

414
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:28,600
topple i JK which can we can choose in

415
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,000
the hue boys you choose three arrays in

416
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,830
particularly and the probability for

417
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,330
this like a range position you go to

418
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:38,020
pour in and there will be one more

419
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:40,240
positions because of the you do this

420
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,220
range position once you have a Sigma

421
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,140
equal to Sigma J or theta equal to theta

422
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,059
J so once you have a position here that

423
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,950
that is the position property of the

424
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:50,918
hash functions because it Universal hash

425
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:52,240
function advantage and we have a dude

426
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,970
randomness so the T we have another

427
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,450
positions to see da that cost to power

428
00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:00,490
minus n here so you actually get to port

429
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:03,490
to n if you assume that Universal has

430
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:07,059
advantages to power minus a so you get a

431
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:09,730
Nuke over 2 / 2 n bound here and we have

432
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:12,129
the free or the other bounds like a this

433
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,169
is the AC to or ending cycle of length 2

434
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:17,230
this is actually the position of the

435
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:19,480
hash function out both all twin without

436
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,640
booze so we may expect to port 2 n 1

437
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,340
over 2 power 2 n here oh and this is the

438
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:28,600
power 3 advantage which is like a p3 so

439
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:30,939
here because of the possibly independent

440
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,590
of the hash outputs or using the

441
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,600
dedicated constructor

442
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:39,789
you can get a 1 over 2 power 2 n power

443
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:43,330
here so in total you actually get to

444
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:44,860
part 2 n q 2 or 2 / 12 but it's still

445
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,689
not done we have to do some more good

446
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,519
transcript analysis and for that we use

447
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:52,960
the sum of permutation results by looks

448
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:56,889
YouTube mm okay so what we get at the

449
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,499
end we get the PRF advantage is persist

450
00:19:56,889 --> 00:20:02,769
up these four thumbs so one is the power

451
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:07,389
three terms one is the AC 2 terms other

452
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:10,600
is this is due to range whether they do

453
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:12,070
change position and this is due to the

454
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,959
good transmit analysis you have to

455
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,939
consider some of permutation rather you

456
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,629
get this term due to good good

457
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:22,360
transmittances so this is the bound you

458
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:23,799
can get the details of how actually

459
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,110
these bounds are coming and we apply the

460
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:28,619
edge technique proof you can get to all

461
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:31,539
the details in the proof and the tip

462
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:33,879
okay so now I move to two key

463
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:35,919
constructions the two key construction

464
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:37,809
is similar to the three key construction

465
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,110
but you'll have now same key

466
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:43,259
it's the problem theory in this case you

467
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,428
have to have a more bad events like you

468
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:47,649
previously I consider X Sigma equal to

469
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:49,119
Sigma J or theta equal to theta K but

470
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:51,610
you have to now you have to consider

471
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:55,240
post collisions X Sigma equal to theta K

472
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,799
or theta equal to Sigma J so this this

473
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,929
cross collisions are coming and that

474
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,950
makes the analysis much more cumbersome

475
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:07,059
so what we did we we apply some fix to

476
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:09,820
learn fix one so this means we fix one

477
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:10,779
bit to zero of the hash output and fixed

478
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,749
one means we fix

479
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:16,119
say last bit to one so that means I

480
00:21:13,749 --> 00:21:18,340
never get a position between Sigma and

481
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:20,709
between one signify look with AR the

482
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:23,379
theta values because the last bit is

483
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:26,019
fixed so that actually is the trick to

484
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:28,709
avoid the unnecessary extra variables

485
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:33,730
which can arise for the two key analysis

486
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:36,879
okay so so this is this actually gives

487
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:40,990
us two key step to Teague analysis two

488
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:43,240
key has been some analysis but here you

489
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,510
have to be careful because the we have a

490
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,370
universal advantage as well as the

491
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,990
condition advantage for the hash

492
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,310
functions but the hash function is no

493
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:54,330
longer this hash function should be

494
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:55,950
after fix doodle fix one okay so so the

495
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,240
overhead actually comes into the

496
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,400
analysis of the hash function but still

497
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,980
it's better because you only consider a

498
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,050
pair of message or it three messages and

499
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:09,750
you consider some polish an event on

500
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:11,760
Sigma and theta okay so in that case we

501
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,590
get a similar results for the two key

502
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,400
constructions which fix you that fix one

503
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:19,860
we get similar thumbs you will get some

504
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,350
extra time you over to pour in and these

505
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:25,080
terms again you do the sum of conversion

506
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:27,149
results but now it's not for some of our

507
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,010
mutations with the same two independent

508
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,380
keys but some function with assembly so

509
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:33,150
so there are some variants of the

510
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,140
pattern scissors also so where you can

511
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,480
apply that and you get a different

512
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,970
factors like six cube over to for 2n and

513
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:45,480
using that you will get a two key

514
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:47,580
analysis okay okay so let's see some

515
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,240
instantiation and what what happens our

516
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:54,210
bound if we apply this analysis so we

517
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,480
already have a some a CBC P map plus 3 k

518
00:22:54,210 --> 00:23:01,110
f9 like met last all these are three key

519
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:03,300
so these are the old bound and we if you

520
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,510
see after the new if you get to see the

521
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:10,080
new bounds and so we actually get some

522
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:11,570
improved bound for example some ECBC we

523
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,000
don't have l factor here

524
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:17,639
so but we have a QL square which which

525
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,070
is income if you square it you get

526
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,860
accused by L 4 over 2 power 2 n in any

527
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:25,260
way cubic L for two-port well so in some

528
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:30,030
sense it's a better bound than this in

529
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:32,190
Sam sees this is more or less even this

530
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,810
is better also so we don't have a lq

531
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:37,320
factor here so we've mostly gained in

532
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:39,870
terms of the l factors so we have a

533
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,659
premium plus bound which is improved the

534
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:45,449
3 k f9 which is which is not correct as

535
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:48,240
I mentioned there should be L 4 so I

536
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:51,150
found very difficult to avoid the but

537
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,860
the bound of L so in the sequencer

538
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:56,790
constructions the birth the bound of L

539
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:58,979
is becomes unavoidable so this is not a

540
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:02,549
correct so what were the bound we got is

541
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,130
well for what refer to it and like map

542
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:08,580
plus okay this is already typed so there

543
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:10,440
is nothing to improve but at the same

544
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,210
time we actually have two key versions

545
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,970
of all these constructions with a

546
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:17,640
similar about so the previous all these

547
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,770
constructions are three keys or maybe

548
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,450
forties but now you have a two key

549
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:24,900
versions of all these constructions and

550
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:27,770
you get a similar bomb so this means you

551
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:31,260
say please okay you get a better bounds

552
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:33,690
so the advantage of you sometimes you

553
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,340
get advantage if unify the designs if

554
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,890
you have a better understanding of the

555
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:41,070
designs so a better analysis on the and

556
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:44,880
on those designs and we get a better

557
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,409
powers so we have shown the security of

558
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,990
all this construction after to put two

559
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:52,470
in by three as I mentioned like we

560
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:54,600
consider the two bad events recap the

561
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:58,559
path of length three with the two edges

562
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:02,189
so one may actually go for the three AP

563
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,860
for one can hope for better security and

564
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,840
that's what I are we believe in fact

565
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:10,799
there are attacks known in give last

566
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:13,740
tiptoed it will have shown that all

567
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,629
these constructions can be attacked into

568
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,059
position by Qualicum TN by full query

569
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,740
complexity so the true position by poor

570
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:21,928
is the upper bound on the number of

571
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,280
queries you cannot better than that and

572
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:24,600
we already have a lower bound on the

573
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,760
number of queries used to power 2 n by

574
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,280
three so there is still a gap which is

575
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,190
an open problem and we believe that the

576
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:35,460
gap can be pushed for that to 2 / 3 n by

577
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:38,309
4 if you consider that possibly the AP

578
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,500
poor and some other bad events might be

579
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:42,780
so we have not done this those analysis

580
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,000
because it looks more cumbersome or they

581
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,129
do you have a spell bad evil so so we

582
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,130
avoid those bad events but we hope that

583
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:52,370
this can be met tight to 2 per chain by

584
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,370
4

585
00:25:53,310 --> 00:26:07,230
[Applause]

586
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:08,700
questions for my daughter yes so we have

587
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:13,860
a brief question could you go back one

588
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:16,380
slide so for three kf9 and so you said

589
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,969
that you have cute cube out to the four

590
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,710
and they have Q cube out to the third

591
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,600
and that's why their result is incorrect

592
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:24,600
but could it just as well be that your

593
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:28,219
bound is slightly worse or is it really

594
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,219
a mistake in the proof of tricky f9

595
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:36,000
professor plop okay the proof their

596
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:38,280
proof you will get this but you found a

597
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,700
mistake in the proof yeah okay yes yes

598
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:48,320
okay that's it other questions

599
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,320
well if not let us think I do it again

600
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,620
and the last talk
