1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,910
last talk of decision support

2
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:09,030
cryptanalysis of round reduce skinny the

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,210
adverts our sataek sadeghi terrible

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:15,059
Maddy and NASA Burberry but the otters

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,940
couldn't be here none of them so Hadi is

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,859
gonna present the paper

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:23,039
thanks for introductions was already

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:26,810
mentioned one of the other one wanted to

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,849
come but for some unexpended unexpected

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,439
reason unfortunate she couldn't come and

11
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,380
then very recently I was asked to

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,540
present the paper so actually be a skirt

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,629
in the airport on I was coming so I hope

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,269
that I can cover all of the details but

15
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:46,500
anyway this presentation is about keep

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,960
the reserves of skinny so first I'll

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,579
introduce a brief description of the

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,770
skinny and then I present a new zero

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,129
correlation linear cube tolerances of a

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,780
skinny which is obviously one of the

21
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,030
which is obviously the best zero

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,960
correlation characteristic that has been

23
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:10,530
found for a skinny and then I discuss

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,679
MLP model for a skinny 64 and the

25
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:18,600
searching related to a key and finally I

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:23,310
conclude with the results so yeah it's

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:26,149
good to be the last talk a lot of thing

28
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,670
having to do this by previous talks but

29
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:32,820
skinny was introduced at Kyoto sixteen

30
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,009
it has different variants based on the

31
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,240
length of the block and also the length

32
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,930
of the tweak we have different variant

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,929
that

34
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:54,440
yeah that n denotes black silent is the

35
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,930
twig size and T can be n 12 and 3n and

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:03,030
respectively we call them tk1 tk2 and TK

37
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:09,450
3 version of skin and tomb in religions

38
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:13,410
is when n is 16 and 128 the block size

39
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:17,220
so of course as usual we can like a

40
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:21,660
space AES like cypher we can present the

41
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:25,050
whole state as 4 times 4 square it has

42
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,530
each round has five operations it

43
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:31,019
consists of five operation first we have

44
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:37,170
s poxes s boxes are applied and then we

45
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:39,870
have a drum key and then twig twig key I

46
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,440
got here in the first round and then we

47
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:47,910
have shift oh like abs and we have mix

48
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:56,640
column that is a simple between the sets

49
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:58,859
and the tweak actually the tricky is

50
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,649
updated like this we have a permutation

51
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:08,459
each time it asked the permutation and

52
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:12,359
then up to the first two rows and if TJ

53
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:14,700
and if you have TJ 2 we have also lfsr

54
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:17,280
it means the first we apply permutation

55
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:21,358
and then the first two runs also pass an

56
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:25,350
lfsr and 40k one when the size of the

57
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:29,250
tweak and the size of the block size are

58
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:32,760
equal then we don't have elitism okay

59
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,640
zero correlation linear is already

60
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,798
introduced by previous work so we have a

61
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,720
linear approximation like this and then

62
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,780
for the linear approximation of course

63
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,549
we can consider a probability it means

64
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,420
that the poverty that this term would be

65
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:50,360
equal to 0 and

66
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:53,209
the correlation is twice of the

67
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,180
probability minus one and if the

68
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:57,800
correlation would be exactly zero for a

69
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,780
cipher then we have a distinguished

70
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:05,530
shape of the cipher for a skinny we can

71
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:09,290
simply find a non zero zero correlation

72
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:12,410
characteristic it's depicted here if we

73
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:15,260
have for example one cell active here it

74
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:18,769
means nonzero mask for the input and

75
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,560
another nonzero messages for this then

76
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:24,230
we can simply this that it's not

77
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,900
possible because in the middle for

78
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:30,650
example if you look at the first here

79
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:33,859
and here from one direction it should be

80
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,960
zero the masked in your internal value

81
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,570
of the mass could be zero while here it

82
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,479
should be nonzero so it means that we

83
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:45,650
have a zero correlation characteristic

84
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:51,200
for nitros it's very straightforward to

85
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:54,260
obtain this characteristic so but if you

86
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,849
want to add one more round for example

87
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:00,620
we want to add from backward or forward

88
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:03,290
in the middle of the cipher to have ten

89
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,840
one zero correlation then we can see

90
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:08,030
that there is no contradiction so if we

91
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,830
compare this assay to this assay there

92
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,080
is no contradiction between the m at

93
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:17,180
first class and what is done in this

94
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:23,270
paper that the others have observed that

95
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:25,130
if we consider these two cells and they

96
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,010
should be zero mass they should have

97
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:31,460
zero masks and if we go to the details

98
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:33,560
of the runs then we see that okay if we

99
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,260
don't want to have a contradiction then

100
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,419
they should be zero and after the shift

101
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,219
row they are in the same X column in the

102
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:44,419
same column and after applying mix

103
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:47,180
column then this should be nonzero value

104
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:50,240
and if we compare this state to this set

105
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:53,419
this is safe then we can see there is a

106
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,600
contradiction so by this nice trick we

107
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,669
can extend

108
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,880
correlation will nonzero correlation for

109
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:02,730
the skinny for one round and then the

110
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,490
others utilized this zero correlation

111
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,770
characteristics to apply key recovery

112
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:14,550
attack on skinny for different revisions

113
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:20,580
and they could actually attack 14 and 18

114
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:24,590
ones for these wedges in what follows I

115
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:28,500
focus on impossible related to key

116
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:32,219
impossible differential first let me

117
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,980
recall the using my LP model for finding

118
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:40,680
impossible differential characteristics

119
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:44,580
or at 2011 by Mahon others is shown that

120
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,530
the problem finding optimal differential

121
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:50,729
characteristic or linear approximation

122
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:55,530
linear trade can be actually converted

123
00:06:50,730 --> 00:07:00,170
to the optimization problem model in in

124
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:02,789
M ILP and in M ILP we have a set of

125
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,730
inequality and also we have a function

126
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:08,970
that we want to have find the solution

127
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:14,180
such that this function get minimum

128
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:15,480
value so how we can model finding

129
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,950
impossible

130
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:22,350
differential by M ILP so simple we

131
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:26,580
should consider all of the bits in the

132
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:31,440
before the sbox and after the sbox so we

133
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:36,320
present the sets the bits of the SS

134
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:39,870
before the S part by X 0 to X 63 and

135
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:44,099
similarly the output us why are you here

136
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:46,950
oh - why I 16 and we denote each bit as

137
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,170
0 or 1 if there is no difference in the

138
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:52,320
between them and in between there says

139
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:58,290
on that bit and one if it has the

140
00:07:52,320 --> 00:08:01,830
difference to describe the active or as

141
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:04,440
if s boxes we need consider

142
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,719
another why do you like a.j for any

143
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,889
spark so we have four bit 2-fold bitters

144
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:14,129
boxes and if the S box is active is 1

145
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:17,400
and otherwise it's zero and to have to

146
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:20,099
describe this like a mile people in my

147
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,729
LP model then we have these equations

148
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:26,719
and then we want to have our aim is to

149
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:31,620
find the solution for the minimum of the

150
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:35,070
value of this summation and then what as

151
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,200
usual it is done they consider

152
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:41,820
differential and all of the values that

153
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:47,550
this probability is larger than zero it

154
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:52,130
means that Delta X can go our this back

155
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:54,779
to Delta Y and then of course we can

156
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:59,779
consider instead of considering the

157
00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:04,350
whole space we can they actually

158
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:09,930
computed representation of convex hull

159
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:13,160
with sage map and with respect to X or

160
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:16,500
it's already well-known that it can be

161
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:20,130
modeled by this equation by using

162
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:23,550
another one more actually value a bit

163
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:26,970
like D and a plus B plus C should be

164
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:30,510
equal to 2 D and it's description of a

165
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:33,630
it shall be - C - C and of course we

166
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:36,569
have some kind of impossible events for

167
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:45,089
example ABC cannot be 0 0 1 because 0

168
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:47,640
pixels 0 is not one okay this model for

169
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:52,079
the first time I think it was proposed

170
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:54,720
by Sui to use mi LP model to find

171
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:59,699
impossible differential characteristic

172
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:03,800
or 0 linear a trade but it was

173
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:07,410
applicable on just small small boxes

174
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,170
boxes with a small size and then in

175
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:12,600
follow-up work Sasaki and others

176
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:15,870
proposed another method that

177
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,490
also includes applying it can be

178
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,160
applicable on s-boxes a lot of the

179
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,220
responses like eight times eight the

180
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:29,730
technique is to consider input and

181
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:32,130
output differences fix and Emily search

182
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,550
whether or not there are propagate

183
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,380
propagation from input to output

184
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,620
difference and if it's not possible it's

185
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:44,689
infeasible then it concludes that is

186
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:48,420
it's an impossible characteristics so

187
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:51,030
the others apply the technique on skinny

188
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:54,390
by considering different different

189
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:56,400
scenario you can consider input value or

190
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,439
after this box we can consider this

191
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,370
mistake of course we should we should

192
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:06,690
take into account a Twiggy and we have

193
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:11,130
also output and the results are shown in

194
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:14,660
this table so the best result for a

195
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:20,210
skinny TK one is for thirteen runs and

196
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:32,130
for TK 2 is 15 runs by considering these

197
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:36,440
differences so based on the results that

198
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:39,900
I just showed they could find

199
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,030
characteristic which is one round larger

200
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:46,709
than all of the well-known previous Wars

201
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:52,069
in impossible setting and then it's used

202
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:56,250
to actually it's for example the is the

203
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:58,620
picture of the characteristics that they

204
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:02,150
have found for 13 rounds of a skinny and

205
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:10,850
n we have a contradiction in the middle

206
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:13,560
and it's and also but yeah so the so

207
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,540
maybe the color is not very clear here

208
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,280
so they consider a fixed value here and

209
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,500
a fixed value here and then they show

210
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:23,130
that for 13 rounds over 30 knows it's

211
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:28,890
impossible for 15 euros it's a bit more

212
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:32,010
educated actually they consider this

213
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:36,240
state and what they found is that a bit

214
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:38,790
complicated so M n PQ cannot be any

215
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,790
value it should be actually holes in

216
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:45,300
these equations to have an impossible

217
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:48,329
characteristics and all of the values of

218
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,120
listed here so it means that totally we

219
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:54,630
have 15 different impossible

220
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,100
characteristics but when you fix the

221
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,660
input different stand out with

222
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:02,210
difference cannot be anything on that

223
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:05,670
cell very specific value and of course

224
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:08,880
for Kirika why we have some problem that

225
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:12,349
I will discuss later I will say what

226
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:17,960
they did but then this this fifteen ones

227
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:23,370
used to attack 223 rounds skinny into it

228
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:25,770
so for Q company as usual we have a nice

229
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,960
framework we have impossible

230
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,610
differential in the middle and we had

231
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,450
sometimes in the beginning and some

232
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:36,360
rounds at the end and then we guess the

233
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:38,390
involve key in the last round and the

234
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,400
beginning round and then based on the

235
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:45,840
number of actually the probability of

236
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:49,110
the filtration and from the end and

237
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:53,520
beginning we can compute time complexity

238
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:56,700
of the attack but what I mentioned that

239
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,130
15 rounds can possibly differential

240
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,770
characteristics that has been used is

241
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,820
very specific it means that if you have

242
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:07,800
specific value in the input of the

243
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:10,710
characteristics then the output is very

244
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:15,270
specific value so totally fifteen

245
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:18,270
different values so from forward and

246
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:24,680
backward what they did is that instead

247
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:29,220
of doing this in 15 different parallel

248
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:31,099
methods they consider general structure

249
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,800
and finally they

250
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,500
then whenever they reached this state

251
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,219
like this then they save this value for

252
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,020
the jetski

253
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,790
and then finally they can compare and do

254
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,870
the same for the back wall and then

255
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:51,920
compare when for which specific values

256
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:55,130
they have impossible event and then they

257
00:14:51,920 --> 00:15:00,709
could they can of course eliminate the

258
00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:03,439
wrong key so yeah this is the

259
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:10,580
resourceful key recovery if you look at

260
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:13,790
the results the the time complexity the

261
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,610
time complexity is slightly better than

262
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:19,280
previous and normal attacks but the

263
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:25,580
memory is not really decreased so from 2

264
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:29,300
or 2 to the 124 its decreased to to 278

265
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:35,000
which is notably less than previous one

266
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:41,060
and also from here 56th its decreased to

267
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:45,290
49 and if I can find you here then 112

268
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:49,579
is decreased to 97 so the memory is

269
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:53,030
decreased yeah

270
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:55,190
sorry again if I did not go to the all

271
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,890
of the details actually I didn't have

272
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:06,260
enough time to prepare myself but thank

273
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:10,030
you anyway for your attention so I guess

274
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,030
you'll be willing to answer questions or

275
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,949
a question okay so let's thank the

276
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,949
speaker again

277
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,349
[Applause]
