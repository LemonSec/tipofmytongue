1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
so the next talk is on boomerang

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,000
connectivity table revisited

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,740
applications to skinny and AAS and the

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:18,570
talk is given by link song thank you for

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:22,070
the introduction okay since I use

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:26,000
different notations so I introduced

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:28,109
piranha attacks again the boring attacks

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
combined to show the different

9
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:35,940
software's to get a long distinguished

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,530
it treats the cipher as two subscibers a

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,480
0 and a 1 suppose you one has a

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,440
differential alpha to beta with

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:50,069
probability P and um has it a friendship

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,690
gamma to Delta with probability Q then

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,590
the probability for the boom on

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:58,170
distinguisher

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:01,850
is P squared Q squared that is if we

18
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,110
choose the p1 p2 with difference alpha

19
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,710
encrypting to have the corresponding

20
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:12,270
ciphertext C 1 C 2 and then add the add

21
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:16,289
a data difference to have the new pair

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:20,070
of ciphertext C 3 and C 4 decrypt them

23
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,680
to have the plaintext P 3 and P 4 the

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,529
difference of them will be alpha with

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:31,650
probability P square Q square actually

26
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:34,740
boom run is a throne - it is a setting

27
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,259
in the partners paper that when you send

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,420
it up properly it always comes back to

29
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,810
you

30
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:45,899
however this horse only when the two

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:51,149
trails are independent which are not the

32
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:54,720
case in many applications the dependency

33
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:58,439
is the key issue for boomerang attacks

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,000
as shown before the dependency can help

35
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,579
the attackers

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,619
it can also invalidate the attacks later

37
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:11,480
sandwich attacks were proposed to

38
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:15,540
particularly deal with the dependency

39
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:19,250
the sandwich attack decomposed decipher

40
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:23,130
into three parts the middle part am

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,890
handles the dependency so that the

42
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:29,600
difference of treasures for the rest at

43
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:33,559
two parts is zero till and you wanted

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,700
can be regarded as independent if the

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,790
probabilities for the differential

46
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:43,790
trails over zero tooth and the you want

47
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:45,989
ears Peters and cued respectively the

48
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:50,519
probability for the Brahmin distinguish

49
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:56,280
can be formulated as P tilde square Q

50
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:59,459
square R and the are here is actually

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,450
the probability that the boomerang

52
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:06,959
returns for the e/m in the middle with

53
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:13,410
difference alpha beta here in the gamma

54
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:16,890
here usually a.m. contains a few rounds

55
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:20,130
and in the paper of sandwich attacks a

56
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:24,359
dedicated analysis was carried out to

57
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:26,730
calculate our last year state at all

58
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,420
proposed the boomerang connectivity

59
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:34,018
table which can calculate our

60
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:38,369
theoretically when en is of 1s box layer

61
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:45,510
it can also unify previous observations

62
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:48,859
and the S box however two questions two

63
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:52,858
problems still remain unsolved

64
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:55,940
the first is to identify the active

65
00:03:52,859 --> 00:04:00,200
boundaries of a.m. which contains

66
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:04,049
dependency the second is to calculate R

67
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:08,518
the probability the probability R when

68
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:11,130
a.m. contains multiple rams in this work

69
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,570
we propose that our generalized the

70
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:21,108
framework of a city which enables us to

71
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:23,940
solve these two problems some basics of

72
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:27,830
DDT and obesity

73
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:30,540
DDT records the number of solutions

74
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:34,039
satisfying the differential alpha to

75
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:38,340
beta the differential probability is the

76
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:44,610
DDT entry over 2 to the N where 2 to the

77
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:48,419
n is the size of the input space and B

78
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:53,400
city records the number of solutions

79
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:54,210
that such that the boomerang returns for

80
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,099
the sbox

81
00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:02,580
and the boomerang probability is

82
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:06,180
actually the base city entry over 2 to

83
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:14,130
the N where 2 to the N is also the size

84
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:17,070
of the input space both the B city paper

85
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:21,690
and the previous talk studied the

86
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:25,110
relation between DDT and B city first

87
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:29,250
let's introduce chooses XT DT and why

88
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:32,430
did't e exit DDT is the set of input

89
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:35,580
values satisfying the differential alpha

90
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,190
to beta and the y DD T is the set for

91
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:43,109
the output of values also satisfying the

92
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:45,930
differential our starting point is this

93
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:50,850
proposition from the previous talk it

94
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:55,020
says that the number of imports let us

95
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:59,370
say X 1 without loss of generality such

96
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:06,690
that the boom run returns is the sum of

97
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:11,550
two terms when the comma difference here

98
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:16,560
equals beta the boomerang returns when

99
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:25,020
gamma here does not equal beta in this

100
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:29,340
case the way 1 must be in the set y DDT

101
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:33,810
alpha comma and after x or in the beta

102
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:37,169
difference we have the y 3 the y 3 if

103
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:40,169
the y 3 first into the same

104
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:46,109
why did it he said why did he said alpha

105
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:54,870
gamma the program also returns so for

106
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:56,639
those for those values solutions they

107
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:01,370
were counted they're counted in the

108
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:05,550
second term and due to the symmetry the

109
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:09,750
BCT can be calculated using the Y D DT

110
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:16,500
or so and actually we can merge these

111
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:21,659
two terms to have a expression here when

112
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:25,439
the M has one S box layer in the middle

113
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:30,240
at the connecting points of e 0 and E 1

114
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:35,370
the our probability can calculate by the

115
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,860
VC T over 2 to the N instead of using

116
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:42,689
this expression from the previous flight

117
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:46,949
for BC T we use a more detailed one this

118
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:50,400
expression looks more complex but it is

119
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:52,819
helpful when we extended it to other

120
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,818
cases

121
00:07:53,419 --> 00:08:01,169
similarly the our probability can be

122
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:05,549
calculated with the set Y D DT note that

123
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:10,620
in this case both the Alpha and the beta

124
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:14,699
difference no or fixed since this S box

125
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:21,629
is located at the connecting point the

126
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:24,389
Alpha and the beta know from the upper

127
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:28,729
trail and the lower trail so how about

128
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:34,229
the S box is far away from the

129
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:38,640
connecting point for those s box either

130
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:42,089
alpha or beta is not fixed let's look at

131
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:48,360
the figure on the right side look at the

132
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:51,300
S box in is 0 the difference alpha comma

133
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,089
and now from the upper trail well the

134
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,329
difference bata here it is the

135
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:59,339
difference between the left of facet and

136
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:03,089
the right of a state and a propagated

137
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:05,430
from the lower trail we call it the

138
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:08,250
lower crossing difference the level

139
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:11,729
crossing difference is not fixed but may

140
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:16,470
follow certain distribution similarly

141
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:18,500
for the sbox in even the input

142
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:22,079
difference gamma all to put a difference

143
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:28,170
beta unknown from the lower to France

144
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:31,649
Oreo and the alpha difference here which

145
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:34,529
is between the pike of Fassett and the

146
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:37,200
front facet and propagated from the

147
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:40,740
upper trio we call it the upper crossing

148
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,040
difference and this difference is also

149
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:48,860
not fixed but may follow certain

150
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:53,640
distributions so for these S boxes they

151
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:57,420
crossing differences are not fixed next

152
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:02,670
we are to extend the PCT to these cases

153
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:05,430
and taking into account the distribution

154
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:10,279
of these crossing differences this is

155
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:14,160
our intuition for the generalized PCT

156
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:19,589
let's go deeper into the ice box in is

157
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,399
zero the S box in red is located in the

158
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,640
U 1

159
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:29,190
it has input/output a difference

160
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:34,310
Alfre comma and is lower cross and

161
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:37,019
difference beta here suppose the beta is

162
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:40,920
independent of the upper trail with

163
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:44,790
which means the value of beta is not

164
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,069
affected by the a betrayal then we can

165
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,790
calculate the our probability in this

166
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:53,370
way we just take into account the

167
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:56,849
distribution of the lower Crossing

168
00:10:53,370 --> 00:11:01,340
difference actually when the beta is

169
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:07,420
constant the calculation is the same

170
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:11,150
the basic obesity and if the if beta is

171
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:15,349
uniformly distributed the calculation

172
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:18,079
becomes this which is identical to the P

173
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:24,860
squared Q squared in the classic

174
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:27,920
Hoberman attack for s box in um we

175
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:30,770
obtained us we obtain similar results

176
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,370
the only difference is that we consider

177
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:38,420
the distribution for the lower crossing

178
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:44,600
our crossing difference alpha here the

179
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:50,089
result is a similar what if two aspects

180
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:55,570
are interrelated in this case the S box

181
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:58,340
a front is 0 and s Box B from even I

182
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:02,390
interrelated the interrelation means

183
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:07,570
that the lower crossing the fringe for S

184
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:11,420
box a comes from S box B and vice-versa

185
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:16,190
in order to handle this case we

186
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:19,670
introduce a new set that D P city it

187
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:22,660
records the number of solutions such

188
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:28,729
that the boomerang will return with

189
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:31,790
comma difference here then we calculated

190
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:35,360
our probability the up probability is

191
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:39,010
actually the ratio of inputs such that

192
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:42,280
the difference propagated from alpha to

193
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:47,180
gamma and then come up propagated to

194
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:50,390
alpha Prime and then it will return with

195
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:53,150
the gum gamma plane here and the gamma

196
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:55,400
plane propagates back to the beta

197
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:58,760
difference the beta is actually the

198
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:02,510
lower crossing difference for S box a if

199
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:07,090
it brings the output value bike to the

200
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:13,060
same why DDT said the boomerang will

201
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:14,880
will will will by will returns so

202
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,520
actually the

203
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,120
, and the gamma plane can take all

204
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:28,490
possible values considering this the

205
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:33,720
final R is calculated with this so this

206
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:38,340
other general cases conversed of these

207
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:41,670
three basic pieces and then we can we

208
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:44,930
can propose our generalized framework of

209
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:48,900
BC T which is captured in this algorithm

210
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:52,680
first we initialize the a.m. with 2

211
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:55,410
meter runs and then extend both chairs

212
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:59,550
with probability one towards the other

213
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:02,370
side through the extension we can trace

214
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:06,740
the distribution of the crossing

215
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:10,470
differences in step three and step four

216
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:13,800
we identify the upper boundary and the

217
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:17,580
lower boundary respectively and lastly

218
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:21,349
we calculate the probability ah using

219
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:25,410
formulas in the previous slide and if a

220
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:30,210
zero is returned it means that two trees

221
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:32,760
are not compatible and note that the

222
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:35,640
boundaries of en are marketed by the

223
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:42,560
ranch where the crossing differences are

224
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:46,610
uniformly distributed then we apply the

225
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:50,459
generalized obesity to skinny and a yes

226
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:54,150
we reevaluate the for bomber and

227
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:56,580
distinguishes of skinny and construct a

228
00:14:54,150 --> 00:15:01,040
six-round related sub K Prime and

229
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,040
distinguished for aes-128

230
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:09,719
skinny is an SP and lightweight block

231
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:12,930
cipher with with a tricky skinny end T

232
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:17,900
denotes the version with block size n

233
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:23,400
and twiki size T next next i will show

234
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:27,240
example am for skinny 64 128 in the

235
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,459
related tricky setting the final TM

236
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,180
contains two runs from the a betrayal

237
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:35,010
and four ramps from the lower trail if

238
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:39,120
using the formula P squared Q squared

239
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:44,100
the probability for en should be 2 to

240
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:46,790
the minus 44 this table shows the

241
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:51,360
detailed information for the trails

242
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:53,699
calculated in seconds on a desktop which

243
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,130
there are probabilities we can calculate

244
00:15:53,700 --> 00:16:03,120
the probabilities for the FIR

245
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:05,700
distinguish in this column these

246
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,589
probabilities are much higher than the

247
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:13,970
probabilities evaluated before we

248
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:17,130
verified the older our probabilities and

249
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:23,279
the 17 rounds a distinguished of a

250
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:28,320
skinny 64 128 this is the result of a

251
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:33,000
skinny for a s 122 we construct a six

252
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:36,060
runs related sub K distinguish it is

253
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,990
known from previous research that the

254
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:42,750
minimum number of active s boxes of all

255
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:45,750
three rounds related a key to friends or

256
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:49,380
traitors is a five there are only two

257
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,890
trails with five active s boxes while

258
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:57,000
there are 18 trails with six active S

259
00:16:52,890 --> 00:17:00,709
boxes from these three round trails we

260
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,390
select the two to construct a six round

261
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:07,379
related sake boomer and distinguish

262
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:12,629
which is shown in this table and the

263
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:16,400
probability is 2 to the minus 109 point

264
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:20,000
four two in this case we use the

265
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,510
generalized obesity to exclude

266
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,220
incompatibility

267
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:31,020
since most combinations are in kept

268
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:35,790
incompatible and we'd like to mention

269
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:38,850
some properties for en the en the lanes

270
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:40,560
of en is many determined by the

271
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:44,129
diffusion effect of

272
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:46,560
linear layer and also it depends on the

273
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:50,640
density of the activist airs of the

274
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:53,960
trails the arc probability is strongly

275
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,240
affected by the properties of the sbox

276
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:01,770
there is also an amine limitation of the

277
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:05,940
generalized obesity for a long am with

278
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:12,030
lunch and strong sbox calculating are

279
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:15,360
might be might be time-consuming and to

280
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:19,139
conclude in this work we propose the

281
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,959
generalized PCT which enables us to

282
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:25,320
identify the boundaries of dependency

283
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:28,820
and the calculate R in the sandwich

284
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:32,250
attack future problems to investigate

285
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:35,610
include extension to non-sports

286
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:37,910
paste the ciphers and improving previous

287
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:46,199
burn attacks

288
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:53,010
thank you thank you thank you are there

289
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:56,490
any questions for ting phone I have one

290
00:18:53,010 --> 00:19:00,000
do you think there's a way of a plane a

291
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,830
version of your results to super s boxes

292
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,920
for instance is what is combined with

293
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:08,040
some linear parts or I guess it's quite

294
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:10,950
a difficult because to calculate

295
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,920
accurately we need to know the

296
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,860
distribution of the crossing differences

297
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,070
if the S box is so much I think it's

298
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:25,110
quite a difficult thank you

299
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:26,520
any questions okay so let's think ring

300
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:31,609
sound again thank you

301
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,609
[Applause]
