1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,500
and the final talk of this session is on

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,240
Cuba Tec like crypt analysis of round

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,400
reduced catch accusing mixed integer

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,610
linear programming and it will be given

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,389
by a song Ling and good gem thanks for

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,378
the introduction

7
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:18,900
in this talk we apply a mile P for

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,810
searching parameters for kipper attack

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:29,028
like a crypt analysis of run reduce the

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:30,869
Kitka check a check is the most famous

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:34,200
permutation based on a primitive

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:37,590
designed by but only at all it was a

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,290
selected as the star 3 standard the

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:44,250
underlying permutation used the Inca

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:47,850
check is cachaca P cachaca can be used

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:53,059
under some kid modes like K Mike and

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:56,010
Tkaczyk Mike it also have some relatives

18
00:00:53,059 --> 00:01:02,010
including authenticated encryption kayak

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:05,188
cage a pseudo-random function cravat for

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:10,200
these kid cachaca constructions do you

21
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:13,559
recovery attacks of great interest for

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,740
these kid constructions the cube attack

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,549
is a useful approach for the key

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,610
recovery there are two types of cubic

25
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:27,180
attacks one year's cube attack like a

26
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:31,280
crypt analysis the other is conditional

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,950
qubit X that makes the indigenous

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,979
programming models improved the

29
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,369
conditional cube attacks greatly as

30
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:46,259
shown in the works of Li at all innocent

31
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:48,119
at all so at natural question arises how

32
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,590
about the cube attack like a crypt

33
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:55,860
analysis using a my ope this question

34
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,579
motivates our research we propose an a

35
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,189
map a

36
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:03,329
a myopic model for cube attack like

37
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:08,250
crypt analysis and apply this model to

38
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:11,359
three key de constructions and obtain

39
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:15,000
the following results

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:19,680
introduction to the Tkaczyk p Kotak p

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,420
has an internal states of bb's which can

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:28,800
be seen as an 5 x 5 array of lanes it

43
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:32,208
iterates a run function and at times B

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:37,200
and and our two parameters for kajak P

45
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:42,890
its run function has five steps theta

46
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:47,910
Rho PI and you de kai applies an sbox

47
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:51,660
it's row and PI and a row just to change

48
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:54,180
the position of state base the

49
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:58,940
mathematical expression of the random

50
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:02,760
function is list here and more clearly

51
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:06,959
the theta step has two columns to stay

52
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:11,399
debate so its output a bit depends on 11

53
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:14,220
import base and if all the columns have

54
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,239
even parity the state will remain the

55
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:21,450
same after setup step in this case we

56
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,450
say the state is in the column parity

57
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:28,109
kernel the properties of the so-called

58
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:37,410
CP kernel is widely used in attacks

59
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:40,670
against the Tkaczyk well state rotates

60
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:46,140
the bees within range and PI step

61
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:49,828
suffers the lanes the algebraic degree

62
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:52,798
of the nonlinear layer is two and we can

63
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:56,130
see that the nonlinear terms come from

64
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,880
the product of two J's on the base in a

65
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:06,750
row we will utilize this property in our

66
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:10,858
attacks do do we can record it as a

67
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:16,019
sister of check kataka P it has an

68
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:21,200
internal space of 384 base can be

69
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:24,270
arranged as four times three array of

70
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,210
words the random function

71
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:30,659
is different from that of a Czech P I

72
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:33,030
read the theta and a kai a steer similar

73
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:37,710
Kai applies an sbox

74
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:42,568
now is on the column and the row west

75
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:50,039
and the east change the base within a

76
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:54,050
line also the mathematical expressions

77
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:57,860
for the pseudo-random function and a

78
00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:01,500
check is designed by instantiating the

79
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,349
underlying permutation of sponge with a

80
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:08,909
check P the sponge construction is shown

81
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:11,430
in this figure and the Tkaczyk itself

82
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:15,569
check skin a message and output a

83
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:18,060
tightest however even it takes the

84
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:22,199
concatenation of a key and the message

85
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:27,840
as input it becomes a mic which is

86
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:30,509
called the Tkaczyk mic the combination

87
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,359
of K check P and the monkey duplex

88
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:39,000
results in the authenticated encryption

89
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:43,680
key the K check P star here is obtained

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,150
by applying the PI inverse and pi just

91
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:53,400
before and after K check PE you can see

92
00:05:48,150 --> 00:06:00,469
from the duplex construction the first

93
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:06,150
output here they here is returned after

94
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:09,979
instead R and F 0 and n step round f1 so

95
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:14,429
that is to say n star is 12 branch and

96
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:21,180
Deborah is one round so the first output

97
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:23,550
is returned after 13 rounds we target KJ

98
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:29,779
versions with this number reduced

99
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:32,669
although KJ has for the rims we target

100
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:37,219
to smaller one with internal states

101
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:37,219
rights 200 in the 400

102
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:47,320
doudou can be an alternative permutation

103
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:55,550
in the duplex we call it doodoo in the

104
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:59,800
cage a mode in qubit X the output debate

105
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:03,949
can be regarded as a boon in polynomial

106
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:08,870
secret variables K and public variables

107
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:12,039
of a given a monomial TI which is a

108
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:15,410
product of the public variables

109
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:17,509
specified by said I then the boolean

110
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,630
polynomial can be written as two parts

111
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:24,800
the first part contains terms that are

112
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:26,960
divides about by the monomial and the

113
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,370
second part contains terms that are not

114
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,159
device provided TI the div public

115
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:37,870
variables here occurred to believers and

116
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:43,550
D is the dimension and the factor here

117
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:45,889
psi is called the super Polly of F with

118
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:49,490
all the cuba variables take all possible

119
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:53,810
values the sum of the polynomial will be

120
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,320
exactly the super Polly in qubit X there

121
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,500
tiger

122
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:03,889
exploit linear super Polly to recover

123
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:07,639
the key in the original cube attack the

124
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:10,669
psi the super Polly is regarded as a

125
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,759
linear expression in all the key B's

126
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:18,740
why are in the cube attack like a crypt

127
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:22,870
analysis dear Tiger uses an a auxilary

128
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:26,599
variables so so that the super Polly

129
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:31,849
depends on the smallest set of key base

130
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:37,069
let's say an IQ base once a cube with

131
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:40,939
parameters an A and I and D is formed

132
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:44,870
the attack process in two phases in the

133
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:49,230
online face dear Tiger builds a lookup

134
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:52,310
table which stores the cube sums

135
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:55,770
mumbling to all possible and Nike B's

136
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:58,880
this face takes a time complexity of two

137
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:03,569
today and I plus D and a memory

138
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:07,290
complexity tutored in I in the online

139
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:11,250
face dear Tiger gets the value of the

140
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:14,490
nao Godzilla Rivera brush and then query

141
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:18,050
deciphered obtained that keeps on with

142
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:22,110
the cube son he looks up the table a

143
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:25,890
right case of the ancillary variables

144
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:29,400
will lead it to a hit in this table in

145
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:35,250
this way the attacker can find recover

146
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:37,770
the Nike base the online face takes a

147
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:42,590
time complexity of two to the an A plus

148
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:45,390
D in this procedure we can see that a

149
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:53,210
good attack should have balanced

150
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:53,210
parameters for an A and an an i and an a

151
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:02,520
record head the random function of K

152
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:06,000
check has the algebraic degree two and

153
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:09,660
the nonlinear terms comes from the

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,320
product of adjacent base so if we avoid

155
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:16,740
the adjacent cuba variables the first

156
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:20,340
round will be linearized so after in

157
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:24,030
runs the algebraic degree will be 2 to

158
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:28,170
the M minus one so with the first round

159
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:32,910
being linearized the task of the MIP

160
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:35,490
model becomes clear that is to find 2 to

161
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:38,699
the M minus 1 dimensional cubes where

162
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:42,420
aim is as large as possible to attack

163
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:45,780
more rounds and find the violence that

164
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:49,589
attacks where the an eye and an a are

165
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:55,490
closed and as small as possible so this

166
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:55,490
is still our tasks for the MLP model

167
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:06,410
before we introduce the MIP model let us

168
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:09,140
see an entry via example suppose 128-bit

169
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:12,560
key is loaded into the first two lanes

170
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:17,720
of this initial state here which means

171
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:21,469
each lane is of 64 bits and cuba

172
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:25,400
variables are placed in placed here

173
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:29,000
these two yellow lanes and these two

174
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,699
lanes are identical so that the cuba

175
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,940
variables will not refuse to other

176
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:40,640
places through SATA this also means that

177
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:43,670
the cuba variables are placed in the

178
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,270
so-called typical node and we also

179
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:51,199
suppose that our gazillion variables are

180
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:54,260
set here just below the first killing

181
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,400
if the Aqua Zellaby variables are

182
00:11:54,260 --> 00:12:00,680
identical to the this killing the first

183
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:06,199
killing also wanted to fuse to other

184
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:10,400
lanes as a result only this the second

185
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:13,660
killing will diffuse through Seeta and

186
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:18,290
after Seeta their operations of Pi and

187
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:21,380
rel these two just change the positions

188
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:24,500
of state base and the next day is the

189
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:27,260
kind operations we can see that the

190
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,840
yellow lanes are not yellow bees are not

191
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:33,530
next to each other so the first round

192
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:38,540
will be linearized and the cuba

193
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:42,650
variables are adjacent to the light blue

194
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:46,750
base that is only light blue key base

195
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:51,470
will multiplied with the Cuba variables

196
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:55,040
this means after up to seven Rams the

197
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:58,100
cube Sun will depend only on the 64

198
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,459
light of lighted key base light blue key

199
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:05,360
base so this is an example of the cube

200
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:10,420
with parameters D and a and I beam over

201
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:13,850
64 from this example

202
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:17,959
we can derive the core of a model that

203
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:20,960
is we need to model three things first

204
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:25,630
we need to model the propagation of Cuba

205
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:29,150
variables and the dimension D and the

206
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:33,610
propagation of key B's through sida and

207
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:38,240
the number of auxiliary variables and

208
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:41,060
last the interaction of key B's and Cuba

209
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,390
variables just before the kind and the

210
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:51,199
count of the number of key B's the cube

211
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:54,560
song will depend on mixed integer linear

212
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,740
programming has been widely used in

213
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:02,569
crypt analysis since Morris it was

214
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:06,320
pioneering work an MA an MIP more the

215
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:09,560
problem is of the form with an objective

216
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,110
function subjected to some linear

217
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:16,310
inequalities the variables are usually

218
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:19,910
chosen from the integers in our case the

219
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:22,819
objective is to minimize an i and an a

220
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:25,910
under the constraint that the dimension

221
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:31,190
is set to 2 to the M minus 1 together

222
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:34,550
with other inequalities and we can find

223
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:38,210
the variables to be binary so the

224
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:43,839
problems unsolved if to find the set of

225
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:43,840
inequalities that can fulfill our goal

226
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:53,109
we take kg jr. version one as an example

227
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:57,350
to derive the inequalities for the model

228
00:14:53,110 --> 00:15:02,090
here the light blue beige are constant

229
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:06,950
in the blue base this Achebe's and the

230
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:10,580
white piece are the non-space note that

231
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:12,980
both the cuba variables and a gazillion

232
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:19,580
variables should have chosen from the

233
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:22,870
non space we let the letters ABC in

234
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:26,440
lowercase true stand for the

235
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:31,690
State and it activeness for this state

236
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:35,980
is denoted by capital letters ABC that

237
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:38,410
is if a beat contains a cubic variable

238
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:43,210
this bit is active and that activeness

239
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:46,390
value is 1 so first first part the

240
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:49,570
propagation of cubed variables and the

241
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:52,540
dimension D since the constraints and

242
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:55,390
the key are fixed so these bees are not

243
00:15:52,540 --> 00:16:00,969
active so the values for the activeness

244
00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:04,449
a zero wire for the non-space we don't

245
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:09,070
know we need to find an assignment we

246
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:14,220
also introduced two extra variables the

247
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:18,640
G for the activeness of column sums and

248
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:21,250
the G to stems for the consumption of

249
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:25,050
degrees of freedom let us see an example

250
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:30,160
if we place two variables V 0 V 1 here

251
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:33,819
the son of this column will be V 0 plus

252
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,510
V 1 so the sum is active so the value

253
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,490
for the GX for that column is one and

254
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:44,500
there is no consumption of degrees of

255
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:48,430
freedom however if we place V 0 at the

256
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:51,160
post positions the column son will be

257
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:54,609
inactive so the value here should be 0

258
00:16:51,160 --> 00:17:00,310
and 1 bits of degree of freedom is

259
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:03,929
concerned so the dimension can be

260
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:07,109
calculated with these variables that is

261
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:11,439
the number of activities in the state

262
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:15,629
minus the number of degree degrees of a

263
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:19,240
freedom concerned that is here and

264
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:23,439
formally the relation of the activities

265
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:26,020
of the state the activities of the

266
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:30,490
column sum and the degrees of freedom

267
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:34,620
consumes can be described with three

268
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,620
inequalities per column

269
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:41,159
and with the activities of the import of

270
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:44,550
data and the activities of the column

271
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:48,470
sums we can derive the activeness of the

272
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:52,169
output of theta since its output bit is

273
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:57,150
the sum of two columns owns and that the

274
00:17:52,170 --> 00:18:00,330
bit itself and from the activities of B

275
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:02,250
we can calculate the activeness of of

276
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:08,720
see directly things

277
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:08,720
it's just change the position of B B's

278
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:18,600
so the second part the propagation of

279
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:22,710
kibby's here we introduce the W of the

280
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:25,439
rivers for the state it it indicates

281
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:29,280
whether a bit contains key information

282
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,770
or not of course the constants contains

283
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,920
no key information so these values are

284
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:37,860
zero and the key B's of course contains

285
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:41,670
key information these are when and for

286
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:46,010
the non-space we we are not sure we also

287
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:48,450
introduce extra variables capital X here

288
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:52,620
to denote whether the column sum

289
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:55,770
contains key information or not seen

290
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:59,280
example here suppose these two key base

291
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:02,040
are k0 and k1 if we set in auxiliary

292
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,010
variables here the column sum will

293
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,820
contain no key information then the

294
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:11,780
value for x for that column is a zero

295
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:15,330
however if we don't set any auxiliary

296
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:18,960
variables for this column the column sum

297
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:24,500
will contain key information for this

298
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:29,720
case we only need one constraint that is

299
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:35,370
all the non non space and the column sum

300
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:38,610
we are sum to one that is one of them

301
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:42,620
will be one and the number of the

302
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:46,149
auxiliary variables can be calculated as

303
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:52,988
the number of non-space being one you

304
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:56,168
the white places lastly the interaction

305
00:19:52,989 --> 00:20:01,029
of cabbage and cuba variables record

306
00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:05,079
that we use the capital ABC to denote

307
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:07,329
the activeness of the state and w to

308
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,188
denote the whether the initial state

309
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:12,399
contains key information or not

310
00:20:09,189 --> 00:20:15,669
accordingly we also introduced Y and day

311
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:19,839
which that they and see we can now

312
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:24,819
collect key bees that are adjacent to

313
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:28,408
Cuba variables so the model is done we

314
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:34,299
apply it to three to check based the

315
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:37,209
constructions for the KJ junior version

316
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:41,499
one version two we improved the previous

317
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:44,139
attacks something interesting is that if

318
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:45,729
the key thrice is reduced one more

319
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:49,928
rounder can be a target for these two

320
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:53,859
versions and for the versions senior

321
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:57,069
virtue v2 we also improved the attacks

322
00:20:53,859 --> 00:21:00,458
and fall due to in the Cajun mode

323
00:20:57,069 --> 00:21:03,908
six rounds can be attacked compared with

324
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:07,619
this version with double senior catches

325
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:12,789
senior one round less can be attacked

326
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:14,918
with you that doodle has a good

327
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:18,249
resistance against the such type of

328
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:20,859
attacks we also have a seven round

329
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:29,259
attacks against the largest version of

330
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:32,978
Kerchak Mike to conclude the mi Opie

331
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:34,719
model does help to improve Cuba tackle

332
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:39,099
like a crypt analysis with better

333
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:43,509
results and it is easier to find the

334
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:46,269
cubes with the mio P model and so lastly

335
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:50,979
this work does not threaten the security

336
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:53,129
of a Nikita cachaça constructions thank

337
00:21:50,979 --> 00:21:53,129
you

338
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,390
questions

339
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:21,429
okay so in the beginning I mentioned

340
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,070
this conditional cube attack how does

341
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:29,860
your results compared to conditional

342
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:33,280
attack constructions a checker

343
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:36,059
constructions which are not listed here

344
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:47,440
conditional Cuba attacks performs better

345
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:49,750
okay thank you Thanks maybe one more

346
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,210
question out of curiosity so you're

347
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:55,059
taking advantage of both the setter and

348
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,740
the sbox lair of the capture

349
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:59,020
constructions have you also looked at

350
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,299
whether your attack can be explained and

351
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,070
expanded to two cases where only one of

352
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:05,650
the two functions is used for example

353
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:14,918
ask on where we have the similar s box

354
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:18,400
but a different linear layer this hike

355
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:23,200
mainly depend on the linear layer and

356
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:26,049
some properties of the kind so when we

357
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,309
change the linear layer I think the

358
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:33,129
results must be totally different okay

359
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:34,629
thank you and thanking all speakers of

360
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,680
the session again and enjoy the coffee

361
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:42,239
break

362
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:42,239
[Applause]
