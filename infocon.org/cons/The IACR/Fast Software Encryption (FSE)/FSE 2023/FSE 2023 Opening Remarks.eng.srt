participation numbers for this

134
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,340
conference until last night we have a

135
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,840
total of 3151 registered participations

136
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,560
among them 85 are in the online online

137
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,180
Zoom room under 266 partitions are

138
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,940
either in Beijing or in Kobe now we

139
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,479
leaks the number of the partitions from

140
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,759
