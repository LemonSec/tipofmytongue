1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,000
uh so welcome back everyone to the

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,600
second day and we're starting today with

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,000
the keynote talks it's my my pleasure to

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,420
introduce the first keynote of Havoc

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,900
2023 which is given by Cy soon so Cy is

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,580
a full professor at the universe at the

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,140
school of cryptology of the University

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,320
of Chinese Academy of Sciences

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,900
um in addition he is very active in the

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,000
Chinese Association for cryptologic

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,420
research where he's a board member

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,640
um his research mostly focuses on

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,980
automatic Crypt analysis so he published

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,399
multiple works on secure SCA automatic

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,140
security analysis of cryptographic

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,300
building blocks and his keynote talk

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,280
will be about Crypt analysis of arax

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,620
ciphers you will discuss some recent

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,780
developments and will also Identify some

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,239
interesting problems for open problems

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,940
so um welcome CUA

22
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,699
for the Flores yours

23
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,539
okay thanks Bart for the introduction so

24
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,539
I'm going to talk about crypto analysis

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,299
of ARX servers and it's recent

26
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,280
developments and open some open

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,700
questions

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,520
so here is the outline of my talk first

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,820
what are ARX servers

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,659
so ARX suffers generally we refer to a

31
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,299
symmetric key Primitives with building

32
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,479
blocks such as addition rotation and

33
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,780
exclusive wall

34
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,200
so to be more General we may allow to

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,579
include some

36
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,159
other bitwise operations here are two

37
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,439
representative ARX efforts for example

38
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,479
the RZ proposed at crypto 2020 under the

39
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,600
spike designed by the National Security

40
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,399
agent agency of U.S

41
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,560
so for Arab suffers since the addition

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,680
operation offers both diffusion and

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,800
confusion functionalities so we do not

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,959
need

45
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:17,340
some options in the Xbox based designs

46
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,819
such as we have no table lookups

47
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,760
so it provides High resilience against

48
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,980
the timing based the set channel attacks

49
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,720
second it is very efficient in software

50
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,360
and because the operations are

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,319
intrinsically supported by modern CPUs

52
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,920
and the implementations of ARX suffers

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,420
are typically very small

54
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,660
in a recent systematic review for that

55
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,720
with block servers

56
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,120
it is stated that the state of the art

57
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,379
ARX Surfers and the ARX lag designs are

58
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,019
not only very fast but also extremely

59
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,319
small in terms of brand footprint and

60
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,040
code size

61
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,180
so ARX efforts can be found everywhere

62
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,180
for example there are block Surfers

63
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,260
stream Surfers hash functions

64
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,480
cryptographic permutations and

65
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,580
Max

66
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,360
under this ARX servers are readily

67
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,379
deployed in real world applications for

68
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,819
example we have

69
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,620
several ISO IEC standards like height

70
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,099
Rea and Chase key also some of the ARX

71
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,819
suffers are used in the transport layer

72
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,000
secure protocols and some other very

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,379
practical protocols also they are

74
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:58,220
widely implemented in some well-known

75
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,220
cryptographic software libraries such as

76
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,799
open SSL

77
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,060
also the Blake 2

78
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,879
hash function it's uh ARX hash function

79
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,760
is used in the Linux system

80
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,919
uh so next I will talk the development

81
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,540
of the crypto analysis of ARX efforts

82
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,020
so for differential attack it is

83
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,620
developed in the

84
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,400
1980s

85
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,180
and for linear attack it is proposed in

86
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,160
1992.

87
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,580
but only in

88
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,800
but only in 2003 we can have some method

89
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,280
to compute the exact correlation of the

90
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,180
linear correlation of addition

91
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,139
and in 2001 we know how to compute the

92
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,060
differential probabilities of modular

93
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,060
additions efficiently so generally

94
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,380
speaking

95
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,040
the development of the techniques for

96
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,460
analyzing AR access

97
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,180
are generally lagged behind for the

98
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,100
crypto analysis of Xbox based designs

99
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,100
also when we talk about ARX efforts we

100
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,620
must mention the

101
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,979
Sun the difference technique developed

102
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,960
to break md5

103
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,299
and here are some other techniques

104
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,580
next I will

105
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,820
introduce some specific techniques for

106
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,860
analyzing AR except first

107
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,800
the differential group analysis

108
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,440
the probability of

109
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,300
of differential of the differential

110
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,720
probability of the addition can be

111
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,780
defined by this formula

112
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,120
so we just actually we just need to

113
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,039
count the number of pairs to satisfy

114
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,680
this equation

115
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,280
so first I will let let us see how to

116
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,520
determine whether a transition is

117
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,860
actually possible

118
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,280
for input difference Alpha Beta and

119
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
output different scholar

120
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,139
if this is a

121
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,220
possible transition then we require the

122
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,199
least significant bit

123
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,120
s

124
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,400
this equation this is

125
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,960
because

126
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,560
the least significant bit uh

127
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,740
it behave linearly in ARX efforts

128
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,100
also for other piece we require this

129
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,780
condition

130
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,380
uh generally speaking if the lower

131
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,940
Beats

132
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,840
are the same then the higher beats must

133
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,960
satisfy this equation

134
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,280
so here is a very simple example if the

135
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,039
input difference

136
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,039
is arva and the beta and the output

137
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,099
difference is comma

138
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,099
then we can check whether this

139
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,440
transition is possible by these

140
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,419
conditions

141
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,020
so for the least significant bit we can

142
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,000
say that one plus one equals zero so

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,440
this condition is fulfilled

144
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:49,199
uh but for this but for this two bit

145
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,280
sequence

146
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,639
at the lower B the lower beats are

147
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,340
are ones so they are equal

148
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,919
so Alpha I minus one equal speed I minus

149
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,060
one and and minus one so we must check

150
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,020
whether the higher beats satisfies this

151
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,080
equation then we can we can check if it

152
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,560
is not

153
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:17,360
so this pattern is impossible

154
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,599
uh this so the second condition can be

155
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,379
summarized as a bitwise equation of this

156
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,560
form

157
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,500
uh note that there are some symmetries

158
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,679
in this equation so beta can be replaced

159
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,899
by alpha or gamma

160
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,719
with this equation we can develop some

161
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,940
automatic methods to analyze the ARX

162
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,540
efforts

163
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,740
so to summarize the probability of the X

164
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,660
of the addition can be

165
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,459
represented by this equation here

166
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:03,360
EQ is a bitwise functional function

167
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,240
function and it is this described in

168
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,779
this equation

169
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,820
so with this analysis uh we can develop

170
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
some automatic methods

171
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,000
for analyze for analyzing ARX efforts

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,320
for example in the conditions

173
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,940
we only

174
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,000
we only involved

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,860
a six piece

176
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,600
so we can model these tuples by

177
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,680
mixed integer linear programming methods

178
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,019
and the objective function can be

179
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,959
modeled by this equation then we can

180
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,760
transform the search of differential

181
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,760
characteristics of ARX suffers into and

182
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,800
mixed integer programming model

183
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,800
next let's say a linear group analysis

184
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,680
there are some different techniques for

185
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,500
linear crypto analysis

186
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,640
and the first developed is the rational

187
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,839
series technique

188
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,060
with this technique the correlation of

189
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,140
the linear approximation of additions

190
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,180
can be computed

191
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,800
by a formula of of this form

192
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,040
here R is a

193
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,380
Joe vector and the C is a column vector

194
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,560
and the edges are two times two two

195
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,420
times two matrices defined as follows

196
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,779
so we only have four different

197
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,040
uh

198
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,880
for different matrices

199
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,820
and here is an example if the linear if

200
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,860
the linear masks

201
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,040
are alpha beta and the gamma often beta

202
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,300
are input masks and Gamma output masks

203
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,260
then we can compute the correlation by

204
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,120
this equation

205
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,240
so say an error are fixed

206
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,680
row vectors and column vectors and let's

207
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,880
start from the least significant bits so

208
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,180
the least significant bits are zero one

209
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,200
and one so it encodes

210
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,500
it encodes the binary the

211
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,519
the integer

212
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,140
three so we must so this equation is A3

213
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,480
and similarly we can determine all the

214
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,839
matrices then we multiply them together

215
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,880
and the correlation is zero

216
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,300
another technique for linear curve

217
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,180
analysis of additions is the finite

218
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,300
automata methods

219
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,220
so here is an example of finite out

220
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,740
automata so we have in this finite State

221
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,920
machine we have two states this one

222
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,800
marked with initial this is the start

223
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,459
state

224
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,920
and this is other states

225
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,940
so for finite automata there are an

226
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,680
input there is

227
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,959
an input string

228
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,540
so this state actually executes

229
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,300
according the

230
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,180
character according to the characters of

231
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,320
the screen so for this finite automata

232
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,519
if the first if the input is 2

233
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,180
then we will start from the you need the

234
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,800
init state

235
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,820
will translate to the one state

236
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,720
so according this table we can model the

237
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,459
transition of the finance automata

238
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,200
on the linear correlation can be

239
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,560
computed by this equivalent

240
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,620
so it's similar we just count the

241
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,279
numbers of zero outputs when it starts

242
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,480
and wins once

243
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,779
so the input string is UI and we compute

244
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,519
the

245
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,700
integer it's represents

246
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,940
so here is the weight Transit we

247
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,220
transform the binary numbers into

248
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,019
integers

249
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:06,060
then we can have a sequence of integers

250
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,800
and here is the finite automata for

251
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,800
addition for the additional operation

252
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,220
so if the input string the input

253
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,320
character is 7 then we

254
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,019
we will start from e0 then we'll

255
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,120
translate to E1

256
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,480
and the Nexus character is real we will

257
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,660
translate from E1 to E1 so this Edge

258
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,639
and the next the character is six

259
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,500
so here is the state so we still

260
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,420
come back to E1

261
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,500
follow this style of analysis we can

262
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,540
model the entire transition

263
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,699
under the correlation the correlation

264
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:06,899
can be computed by the number of times

265
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:11,220
we visit the state E1

266
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,699
and if the automata ends up in the in

267
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:17,399
the states zero then the correlation of

268
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,579
the of the probability will be zero

269
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,160
so similarly the linear Crypt analysis

270
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,560
of

271
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,660
additions can be

272
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,420
modeled with a mixed integer linear

273
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,019
programming we actually model the

274
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,100
transition table of the finite automata

275
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,940
for example for this simple Finance

276
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,240
Finance automata we can model these two

277
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,260
posts

278
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,240
into a set

279
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,579
into a subset of high dimensional

280
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:57,959
vectors

281
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,360
then we can transform

282
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,959
this then we can describe this convex

283
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:07,860
form by this linear inequalities

284
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,699
and also the solution space who derived

285
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,639
the solution space we need to set as

286
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,060
zero equals zero and SN equals 1.

287
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,660
because for other

288
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,300
for other values this will not be an

289
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,439
valid transition

290
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:35,300
next I will talk about differential and

291
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,560
differential linear crypto analysis

292
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,699
for ARX servers it is very difficult to

293
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:48,480
find a differential trials or linear

294
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,360
trails with very high probability or

295
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,279
correlation

296
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,980
we can say from this diagram

297
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,279
when the number of runs

298
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:03,240
get gets higher the probability will

299
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,419
the probability or correlation will get

300
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:07,859
very small

301
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,160
so we can combine very short

302
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,520
differential and linear trails

303
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,859
to form the differential linear attack

304
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,020
in differential linear crypto analysis

305
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,140
we will split

306
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,179
the target server

307
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,880
in two parts

308
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,840
and we will have some assumptions that

309
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,120
these two parts are statistically

310
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,520
independent

311
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,640
so if we can fund a

312
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,440
if we can fund a differential cover

313
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,820
this part

314
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,460
with input different

315
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,860
small Delta and

316
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,600
output the difference Delta with

317
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,760
probability p

318
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,919
and

319
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,280
for the linear part we can find a linear

320
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,539
approximation with bias Epsilon

321
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,539
then if these two parts are

322
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,400
statistically

323
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,380
independent

324
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,039
the correlation of the differential and

325
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,780
the of the differential linear

326
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,539
approximation can be computed by the

327
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,700
probability of the differential and the

328
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,320
correlation of the linear approximation

329
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,740
but generally this formula is not good

330
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,240
for ARX efforts

331
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,299
since we need some type of methods

332
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:45,600
to compute the correlation with only the

333
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,539
input difference under the output linear

334
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,960
mask

335
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,580
since there there may be many

336
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,940
transitions for the big Delta

337
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,520
under the the assumption

338
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,000
of the independence are not valid in

339
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,640
most in most times for ARX efforts

340
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,220
so next I will show how to compute the

341
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,559
exact

342
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,799
differential linear correlation of a

343
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,419
single addition

344
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,640
first we need to introduce some

345
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,419
notations

346
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,660
first I would like to generalize the say

347
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,419
addition operation

348
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:39,059
here we just add another symbol B this

349
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:43,620
B indicates the initial

350
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,440
carry the initial carry bit of the

351
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,740
addition for example if we set b equals

352
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,880
to

353
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,140
if we set b equal to zero

354
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,660
then this is the ordinary

355
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,320
addition

356
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,000
and here

357
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,340
unsignifies the

358
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,640
the word the size of the words of the

359
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,940
additions for example if here is in then

360
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,760
the addition is performed the modulo 2

361
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,539
to the power n

362
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,660
next I will introduce the so-called

363
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,140
carry vector

364
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:34,380
so this Vector is it describes

365
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,500
I already

366
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,840
carry bits of the addition from the

367
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,539
least significant bit to the most

368
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,559
significant bit

369
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,440
so with this notation

370
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,460
we can't split the options of the

371
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,980
operations into

372
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,299
small segments

373
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:06,059
after after this we can derive some

374
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:10,260
recursive relations of the addition

375
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,020
then we can using this recursive

376
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,080
relations to analyze the addition

377
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,460
so this is a quite complicated symbol

378
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,299
uh

379
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,159
so this is a symbol we developed for

380
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,080
analyze the differential and the linear

381
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,000
correlation of

382
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,320
addition

383
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,440
and this is a very rich symbol capturing

384
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,320
a lot of informations

385
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,179
for example for a for the subscript a

386
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,760
it records the

387
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,419
least significant carry bit

388
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:05,840
of the addition of X and Y

389
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,580
and for

390
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,720
for the bit B it records the

391
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,480
least significant

392
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,760
of the addition of

393
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,860
the differential pairs

394
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,159
so X will plus Alpha and where will plus

395
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,500
beta

396
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,440
then for this here is the least

397
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,320
significant care beat

398
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,400
then for u and v here with split

399
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,039
with split the vectors into small parts

400
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,820
and this is these records

401
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,320
the

402
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,320
carobes

403
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,240
generated for for these blue Parts but

404
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,580
for the higher segments of the operands

405
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,760
so this is a quite complicated

406
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,480
symbol but it's all almost capture all

407
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,480
the information we need to

408
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,120
analyze and

409
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,520
an addition of differential pairs

410
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,640
so this symbol actually described some

411
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,740
subsets

412
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,539
and this forms some useful partitions

413
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,679
for example if we fix if we fix the

414
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,500
least significant characters A and A B

415
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,100
then this forms a set this forms a

416
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,840
partition of this base

417
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,260
so with this notations

418
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,860
we can say the differential linear

419
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,880
approximate differential linear

420
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,340
approximation with input difference

421
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,559
Alpha Beta and output

422
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:04,559
a linear mask Lambda

423
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,740
the linear correlation can be computed

424
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,020
using this equation

425
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,380
then if we denote

426
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,179
this part with the function f

427
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,240
so this functions have this function has

428
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,780
a size n

429
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,559
then the differential linear correlation

430
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,200
can be can be computed by this

431
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,299
equivalent

432
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,000
so

433
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,780
if we only use if we only imply this

434
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,400
equation to compute the linear

435
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,400
correlation it's actually a enumeration

436
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,179
of the input space so here we party we

437
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:51,000
partition the input space with this

438
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,480
notation

439
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,220
then with some

440
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,120
computations and

441
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,418
some analysis by this Lima

442
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,520
so this Lima

443
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,280
actually gives a recursive relation

444
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,639
between FK and FK minus 1.

445
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,260
so after this we can derive a similar

446
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,960
rational series for the computation of

447
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,179
differential linear correlations and it

448
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,299
is given by this equation

449
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:47,580
and here I'm 4 times 4 matrices

450
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,220
under the entries of this of this

451
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,520
matrices are computed by this equivalent

452
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,700
so actually the entries are determined

453
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,059
by the by the number of elements

454
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:07,940
of the subsets of the partition

455
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,520
here are some

456
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,059
here are some concrete examples

457
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:18,419
of the partition of the set

458
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:23,100
so if if you weigh an a b u v and a b

459
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,419
equals

460
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:28,740
zero zero zero zero then this subsides

461
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,659
equals

462
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,140
zero zero zero one and one zero so this

463
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,140
table records all possible partitions of

464
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,500
the site

465
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:47,940
so with this equation we can compute the

466
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,659
exact differential linear correlation of

467
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:54,659
a single addition

468
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:57,299
and here are some examples note that

469
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:00,960
before this this Theory all the

470
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,600
computations are approximate numbers but

471
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,860
this one are exact

472
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,799
so here is a table actually for

473
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,320
more General differential linear Chrome

474
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,679
analysis here we have a rotation offset

475
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,559
so it's rotational differential linear

476
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:22,559
approximation

477
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:26,520
so in this table we can see some very

478
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,320
strange numbers

479
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,200
but these numbers are exact this this

480
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,020
means if you input all the possible

481
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,940
input pair and count the number of

482
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,799
the output

483
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,860
so we can derive this

484
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,580
this numbers these figures

485
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,860
and here is the correlation for the

486
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,799
differential linear approximation of the

487
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,779
modular addition of 2 to the power 32.

488
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,679
in this table we can find some other

489
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,740
strange numbers for example here the 65.

490
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,400
however with

491
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,760
if we can only compute the differential

492
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,260
linear the correlation of the

493
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,600
differential of linear approximation of

494
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,100
a single

495
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,799
addition we cannot compute we cannot

496
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:28,559
analyze a full Cipher

497
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,960
so here we need the help of the

498
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,900
so-called

499
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,740
molavez key technique

500
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:39,179
is technique

501
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:41,159
the in we input

502
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,919
a set of

503
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,840
a probability distributions

504
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,659
for example here the distribution is the

505
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:54,779
probability of the

506
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:59,039
it's a pair they are not the same

507
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,919
so where this equation is

508
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,679
have some relation with differential

509
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:07,380
linear crypto analysis so we can write

510
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,140
this equation into this form then we can

511
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,460
say

512
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,860
it's actually a differential linear

513
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,580
approximation with output

514
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,820
linear masks being unit vectors

515
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,059
so with molavesky's technique and the

516
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,380
input

517
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,080
a probability distribution we can

518
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,120
compute this probability

519
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,720
and here is a

520
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,460
formula to summarize the idea

521
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,100
so it's quite complicated so I want to

522
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,899
go into the details

523
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,799
so this equation is for

524
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,200
ordinary differential linear crypto

525
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,380
analysis and this one

526
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,480
yes this one is also for differential

527
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,620
linear crypto analysis but only for more

528
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,460
specific for the additional operation

529
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,080
and here H are a sequence H are some

530
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,240
four times Matrix four times four

531
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,220
matrices

532
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,480
so one involves it when when involve the

533
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,140
analysis of additions we always have

534
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,659
some formulas like this the

535
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:41,100
multiplication of a sequence of matrices

536
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,460
but actually we don't discover the

537
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:50,000
intrinsic relations of this analysis

538
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,960
here are some

539
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,080
examples of ARX servers and we will try

540
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,320
to use the techniques mentioned in the

541
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,260
previous previously to analyze them here

542
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,260
is arzite steppage and spec

543
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,399
and here this table records some

544
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,740
a rotational differential linear

545
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,500
distinguishers for round reduced are

546
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,480
that

547
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,679
for example for the four round Cipher we

548
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:23,460
can

549
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,340
identify

550
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,919
a deterministic

551
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,919
distinguisher

552
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,640
since all these distinguishers are all

553
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,240
very very high correlation we can

554
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,720
verify them in practice so here is a

555
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,200
correlation predicted by the theory and

556
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,899
here are the

557
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:50,520
experimental correlations we can see

558
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,779
they are very close

559
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:00,480
now here is the here are the results for

560
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,960
C plus

561
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,200
and this column records the inputted

562
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,659
difference and this column

563
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:14,240
are the output linear masks

564
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,960
for this we can see the correlation

565
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,460
predicted by the

566
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,140
by the theory

567
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,000
is much lower

568
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,419
than the experimental correlation so

569
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:30,659
this means there are some assumptions in

570
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,940
the analysis

571
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,240
uh do not host since in the analysis

572
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,299
when we use molave Whiskey's Technique

573
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:44,779
we assume the beats every single Beats

574
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:48,360
are in the statistically independent

575
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,719
so this assumption may not valid so this

576
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,179
this may be the reason for the

577
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:01,100
for they are not very close

578
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,860
and here is the here are the results for

579
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,699
Spike

580
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:11,820
for example with this technique we

581
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,940
identify a differential linear

582
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,399
distinguisher for terron's spec

583
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:21,779
note that in a very recent work in ctrsa

584
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,779
2023

585
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,260
some researchers fund

586
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,120
a terror on the

587
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,279
differential linear distinguisher of

588
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,860
spec with correlation

589
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,000
here

590
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,120
so this is a bit higher than this one

591
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,320
also with this technique we can explain

592
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,659
some experimental distinguishers without

593
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:53,760
theoretical interpretation for example

594
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,658
in this paper

595
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:00,960
stated that we are not concerned about

596
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,820
why it shows

597
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,539
a rotation property property or why it

598
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:09,359
reaches such a best level

599
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,000
so with this technique we can

600
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,540
theoretically Analyze This distinguisher

601
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,139
when the input the difference is one the

602
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:23,899
output difference is a unit vector

603
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,940
then the predicted correlation

604
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,359
with our method is 2 to the power minus

605
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,280
6.6

606
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,099
under the probability

607
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:39,119
in the experiments is 2 to the power -6

608
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,000
so they are very close

609
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,520
so we can interpret some

610
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,418
theoretical distinguishers

611
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,000
now here I would like to give some

612
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,480
brief introduction of differential

613
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,520
rotational differential linear crypto

614
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,440
analysis actually I have mentioned this

615
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,160
before but because the theory developed

616
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,800
for rotational differential linear

617
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,720
analysis and ordinary differential

618
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,540
linear crypto analysis are essentially

619
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,400
the same

620
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,400
so in ordinary differentials the

621
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,800
differential pair is X and the X Plus

622
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,060
Delta

623
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,880
but for rotational difference

624
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,339
we first rotate

625
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:29,099
the input and then we plus the

626
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,339
difference

627
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,500
so if we rotate this one

628
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,320
this input by

629
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,480
an offset T and the Plus

630
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:44,520
this operands and the difference will be

631
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,220
Delta this means we have a rotation

632
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,940
difference of Delta with rotation offset

633
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,240
t

634
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,480
so we can generalize the differential

635
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,900
linear crypto analysis by replace the

636
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,900
ordinary differential part with a

637
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,400
rotational differential

638
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:09,480
and here are the

639
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,140
formulas for compute the

640
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,780
correlation of the differential linear

641
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,359
approximation they are very similar to

642
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:20,280
the ordinary differential linear crypto

643
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,760
analysis

644
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,560
but this also

645
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,260
relies on the assumption that these two

646
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:32,960
parts are statistically independent

647
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,460
so we also need to develop some

648
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,980
method to compute

649
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,640
this correlation with only the input

650
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,640
difference and the output linear mask

651
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,339
so here is a short summarization of

652
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,780
molavezky's technique

653
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,960
so given the probability distribution of

654
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,359
the input bits and with the assumption

655
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,540
that these events are independent we can

656
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,700
derive the probability distribution of

657
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,320
the next runs

658
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,440
so with this method we can compute

659
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,540
runs by runs

660
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,660
to compute the final linear

661
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,839
approximation and sometimes this these

662
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,240
two very powerful distinct

663
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,940
distinguishers such as the deterministic

664
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,359
ones

665
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,720
so here is the equation for

666
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,660
using molaveski's technique with the

667
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,020
theory developed previously to compute

668
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,300
the exact

669
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,880
correlation of a single

670
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,980
Edition

671
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,460
so it's very complicated but the idea

672
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,940
are actually ideas are actually are very

673
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,359
similar

674
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,040
it's also a sequence

675
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,400
multiplication of matrices

676
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,400
so they must have some intrinsic

677
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,940
relation with the rational series

678
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,859
technique but we don't know

679
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:22,759
what it is

680
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,820
so for ARX servers we also have some

681
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,339
other techniques

682
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:32,040
for example for the probability neutral

683
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,859
beats technique Boomerang understand the

684
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:37,980
difference technique

685
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:42,060
and for this techniques I list some

686
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,839
papers

687
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,660
and if the audience are interested in it

688
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,280
you can refer to these papers

689
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,380
here are for boomerang cryptanalysis

690
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,160
and here is the sun the

691
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,079
difference technique for analyze some

692
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,960
a lot of hash functions

693
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,660
and this is the definition of the sun

694
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,780
difference they are very uh very

695
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,420
different from the ordinary different

696
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,640
difference defined by the exclusive wall

697
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,500
to

698
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,980
search for sand difference there are

699
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,740
three types of methods the first one is

700
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,740
the handcraft method and the second one

701
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,940
is some heuristic search methods with

702
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,060
with some type of gas and determined

703
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,740
methods

704
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,040
and recently there are some automated

705
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,859
search tools developed based on mixed

706
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:54,500
integer programming set and smt

707
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,619
and for details we refer the audience to

708
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:01,640
these papers

709
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,320
then I would like to

710
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,060
mention the automatic tools for

711
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,920
analyzing ARX efforts

712
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,700
the first one is some dedicated

713
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,060
search software developed with General

714
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,280
programming language

715
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,760
for example the ARX toolkit

716
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,980
also we have some

717
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:32,280
methods based on matsis test first the

718
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,859
search algorithm and its variance

719
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,700
also we have some methods based on mixed

720
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,480
integer linear programming and the

721
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,480
satisfability theory

722
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,900
very recently some researchers

723
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,920
try to

724
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,200
try to automate the search of

725
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,780
differential linear

726
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:11,280
trails with the theory with the theory

727
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,400
we developed previously with a mixed

728
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,980
integer quadratic constraint programming

729
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,880
and here are some here are two papers

730
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,119
recently uploaded to the ePrint and this

731
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:28,040
one is published at ctrsa

732
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,619
but uh actually these methods are not

733
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:34,980
quite generic and there are a lot of

734
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,460
problems required to be solved to make

735
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,599
the tools more efficient

736
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:46,099
finally I would like to

737
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:49,260
give some

738
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,900
open questions the first one is the

739
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,339
differential and the linear curved

740
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:59,220
analysis of multiple connected Editions

741
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,700
so the simplest one

742
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,119
is Illustrated in this figure we just

743
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:09,119
have two additions and we connect them

744
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,440
together

745
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,720
and actually we have we already have

746
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,480
some preliminary results for this type

747
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,200
of combination

748
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,280
but in real life it can be

749
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,200
much complicated

750
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,740
for example the additions May connected

751
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,380
via rotations

752
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,599
the exclusive War

753
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,339
for example in ta

754
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:41,460
XTA under this effort developed by

755
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,280
Chinese researchers and some and the

756
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,780
Chan

757
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,020
also Cha-Cha Blake

758
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,780
Rea and salsa we all have such

759
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,119
connected Editions

760
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,420
so if we analyze with the previous

761
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:04,020
previously Theory we need to split

762
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,740
them into independent part

763
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,500
then combine the analysis together but

764
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,060
in this process

765
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,359
we actually into we actually introduce

766
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,480
the system into some

767
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,800
not verify the assumptions

768
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,359
so it can be even

769
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,839
more complicated the additions can be

770
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:36,020
connected via some Xboxes

771
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:41,160
so how to analyze this type of Parts as

772
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,240
a

773
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,740
as a whole it's a very interesting

774
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,879
open question

775
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,700
also in the literature of the crypto

776
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,960
analysis of ARX efforts we have many

777
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,660
uh experimental distinguishers without

778
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,399
theoretical interpretation

779
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:10,020
here I list some of the distinguishers

780
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,200
for example here are four differential

781
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,359
linear

782
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:19,279
distinguisher for chesky

783
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,980
and these are the experimental

784
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,380
correlations the experimental

785
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,119
correlations are very high but if we use

786
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,060
existing Theory to estimate the

787
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,579
correlation they are

788
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,339
far the value are far away from this

789
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:41,099
experimental

790
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:43,819
correlations

791
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,940
and here are some

792
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,940
distinguishers for Charter this

793
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,980
distinguishers

794
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,700
all of them without a theoretical

795
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,020
interpretation

796
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,060
and here are some experimental

797
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:04,040
distinguishers of salsa

798
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,339
and here is

799
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:18,540
here is a another concrete example

800
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,180
so in the theoretical

801
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,960
prediction the correlation is about 2 to

802
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,800
the power minus 42.

803
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,000
so

804
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,740
this distinguisher uh is used in some

805
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:37,619
attacks in salsa but we cannot verify it

806
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:41,339
experimentally so some attacks of ARX

807
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:44,520
suffers are actually not

808
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,660
quite reliable

809
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,319
and there are some

810
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,020
here is another example the theoretical

811
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,940
prediction is

812
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,300
extremely small

813
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,180
but is they actually experimental

814
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,980
correlation is extremely high

815
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,940
there are some efforts to interpret

816
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,980
this the red this experimental

817
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,260
distinguishers for example in this work

818
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:23,280
uh the distinguisher I listed previously

819
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,640
in in the previous slides

820
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,660
is actually

821
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,380
is actually I think

822
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,500
is this one dissolved but when you look

823
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,520
into the paper the style of the analysis

824
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,400
is not quite satisfiable called

825
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,060
because it's

826
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,119
it gives you a fail of quite intentional

827
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,780
to analyze the specific

828
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,400
distinguisher every step

829
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,220
is try to explain the the very high bias

830
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,660
so it's not a unified framework then we

831
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,359
apply this for framework back to a

832
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,220
specific server

833
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,619
so I think this one is not quite

834
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:17,839
satisfying for to solve these problems

835
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,780
so finally is a conclusion

836
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,680
so in ARX Crypt analysis we have made

837
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,440
some significant progress

838
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,440
and also there are a lot of unsolved

839
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,540
problems

840
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,920
okay thank you very much

841
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,300
hello okay thanks sir for the

842
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,880
interesting presentation and let me

843
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,619
first start with Beijing are there any

844
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,060
questions in the room in Beijing

845
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,980
since yesterday's talk it's very

846
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,540
interesting I have a question have you

847
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:31,319
tried to compare it to compute the

848
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:34,220
correlation for differential linear

849
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:38,640
approximation with a traditional method

850
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,680
for example we can express the

851
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,460
modular addition as

852
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,220
as X or

853
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,980
for example yeah I say X all and the

854
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,819
beat by beats uh what's uh zoom in to

855
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:59,300
use

856
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,319
to apply this type of mirrors

857
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,980
yeah yeah yeah yeah yes we we tried this

858
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,540
this type of analysis

859
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,160
oh actually it's this one so we tried to

860
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,660
use this formula to compute the

861
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,300
differential linear correlation it's

862
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,520
very inaccurate

863
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,740
I think it's not applicable generally

864
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,960
for ARX servers

865
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,200
so the the previously when we do not

866
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,780
have method for compute the exact

867
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,240
differential linear correlations I think

868
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,540
the only method is

869
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:47,000
uh the only method is some

870
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,140
there are some papers I

871
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,859
sorry I forgot the papers but we also

872
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,440
have the mola base pins technique well

873
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,079
molovisk is technique only

874
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:04,740
applied applicable to linear masks being

875
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,759
unit vectors

876
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,640
so thank you thanks for your requesting

877
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,420
thank you another question is I will try

878
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,380
to supply the supplies a modular

879
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,599
addition

880
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:25,440
into several exports and to compute the

881
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,780
correlation for differential linear

882
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,359
approximation

883
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:32,579
yeah I

884
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:38,160
I didn't try this approach but I think

885
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,260
because in our analysis we actually

886
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,480
split into

887
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,180
into a recursive relation so maybe

888
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:48,540
essentially this type of analysis have

889
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:52,200
some relations with the approach you

890
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,640
proposed

891
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,880
but we don't just lead it as

892
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,000
small Xboxes because our

893
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,819
our recursive relation actually split it

894
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:06,680
into bits I think yeah yeah

895
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,500
according to the previous results for

896
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,800
the linear approximation maybe there are

897
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,559
some difference between these two

898
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,059
methods but maybe it's not very

899
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:24,420
different I think yeah sorry thank you

900
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,760
thank you

901
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,740
okay thank you is there another question

902
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,359
from Beijing

903
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:34,920
hi hi thank you for the talk ah I'm here

904
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,619
um I just wondering in this when you're

905
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:40,319
showing the uh relation between the

906
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,559
theory and experimental of uh values

907
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:46,500
sorry can you repeat I

908
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,720
so when you're showing like I think in

909
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,800
slide 35 36 the relationship between the

910
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,200
the experimental

911
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:55,940
um

912
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:00,180
estimators and the expected ones

913
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,819
uh yeah that one I was just wondering

914
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:06,119
are the when you estimate them through

915
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:08,819
the experiment the variances of the

916
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:12,960
estimation are are they low or are they

917
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,040
like actually important here

918
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,059
bloom in this one yeah

919
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:23,160
uh

920
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,040
sorry I I don't quite get your question

921
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,980
like yeah through the experiment you

922
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,160
estimate the theoretical value right uh

923
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,400
it's you mean I how I fund these

924
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,160
distinguishers yeah so when you find

925
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,040
these estimators uh the variance during

926
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,980
the estimation yeah to identify these

927
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:48,119
distinguishers I use a theoretical I use

928
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:49,440
theoretical

929
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,140
analysis because we actually need to

930
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,900
enumerate a lot of possible combinations

931
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,800
if we use experimental approach then it

932
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,200
will not be possible because the time

933
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,420
complexity is quite High

934
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,240
okay so we need in the experiment we

935
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,760
actually because the block says it's

936
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,680
very small we can

937
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,960
we can enumerate all possible input

938
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,700
tires

939
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,520
okay okay another thanks for your

940
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,040
question okay just another question when

941
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,520
you're showing this open problem about

942
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,140
uh the differential in linear Krypt

943
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,780
analysis of multiple connected editions

944
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,900
which of the techniques would you think

945
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,660
or advise are better for tackling this

946
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,899
problem

947
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:40,380
uh actually I'm not quite have some

948
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,099
concrete idea but I think one very

949
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:45,480
important

950
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,400
breakthrough will

951
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,460
will be if we can avoid the Assumption

952
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,180
of bitwise Independence then we may can

953
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,780
maybe we can solve these problems

954
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,240
but I don't know actually I don't know

955
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,980
how to solve it

956
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,619
yeah just uh just like uh maybe a

957
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,440
directional guidance that you might have

958
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,720
uh yeah thank you thank you a lot thank

959
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,140
you very much

960
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,640
okay thank you um another question from

961
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,299
Beijing Maybe

962
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:22,260
hello

963
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,839
yeah according to my understandings

964
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:30,559
I have a simple question okay okay

965
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:35,460
same to the last question there is a gap

966
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:39,559
between the theoretical and actual value

967
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:43,020
and what's the reason depends on

968
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,339
um

969
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:48,559
um runs or whatever what's the possible

970
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:53,540
reason for this just like the example in

971
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:57,540
Spike spike

972
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,680
you mean the reason of why the

973
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,760
theoretical analysis is not match the

974
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,520
experimental it I see it maybe depends

975
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,900
on Juan's the cipher you know

976
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,220
or something else

977
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:22,339
the reason for the gap between

978
00:55:22,339 --> 00:55:26,400
theoretical value and the uh and the

979
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,180
actual value in experiments

980
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,300
I just want to uh

981
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,480
I think there are some between this the

982
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,960
reasons I think it comes from the

983
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:45,380
assumptions we employed in the analysis

984
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,380
the the independence assumption does not

985
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,020
hold in practice

986
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:55,740
uh the independence

987
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,780
assumption

988
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,480
um yeah because in the analysis we

989
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,599
assume everything causing

990
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,359
in the analysis we actually

991
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:10,759
rely on the mola base case technique

992
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,980
yes if so if it depends on assumption I

993
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,200
have another question whether some

994
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,180
conclusions such as upbound of this Gap

995
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:27,780
uh to boost our confidence to use this

996
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:31,920
theoretical value in our works

997
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,460
is whether there whether some

998
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,760
conclusions such as

999
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,579
upbound of this game

1000
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:44,160
uh which means some method to Upper

1001
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,300
bound this guy which which which can

1002
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,780
boost our computation in in attack to

1003
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,079
use this theoretical

1004
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,700
theoretical value in our attacks

1005
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,980
sorry I don't know how to Upper bound

1006
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,980
any technique through Upper boundless

1007
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,740
maybe it's this Gap maybe based on some

1008
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,500
assumption we can derive this up yeah

1009
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:16,380
yeah maybe I just want to to know uh

1010
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:19,440
whether it's possible to do the in this

1011
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,619
way

1012
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,339
I don't know I'm not sure okay okay

1013
00:57:25,339 --> 00:57:27,839
it's very interesting thank you very

1014
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,640
much

1015
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,800
okay thank you um

1016
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,480
let me first see if there is a question

1017
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,140
in Kobe

1018
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,279
foreign

1019
00:57:43,819 --> 00:57:45,960
maybe there was one more question in

1020
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,980
Beijing

1021
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,760
or online

1022
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:54,839
still ah yes who are you

1023
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:58,380
oh I'm sorry now you're online

1024
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:02,099
no no no I'm in Beijing now okay just go

1025
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:03,480
ahead

1026
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,200
uh hello uh according to my outstanding

1027
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,280
the goal of your theory is to uh

1028
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,440
describe the transition of the

1029
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,700
differential and uh your goal is to

1030
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:23,460
describe the differential and the linear

1031
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,000
transitions through the modular Edition

1032
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,880
and I I was wondering if it is possible

1033
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,960
to apply this

1034
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,780
analysis method to

1035
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:40,619
other types of attacks for example

1036
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:43,799
um bombera attacks

1037
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:48,480
uh yeah I think the techniques may be

1038
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,500
have some

1039
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:54,119
I think this techniques are actually

1040
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:57,180
related for example the theory developed

1041
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:00,299
in this work can be used in the analysis

1042
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:03,780
of the boomerang yeah I think says to

1043
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,000
type plus they are they are differential

1044
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,740
actually essentially they are

1045
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:09,059
differential

1046
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:13,859
analysis so have you ever tried this

1047
00:59:13,859 --> 00:59:16,740
method to bomb around attacks

1048
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:21,599
yeah actually we have some some results

1049
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,020
on the on compute to be more accurately

1050
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:28,500
computes the the boomerang

1051
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,020
but we just don't

1052
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:34,200
publish yeah yes okay okay okay because

1053
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,240
but the the techniques are actually the

1054
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,619
same

1055
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:41,819
okay I okay I say thanks

1056
00:59:41,819 --> 00:59:43,920
thank you very much

1057
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,359
okay thanks

1058
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:48,059
um it's actually already passed uh 10 in

1059
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:50,040
Beijing past 11 here so

1060
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:53,040
um I would like to stop here I mean we

1061
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,599
can continue the discussion offline if

1062
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:57,000
you want so um let's please join me in

1063
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,220
thanking CUA

1064
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,180
thank you very much
