1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
position of the last day which will be

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,500
on crypto analysis of authenticated

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,500
encryption schemes it will contain free

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,460
paper

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,559
the first one is Crypt analysis of

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,120
rocker and feasibility of its security

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,860
Claim by akinori Jose

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,140
is

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,199
once again

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,580
introduction and thank you for coming uh

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,380
the last

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,420
so let's tell Friday morning talks as

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,239
I've set up and get so maybe a

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,300
last day so I think everyone drink much

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,600
so I think you enjoy so I'm not sure the

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,760
how many people come in the Beijing

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,180
venue but I want to talk to this one so

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,039
Chris analysis of local and the

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,500
feasibility of its security claim

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,180
okay so this is all about you okay

21
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,699
was proposed at the Sacramento at FSC

22
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,180
last year

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,180
[Music]

24
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,140
5G system

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,040
so the secondary claim is interesting so

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,140
256 bit security against key recovery

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,460
and distinguishing attacks and 128 bit

28
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,979
security against the forgery attack

29
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:26,520
so you mean yeah so actually these two

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,580
security two attacks so that we uh they

31
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,979
claim the unbalanced with security

32
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,960
so we have two contributions the first

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,360
one is we first break the security claim

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,840
of local so local claimed the 256-bit

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,119
security against key recovery but we

36
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,060
show the attack uh to recover the secret

37
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,079
key with a complexity to the 128. and

38
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,479
another attack is I don't know another

39
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,880
contribution is exploring the

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,259
feasibility of the original security

41
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,079
camera blocker so originally they claim

42
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,659
the unbalanced big security but we now

43
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,100
discuss the feasibility and

44
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,860
infeasibility results about this uh

45
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,020
unbarrassed with security

46
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,318
okay so now let's start the main so the

47
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,360
special specification local

48
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,239
okay so the Loca is as based aad

49
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,520
proposed last year FSC so the asni and

50
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,160
the cemento friendly design so if we use

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,640
the high end software so

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,000
it achieves super ultra high speed and

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,459
the over 100 gigabs

54
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,500
original security gram is like this

55
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,680
unbalanced one but uh

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,980
before our publication center after the

57
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,620
publication that they had post paper so

58
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,620
they updated

59
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,260
versions and uh indistinguishability

60
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,440
security is downgraded from

61
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,959
256 bits to 128 bit but yeah so that in

62
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,900
our talks we focus on the this uh after

63
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,300
that we focus on this uh unbalanced bit

64
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,120
security okay okay so this is the

65
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,379
structure of local so local is online

66
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:10,739
permutation based AED so first uh none

67
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,940
sends 200 at 128 bit announce and

68
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,580
256-bit secret key is uh initial State

69
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,800
and this initial state is updated by the

70
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,780
London function 20 times but while

71
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,200
involving the land constant zz1 so after

72
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,400
initialization we absorb the two 128 bit

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,739
Associated data every round functions

74
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,519
and after absorbing everything we

75
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,819
Enclave the message like this and after

76
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,900
encrypting and then finally they update

77
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,799
the

78
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,560
internal state by using the land

79
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,340
function 20 times again then it outputs

80
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,519
are packed

81
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,780
so this is a round function so the r is

82
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,580
this okay so the first uh internal state

83
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,140
of the local is 8 100 by 8 128 bit

84
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,799
States and uh this internal state is

85
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,040
updated by four AES round functions and

86
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,978
X are eight exclusive or

87
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:21,779
so

88
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,259
by using AES and I so that AES Inc

89
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,419
operations and excretionable operation

90
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,840
is enough to compute these Networks

91
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,259
and also to encrypt the message so we

92
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,199
also use the as long functions here and

93
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,340
here and generates the key stream and

94
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,280
encrypts the message and uh so get uh

95
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,359
generates the ciphertext

96
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,220
so one interesting part of the local is

97
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,960
unbalanced security unbalanced bit

98
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
security

99
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,780
so first uh local claim

100
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,860
256-bit key recovery security and 100

101
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,300
128 bit tag

102
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,199
so we focus on this unbalancedness and

103
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,199
by exploiting this path so we propose a

104
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,759
critical body attack with the complexity

105
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,979
of the two to the tag ranks

106
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,759
so 2 to the 128. so another interesting

107
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,039
password but this part is downgraded

108
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,120
after the in the the updated version but

109
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,060
original version say 256 bit in the

110
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,720
security and 128-bit tag so we cons

111
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,120
because that is security definitions and

112
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,800
uh so shows a feasibility and

113
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,660
infeasibility result

114
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,039
okay so first part is attack

115
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,360
so local

116
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,880
claims this unbalanced bit security but

117
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,440
what is the issue

118
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,840
so now let's consider a very simple

119
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,020
super simple tag so now we have we are

120
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,100
attackers we just query to the nct1 to

121
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,139
the Decon rocker

122
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,840
of course there's a decision Works may

123
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,520
be bought

124
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,520
it's a embodied ciphertext but then so

125
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,820
that okay so the next we change the tag

126
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,820
attack

127
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,220
but of course there's a

128
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,800
dividing this reputation we always get

129
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,199
one answer plan text Bill

130
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,419
so attacker can create it is 128

131
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:38,280
non-cti and get the p with the lower

132
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,819
than to the 128 complexity so of course

133
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,479
it tells this attack never invalidates

134
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,840
the project attack level but uh so the

135
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,539
security company security is 256 bits so

136
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,340
that it's a no problem for the clinical

137
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,479
body attack

138
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,979
so this attack so first attacker can

139
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,840
attack a credit to the nouns and print

140
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,020
text and get the cipher text T then okay

141
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,780
so the next attack so inputs as

142
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,300
hypothetic cyphatic difference Delta out

143
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,639
and the query to the decoration worker

144
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,060
by changing the tag and this is a credit

145
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,940
to the two to the 128 speed times then

146
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,639
we get some prefix

147
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,639
128.

148
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,000
and chosen Delta

149
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,479
so what do we learn from this so

150
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,180
Loca is nouns based AED

151
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,139
so family design nouns based AED so that

152
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,319
we can eliminate attack using the PC

153
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,300
player with the same nouns because we

154
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,759
cannot collect such PC Pair by using the

155
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,500
encryption worker

156
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,199
but now local claims unbalanced

157
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,840
unbalanced security claims and balanced

158
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,900
security then but we can correct such a

159
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,199
pair by using the decryption Oracle by

160
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,599
creating the to the toglings

161
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,240
then so tau is uh lower than security

162
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,180
level so we must care about such attacks

163
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,280
so that even if okay so our sample is

164
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,800
announced based only nouns misuse is out

165
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,160
of claim even if we sell even if

166
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,319
designers say like this

167
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,660
we need to care about it

168
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,599
so the case of the local is like this so

169
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,958
the local say non-respecting only so

170
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,520
designer doesn't consider the attack

171
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,919
using the PC pair with the seminars so

172
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,279
we do it okay so the first now we have

173
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,100
two pairs with the same nouns so now

174
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,200
nouns is the same so the internal state

175
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,980
of the beginning is the same and we have

176
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,380
we input the output difference here so

177
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,920
here byte is a non-zero difference

178
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,680
and we know this difference

179
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,380
and so that this device goes to here and

180
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,440
blah blah blah blah here and here so now

181
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,180
we focus on this area around the

182
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,760
functions so from this to the we know

183
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,100
this input difference and also that we

184
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,320
compute the output different we know the

185
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,120
output Difference by observing the

186
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,500
difference of the message here so then a

187
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,660
known difference and no difference and

188
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,000
the Xbox so then

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,180
this is a property of the AES we can get

190
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,420
two over four candidates

191
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,820
okay so that by using this idea so that

192
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,580
we just uh okay we now Define here and

193
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,620
the propagate then after that so that

194
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,740
this is yellow

195
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,519
bytes and Known Zero yellow byte uh

196
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,760
known difference and the gray belts uh

197
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,060
unknown difference but so we have a five

198
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,940
so it's a bit difficult to look at so a

199
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,600
b c d e here these five a slant

200
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,300
functions we know input and output

201
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,940
differences so

202
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,760
we can reduce the number of candidates

203
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,700
of the each 128 bit state to the 2 to

204
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,339
the 60 candidates with high probability

205
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:20,279
so under step-by-step procedure requires

206
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,839
affordable internet state with a

207
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,420
complexity of the 64 but that is the 64

208
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,060
is not so practical so now we want to

209
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,279
improve that complexity by using a meter

210
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,080
in the middle idea

211
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,300
so okay this is a bit it's a bit

212
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,940
difficult to look at but now we want to

213
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,839
compute this S2 fiber uh uh one Quantum

214
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,959
of the s25 and the two methods so fast

215
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,940
so we know this this uh

216
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,399
uh a no add

217
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,640
verb bytes and that these tomato bytes

218
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,920
candidate is reduced to the two to the

219
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,260
eight so that the computer like this and

220
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,779
also the lead part is like this and

221
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,220
that's also check the meat in the middle

222
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,980
so the two to the eight candles and to

223
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,740
the 20 candies and with 72-bit matching

224
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,040
so we can reduce uh we can get the

225
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,740
correct ones with high probability

226
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,079
so this is experimental results so that

227
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,540
I of course this attack is practical so

228
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,120
I we implemented this attack as a result

229
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,399
so there is 2 to the 20 time complexes

230
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,740
the success probability is almost half

231
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,820
but by using the 26 or to the 25 attacks

232
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,320
time complexity so the access

233
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,380
probability is almost one

234
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,459
okay so the possible counter major so

235
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:41,519
the issue is uh so the internal State

236
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,120
Recovery is possible but also the

237
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,459
so original local doesn't involve the

238
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,160
secret key here so even so after the

239
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,260
recovery is the C okay so that after

240
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,600
Secret After recovering the internal

241
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,940
state so it's a very easy to compute the

242
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,279
backward under that it gets a secret key

243
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,440
so this is the issue so we just involved

244
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,360
the secret key after the initialization

245
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,320
so we can embody data our attack and we

246
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,420
also recommend the secret key it should

247
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,579
be excelled before the finalizations

248
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,100
because those often Nan system is used

249
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,220
so about that is practical and it means

250
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,519
the financial misuse setting uh so the

251
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,420
local is

252
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:28,440
with practical time complexity so as we

253
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,480
we think as it's a not so good so that

254
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,260
we should recommend the secret key

255
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,899
excelling before as a finalization

256
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,779
okay so the another

257
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,779
um

258
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:47,279
so the original okay so the next topic

259
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,279
is this one 256 bit indistinguishability

260
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,180
security and 128 bits pack

261
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,779
so pick

262
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,779
okay so the originally local claims this

263
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,120
security unbalanced with security

264
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,600
but of course also we show the attack so

265
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,639
local neighbor satisfied the security

266
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,860
Graham of course so key recovery is uh

267
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,680
break everything but uh still the

268
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,899
following question is theoretical

269
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,019
interest so is

270
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:20,579
256-bit indistinguishability achievable

271
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:24,060
for any AED with relatively short 128

272
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,360
bit tax so that means that so it's

273
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,100
possible or not so the local claim it

274
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,220
but in general it's possible or not

275
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,860
so we think it's a very important

276
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,380
question because we are cryptographers

277
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,480
so that we know the security definition

278
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,519
very well but also maybe AED user never

279
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,519
never don't know there never know that

280
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,300
as such a security

281
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,820
consideration so they may truncate the

282
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,220
tag with that careful consideration so

283
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,440
because intuitively as a Target

284
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,839
orientation affects the 4G security so

285
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,720
that they maybe don't conscious the

286
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,639
indistinguishability security

287
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,360
so but and also the aedus and master

288
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,760
truncate due to the narrow boundaries

289
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,980
and storage restrictions so we want to

290
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,180
trunk it

291
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,120
so but uh can we truncate the tag of aad

292
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,660
visits too much impact on the

293
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,639
indistinguishability security so usually

294
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,339
so when we discuss the aead security so

295
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,860
that we sometimes use this unified as

296
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,079
security key so this is a security game

297
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,880
so the Dr is encryption Oracle and

298
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,220
decryption worker and the idea is that

299
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,380
on the boat and that's what we want to

300
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,180
distinguish two world

301
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,040
but of course the cell is a trivial

302
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,199
attacks because just the security to the

303
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,720
Declaration Oracle due to the tee times

304
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,899
so we always distinguish these two words

305
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,940
so the if we use this security

306
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,639
definition so we never we it's a

307
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,860
impossible to satisfy such unbarrassed

308
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,839
to beat the security

309
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,139
so another solution better we change the

310
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,320
security goals from unified security to

311
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,980
in the CCA then uh but uh

312
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,040
so it's a

313
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,720
impossible to achieve such a so umbrella

314
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,620
speech security so now we show the one

315
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,699
teachable result but uh

316
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:36,959
it's a not so practical so we need uh

317
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,959
each other is a TBC with a 256-bit input

318
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:45,420
256-bit output and the 256-speed tweaks

319
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,240
and the angry and we use the ends encode

320
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,420
and Cipher scheme so encryption is a

321
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,420
concatenation of the order to M and the

322
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,940
decoration after decrypting and we check

323
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,480
buoy is zero knots so this type aad so

324
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,880
that we can say 256 bit

325
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,920
indistinguishability security and but

326
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,380
for Journey Securities

327
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,199
so it's a possible but if we want to get

328
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,320
such unbalanced security we need this

329
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,139
this game is a country okay so that this

330
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,959
I concluded my talks so first I probably

331
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,420
proposed the attack

332
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,899
uh break the security uh recovery uh we

333
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,820
break the critical by security claim on

334
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,839
blocker and so

335
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,880
we also show the ability to the security

336
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,339
claim but uh includes the Sci-Fi is a

337
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,440
feasible solution but not so practical

338
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,360
so more practical solution is open

339
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,259
question okay thank you very much

340
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:46,100
foreign

341
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,859
are there any questions here in Kobe

342
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,220
there is one

343
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,280
give her a very nice talk so I have a

344
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,220
question about the definition of

345
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,540
non-swiss because I was my understanding

346
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,280
was at least for GCM for example people

347
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,439
only consider Notre using the encryption

348
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,839
but in the description was allowed so

349
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,199
the taroka is really fine not through

350
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,939
use or how is the definition exactly

351
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,660
so our attack doesn't reduce nouns to

352
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,400
the encryption rocker so uh

353
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,280
so we we don't sell the use the nouns to

354
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,520
the decision workers so that maybe

355
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,220
sorry so that I'm I'm not so perfectly

356
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,400
understand the question maybe so

357
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,900
but we can discuss offline it's okay

358
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,380
yeah

359
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,660
thank you just to comment uh for a

360
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,240
decryption Oracle we do reuse analysis

361
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,360
and we just assume that we can reuse the

362
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,360
nouns for the decryption Oracle and this

363
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,400
reflects the reality where the

364
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,880
decryption devices does not remember all

365
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,919
the past nonsense that have that it

366
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,960
received so I think it's a plausible

367
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,120
assumption that we can reuse the nouns

368
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,918
for the decryption Oracle

369
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,740
do you have any comments on

370
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,280
the problem with your tag is is really a

371
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,380
serious problem in practice I mean

372
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,700
because also for AGS 256 indeed the

373
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,679
designers also know this type of attack

374
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,039
but they said I mean because the

375
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,200
initialization is a key permutation so

376
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,700
it has no problem to recover the key

377
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,460
after the state is not

378
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,360
uh I mean in comments on like I mean

379
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,600
the the problem of short attack in

380
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,219
practice I mean yeah

381
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,780
yeah

382
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,919
so I think in yeah of course there's a

383
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,440
one

384
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,559
so it's a very difficult question so now

385
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,400
so the uh local want to design The Heist

386
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,400
little bit so the super high speed uh

387
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,280
aad then this around the function should

388
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,059
be sparse otherwise we can adjust we use

389
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,840
the sponge then we never get such a

390
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,020
super high speed uh so encryption then

391
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,720
maybe then social Finance is misused so

392
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,000
it's a bit difficult to avoid the state

393
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,520
recovery attack I think

394
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,919
that yeah

395
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,500
so

396
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,720
yeah I think this is this type counter

397
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,960
measure should be necessary so for uh

398
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,020
yeah so I think yes the current is the

399
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,059
it's a bad thing is that target language

400
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,179
is low as in security level so we can

401
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,640
break the security claim but also the

402
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,120
evil if the target is equal to the key

403
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,360
length so nouns misuse security is

404
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,780
something important in practice so I

405
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,820
think as this is just my comments so

406
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,799
that this uh this counter measure should

407
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,200
be necessary

408
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,419
thank you very much

409
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:19,799
okay

410
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,160
are those another question are there

411
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,179
some questions in painting

412
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,160
is there is none then let's thanks just

413
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,520
okay again

414
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,150
Beijing

415
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,329
[Music]

416
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,640
it's amazing

417
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,700
wow

418
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,440
okay so the second part of this session

419
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,960
will be on practical attacks and full-on

420
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,980
Fleet

421
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,240
by senpeng Wong Dengue Feng binhu jaguan

422
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,480
tyrongxi and the Turk will be given by

423
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,360
saying

424
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,340
essential for the introduction my name

425
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,280
is Jim Huang I'm honored to talk our

426
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,980
work by category takes on four round

427
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,820
three

428
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,400
my presentation includes the following

429
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,720
five parts

430
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,960
the first one

431
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,659
we will introduce the fridge

432
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,539
Fleet is an authenticate encryption

433
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,820
screen with both info to detoxing

434
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,220
imagine propose Styles eurocraft 2020

435
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,760
and the cool permutation used in fridge

436
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,360
is free the p is showing the right parts

437
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
and

438
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,880
the state size is four lamps and average

439
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,700
length is

440
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,320
128 meters

441
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,240
and the lamp

442
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,840
AP and CD

443
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,580
the Run function of uh

444
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,600
free to P will

445
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:05,520
it reach the Run function 24 numbers

446
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,039
and the Run function of field P has

447
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:11,520
slash web coding bathing property which

448
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,320
means that axle b x OB C equals D in

449
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,879
place that a average

450
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,140
xoc abstract equals d a absolutely

451
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,380
both will be detect if the armpits

452
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,700
doesn't have coding ability

453
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,500
property when the input state has

454
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,159
encoding a building property

455
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,480
uh we we know that the value of D can be

456
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,919
determined by a b and c thus if we

457
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,179
ignore the length t as

458
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,720
we will get a new uh permutation you

459
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,440
know denoted eyes free to PC and since

460
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,840
the distinguish for free to PC directly

461
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,500
translates to the distinguish for 3dp we

462
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,700
focus on uh

463
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,980
but the PC has

464
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,840
only four operations a rotation uh Excel

465
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,080
contains and and bitwise and is the only

466
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,340
non-layer operations

467
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:26,940
if we effectively and control the

468
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,460
proportation of difference on the layer

469
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,620
mask through video wires and operations

470
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,760
we can obtain peer of difference with

471
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,700
high probabilities and landmarks with

472
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,400
high correlations

473
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,240
the second we will give a differential

474
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,240
the changes for Forum free PC

475
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,900
because rotation XOXO constraints are

476
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,559
layer operations the different

477
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,320
differential property of related pair of

478
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,840
difference of weight it means that the

479
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,559
difference is not zero for the for this

480
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,679
layer operations is one

481
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,860
that's way only introduce the

482
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,840
differential property of and a life Z

483
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,299
equals X and B B and the function for

484
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,539
the input difference Alpha Beta of x y

485
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,900
and output different scam update then

486
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,720
the differential probability chemicality

487
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,960
as the following inclusions

488
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,919
uh for the first case if not Alpha and

489
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,940
not beta and the gamma equals 0 and 0

490
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,039
means that and is n bit Vector whose

491
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:47,279
average binary entries are other and in

492
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,760
this case the properties of our beta2

493
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,740
comma is negative of Hamming weight will

494
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,820
alpha or beta and power two

495
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,340
and that's the differential property of

496
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,740
a related pair of difference for bitwise

497
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,820
and operations is determining there by

498
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,799
the width of alpha orbital

499
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,620
by fixing the input difference of under

500
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:21,659
operations to zero we can have the

501
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,460
following limits

502
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,980
the differential property of difference

503
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,820
of a beta gamma to alpha alpha Trophy

504
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,220
and bit of trophy come up through for

505
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,240
the wrong function of freed PC is one if

506
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,820
and only if the following conditions are

507
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,299
satisfied

508
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,919
and for four round three PC we can

509
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,400
obtain a differential distinguish with

510
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,520
property one in order to have little to

511
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,940
understand the dating age and fighter

512
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:02,700
will show H in the red part of

513
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,039
and we can from the the distinguish you

514
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,260
can know that in the input difference

515
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,440
and the obstacle output difference are

516
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,460
the same is a iterative differential

517
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,400
distinguish and the input difference and

518
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,559
absolute difference of under

519
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,340
and the functions are older that means

520
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,000
that's the differential property is one

521
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,120
thus we can link

522
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,880
uh link this

523
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,299
one round the Renault distinguish uh one

524
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:42,500
by one and for any longer

525
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:48,419
free to PC we can give a differential uh

526
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,240
distinguish with property one

527
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,020
the second the third part is a layer

528
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,320
distinguished for four round print PC

529
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,760
similar to differential uh distinguish

530
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,380
because

531
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,179
this these three operations are all

532
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:08,820
layer operations so the layer

533
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,100
correlations of a valid pair of

534
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,039
landmarks for this operations is one or

535
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,980
not negative one

536
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,260
also the layer property Advanced is when

537
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,980
the offer and beta be the input a large

538
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,460
mask of x y and the gamma is a landmarks

539
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,400
of Z then the

540
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,100
black correlations of alpha beta and the

541
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,559
gamma is that if Gamma or not not Alpha

542
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,120
and not beta equals one

543
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
layer correlations is the negative I

544
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,120
mean width of gamma parallel two

545
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,200
otherwise the their

546
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,240
correlations is zero

547
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,179
that's uh we kind of guys in the layer

548
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,140
correlations of valid pair of landmarks

549
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:16,220
for bitwise operations is determined

550
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,039
determined by the out

551
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,700
output layer mask gamma

552
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,779
then we fix the output landmarks of and

553
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:31,020
operations to one we have the volume

554
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,020
levels

555
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,620
I like to talk in and talk out with the

556
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,860
input and output mask of the sron

557
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,940
function as the able to solutes value of

558
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,919
correlation and and talk is one event if

559
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,159
one only if the following conditions are

560
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:57,899
satisfied a coaching to level three we

561
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:00,659
will obtain a layer distinguish for

562
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:04,620
Forum free PC whose able solute value of

563
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,020
correlation says one we show The

564
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,179
Proposition always through one round

565
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:12,179
three PC in the red part similar to

566
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:15,539
differential distinguished the input and

567
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:20,220
output layer and masks are same and is

568
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,299
also a iterative large

569
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:28,679
it's English so we can extend it to any

570
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:31,799
round every PC

571
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:35,460
the first is practical it takes some

572
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,940
foreign

573
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,779
parts

574
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,120
Apple episode

575
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:56,820
Associated data Enclave encrypted

576
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,559
context and generate type and the Run

577
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,740
function f is the four round three HPC

578
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,840
and every input data was slapped into a

579
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,779
blocks of

580
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:17,039
120 each debitors and the last input

581
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,980
maybe short term I'll take key I will

582
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,140
serve key as example

583
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,919
a is is

584
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,179
128 meters

585
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,179
vector

586
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,159
uh who's every binary interests are out

587
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,960
there into the

588
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,179
uh

589
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:57,000
the whole vectors

590
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,100
uh belong to uh to uh three labs and uh

591
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,520
because the differential property of

592
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,159
this dating is over the four round three

593
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:17,059
to PC uh in the picture is f uh it's R1

594
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:20,159
last we can introduce difference into

595
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,640
key non-associated data and plain text

596
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,480
for example if we intro insert a

597
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,380
difference into the non-zero

598
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,919
and if after age we didn't introduce any

599
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:39,779
distinguish the

600
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:43,200
internal the difference of the internal

601
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,200
space will be all the same because the

602
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,260
dimensional property is one last away

603
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,399
time

604
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,600
guides related sabotage and really in

605
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,360
the type from the difference

606
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,480
last uh

607
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,760
that's this breaks the columns for

608
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,380
integrity and configured negative four

609
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,240
phase a

610
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,880
conclusions and future work uh

611
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,740
differential and the large exit English

612
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,399
for four round three PCR purpose uh

613
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:21,559
there and there are some previous

614
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:25,320
English but they I think instructs the

615
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:30,260
security of uh Freight AE and our

616
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,980
distinguish will work for any wrongs

617
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,980
spray the PC that means that our

618
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,100
distinguish cannot

619
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,580
be avoid by adding and the wrong number

620
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:50,340
of reader and free PC is a structure uh

621
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,440
distinguish

622
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,039
and using the differential distinguish

623
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:00,179
with property one with I algorithm which

624
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,880
can generate a search consisting of

625
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,519
value tax and simple texts which are not

626
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,339
created by legal users this breaks the

627
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,040
integrity and configure and then show

628
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,879
the security current of 3D

629
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,639
future work our takes in this favorite

630
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,639
thing doesn't

631
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:23,239
recover the secret security

632
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,719
how to give a key you cover your teeth

633
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,940
and it's further research thanks for

634
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,599
your attention

635
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:41,580
for your talk are there any questions in

636
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,060
Beijing

637
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,770
yeah serious question

638
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,829
[Music]

639
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:56,280
this is your interesting talk and do you

640
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,880
have some suggestion to repair the fly a

641
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,300
big

642
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,960
uh oh

643
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,839
sorry

644
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,020
uh wishing that a way I'd a rotation

645
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,579
operation uh

646
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,300
after the wrong functions

647
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,119
of the four lines if we for example if

648
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,800
we rotation the four lamps and to the

649
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,140
left or right I

650
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,380
I because

651
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,460
and the

652
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,400
the largest English and uh

653
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,800
differential distinguish

654
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,760
will not be a type integrative

655
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,300
distinguish we think this may be uh

656
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,460
divide our attack

657
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,359
okay thank you

658
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,060
are there any other questions in Beijing

659
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,220
any questions in Quebec

660
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,740
I have one question yeah go ahead uh

661
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,619
thanks for your interest in talk so

662
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:19,800
indeed after our first read your talk as

663
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,500
soon I mean my work on low MC came to my

664
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,780
mind because after seeing the structure

665
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,780
of the this cipheroids just like a

666
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,700
partial non-linear layer right

667
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,240
the I mean there are many rotations and

668
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,599
the shifts like eight XO we can just use

669
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:39,800
it as a very large uh

670
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,800
linear transform it's a matrix then we

671
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,480
only the

672
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,540
that only I cannot remember the size of

673
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,200
a so only a part part of the state goes

674
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,680
through the internal uh the Xbox then we

675
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,500
compute then for example if we consider

676
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,720
mainly uh like what

677
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,859
malicious low MC I mean the back doors

678
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:08,220
like low MCM they indeed construct uh

679
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,420
like a weak Matrix this such that a

680
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,200
difference can preserve for a long runs

681
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,040
I mean I think this is I think this main

682
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,040
problem is caused by the

683
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,480
I mean

684
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,839
it is that the linear layer is

685
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:30,119
decomposed in many many some patients

686
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,220
like this how you consider to you to

687
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,040
this still interpret your attack with an

688
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,859
LG brick perspective I think I think it

689
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:39,980
is easy because you just

690
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,000
if you know some attacks online

691
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:49,160
sorry I

692
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:52,619
Okay so

693
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:56,400
so how Okay uh I think the question was

694
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,260
whether or this could be applied to

695
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,839
other ciphers with a partial nonlinear

696
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,540
layer

697
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:07,260
the story items guys y'all

698
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,079
your questions

699
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,420
so with this kind of techniques be

700
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,640
applicable to other ciphers with partial

701
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,119
non-linear layers such as low NC and in

702
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,339
some cases some backyard

703
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,240
safer where

704
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,880
I mean so my main problem is here you

705
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,339
can just say this is indeed a partial

706
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,020
non-linear construction you can see

707
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,220
right

708
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,859
uh is it right the personal linear I

709
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:37,020
mean only partial partial state is

710
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,720
updated by the Xbox you can see the end

711
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,780
operation as the non-linear operation so

712
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,780
and the remaining B and this is just

713
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,540
passing through directly they did not go

714
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,359
through the

715
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:53,280
non-linear operation then for example if

716
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,800
we use the LGB technique as my crypto

717
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,040
paper we can construct I mean to

718
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,200
construct a probability one uh

719
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,000
differential Trail we can only ensure

720
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,980
the difference to the non-linear

721
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,800
operation is always zero for example for

722
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,920
this construction we need to add uh for

723
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,020
example for the first one we need to add

724
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,839
suppose the lens of a is n we need to

725
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,880
add two n equations

726
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,040
uh and then in the second round we need

727
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,839
to add to any questions so now we have

728
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,300
four n equations but in this there are

729
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,820
only three and variables in so ideally

730
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,880
there should be no such a solution to

731
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,280
this equation system but now there is

732
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,280
the main problem is I mean it's the

733
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,560
the the the the

734
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,680
weakness of the linear layer and this is

735
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,680
indeed what is used in the malicious

736
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,800
looms I mean low MCM in their

737
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,800
construction maybe if you I'm not sure

738
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,660
you are familiar with this line of

739
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,078
research

740
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,200
I think that's the

741
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,900
the the the

742
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:10,740
distinguish exists I mean that

743
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,740
um

744
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:18,079
the lamp B and C and

745
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,859
in the lamp a b and c and they should

746
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:27,119
they should satisfy the uh this will

747
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,359
satisfy the coding obeying property so

748
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:33,560
and this is

749
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:39,060
keeps this property maybe uh some weeks

750
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,220
and some weeks

751
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,820
exist so uh

752
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,820
if

753
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,300
if we

754
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,820
change the structure we have to keep

755
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,480
this coding invading

756
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,560
obeying property so

757
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,320
um

758
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,280
if there are other

759
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,900
better

760
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:14,119
structure if this and is

761
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,560
it's a question and

762
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,859
we cannot guarantee that if we

763
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,619
change the structure is is motive or and

764
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:36,780
have code Albanian property so um

765
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:41,339
it needs of other research I think

766
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:44,579
thank you for your answer

767
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:49,520
okay is there any one last question

768
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,680
foreign

769
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,520
the restock of this session is

770
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,140
revisiting the extension of Matrix

771
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,300
algorithm 1 to linear health application

772
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:17,579
to Tiny jumbo by Muse attack

773
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,619
for the introduction good morning

774
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:25,440
everyone it's an honor for me to present

775
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,560
our people here our work revelated the

776
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,020
extension of Mother's algorithm 1 to

777
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,720
linear horse and we applied it to Tony

778
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,040
Jambu Auto from this file aspects

779
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,500
at first let's see our motivation and

780
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,819
contribution

781
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,520
linear credit analysis was originally

782
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,099
proposed by Missouri

783
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,800
a strong linear approximation with high

784
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,160
pollution in this form is often used

785
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,760
with this relation Muslim proposed two

786
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,700
different algorithms to recover KBS

787
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,240
however both algorithms rely on their

788
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,079
assuming that only one strong field is

789
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:10,460
contained in this linear heart

790
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,220
extended algorithm one as we all know

791
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,440
the correlation of the linear actually

792
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,380
varies with our keys so the whole key

793
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,599
space can be divided into several

794
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:28,560
different key classes so when we after

795
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,060
we cracked earn data encrypted under the

796
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,400
unknown red key one can use a designer

797
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,760
function data to to make a to decide

798
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,040
which key class the red one lasting

799
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,579
however Turtle may make mistakes so uh

800
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:48,000
the relation between data and the number

801
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,940
of data complexity and and Alpha

802
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,180
probability VP should be replicated

803
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,880
accurately however there is their

804
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,880
experiments show that this is not the

805
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,079
case

806
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:04,079
we Revisited their work and found that

807
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,480
such in accuracy comes from their

808
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,240
methodology of this tune of reducing

809
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,500
this relation

810
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,680
besides for servers we are only part of

811
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,079
the States can be obtained algorithm

812
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,720
reminds seem to be more syllables than

813
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,079
algorithm 2. so we are motivated to

814
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,900
study the extension of Missouri's

815
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,880
algorithm 1.

816
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,380
in our work we adopted a new methodology

817
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,319
with our new methodology we can reduce

818
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:38,099
this absolute error into at most two

819
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:40,740
percent while in previous is more than

820
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,859
90 percent with our new 30 critical

821
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:46,740
models we Mount key recovery attacks on

822
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,500
Tiny Jambu tanjambu were designed by Wu

823
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,079
and Huang before our key recovery attack

824
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,839
there is only one key recovery attack

825
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:57,180
proposed by turn at all

826
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,000
however their work their attack only

827
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,260
works for the first version and keep it

828
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,920
128 and only 1K beat has been recovered

829
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,819
with our methods we can recover we can

830
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:15,420
recover and most uh we with our method

831
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,599
we can recover at least 7 kbps and our

832
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:21,260
work can be suitable for all King leases

833
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,300
so our work are the first private

834
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,579
analysis results in the non-respecting

835
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,859
sizing on the full tangent movie one

836
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:32,520
another one reduced 10 gem blue V2

837
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,880
okay firstly okay let's briefly recall

838
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,220
the previous extension of mazuri's

839
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,200
algorithm 1.

840
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,900
as I have just mentioned the key space

841
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,540
can be divided into several disjoint key

842
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,339
classes according to their correlation

843
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:49,460
with linear ha

844
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,560
assuming their red key star belongs to

845
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,819
the GSK class then after we collect

846
00:46:55,819 --> 00:46:59,520
after we collect earn data encrypted

847
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,280
under this red key we can compute the

848
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,460
value of the 33t and then we use the

849
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,460
design function data to the to make

850
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,900
decisions

851
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,660
the arrow probability the arrow

852
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,240
probability p i g denotes the

853
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,260
probability that when the red key class

854
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:22,619
is the GSK class further third function

855
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:24,119
chooses I

856
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:27,420
so by summing all these phds together we

857
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,420
can get the 22 Arrow probability when

858
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,260
the GC class is the red class

859
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,359
2 theoretically evaluation local network

860
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:43,220
proposed PE which is the average

861
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:46,619
error probability overall cubes and our

862
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:49,680
final total Arrow probability to mount

863
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,140
valid attacks the relation between and

864
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,619
PE should be deprecated accurately

865
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:59,099
okay let's see Zero methodology given

866
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:03,359
this rpe we assume that for each I and g

867
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,819
t i g are equals

868
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:09,900
R equals to this value so uh denote

869
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,839
the data complexity needed in making

870
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:16,560
decisions between TI and qg then they

871
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,079
can construct the relation between p i g

872
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:22,020
and with their statistical models

873
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:25,200
finally the data complexity on is

874
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,660
evaluated at the upper bonds of all

875
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,760
these nigs

876
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,460
one can see that these two places makes

877
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,420
the methodology in accurate

878
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,520
in their work sleep propose three

879
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,380
different attack settings

880
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,660
the director text citing is the

881
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,359
aforementioned one where the keys base

882
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,400
is divided according to each coverage

883
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,960
correlation

884
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,020
inner basically related key searching or

885
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,260
fixed key difference Alpha is chosen so

886
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,400
in this case

887
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,400
the key space can be divided according

888
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,800
to the differences between correlations

889
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,819
evaluated under this related keepers

890
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:07,920
in this case small key bits can be

891
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,180
recovered

892
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,460
in the multiple related key searching

893
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,400
key differences which form our best are

894
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,359
chosen

895
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,920
for each

896
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,220
difference we proceeded the basically

897
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,619
check and then we can obtain Our Guest

898
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:25,319
key classes so if all these objects

899
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:28,200
succeed the red PP star must belong to

900
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,599
the intersection of all these key

901
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:31,800
classes

902
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,839
in this case small key bits can be

903
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,359
recovered

904
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:39,480
now let's see our new methodology and

905
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,940
statistical models

906
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,520
in our work we adopt the following

907
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,819
methodology for each G we dedicate

908
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:51,420
clearly the distribution PG of T related

909
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,240
to n when the red key star belongs to

910
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,540
the GC class then we can compute Pig

911
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,119
with the CDF of DG and the return

912
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:01,619
function

913
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:04,500
as another decision rule of their data

914
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,980
function so the final total error Arrow

915
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,839
probability P can be evaluated as this

916
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:16,319
let's take the stress hold basis model

917
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,780
in the direct objective sizing as an

918
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,020
example let's earn zero key records

919
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,000
hormone X full Fielder linear heart

920
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,500
given unknown data X so this statistic t

921
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,079
as we all know it follows the normal

922
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:33,060
distribution DG

923
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:37,140
which is related to the red key class G

924
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,660
B is the constant determined by whether

925
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:44,099
KP sampling or dkp sampling are adopted

926
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:46,859
our threshold based design function dot

927
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:49,619
T works as follows at first we should

928
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,480
solved all these possible correlations

929
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,920
CI in ascending orders so 30 will output

930
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,099
I if it locates in this interval and

931
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:03,119
output 0 here and output M plus 1 here

932
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,079
so let's see how to compute Pig

933
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:10,380
according to the definition of p i g

934
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,339
T follows from the this distribution DG

935
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:17,579
and Authority will output I so T Locus

936
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:20,880
in this interval so this probability can

937
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,619
be evaluated by CDF

938
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,240
we made a we made experimental

939
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,880
verifications of this threshold based

940
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,160
models in our experiments we use

941
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,900
256 wrong skin fermentation of tanning

942
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,200
Jambu and the linear highus is this one

943
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,119
it contains four different fields

944
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:44,700
involving different key bits and this

945
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,859
has different correlations

946
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:50,160
that AK denotes their xorr value of

947
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,319
these key bits then the whole key space

948
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,819
can be represented as these three bits

949
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:58,500
so according to its different

950
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,740
correlation we can divide this kick

951
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,740
space into four different key classes

952
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,500
so key information can then be recovered

953
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,079
using our statistical models

954
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,900
from these two from the top figure one

955
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,540
can see that our our experimental PE

956
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:22,559
confirm our thrust theoretical PE most

957
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,619
notably our threshold based models the

958
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:28,380
absolute for our threshold-based models

959
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,839
the absolute Arrow between these two

960
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,720
values is almost is about two percent

961
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,960
well in the previous MRE based model is

962
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,900
more than 90 percent

963
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,440
the MRE based statistic models can be

964
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,079
constructed in a similarly in this talk

965
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,440
let's let's focus on the one constructed

966
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,960
folder director text section and we only

967
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,440
consider KP sampling in this talk

968
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,900
the third function 30 will either

969
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,720
additional function dot T will outputs I

970
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,200
if and only if this inequality holds for

971
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,460
any T that's not equal to I mro denotes

972
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,040
the maximum maximum likelihood function

973
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,119
for t

974
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:16,079
so for each T we can get its info by

975
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,900
intersecting all the intervals together

976
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,420
one can get the final readable when

977
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,839
third output side so in this case P IG

978
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:30,619
can be computed using the CDF of t

979
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:34,079
we also made experimental verifications

980
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,260
on this mrebs models from these two

981
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,079
figures one can see that our re-based

982
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,619
models can reduce the error probability

983
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:47,400
into a multi can reduce the absolute

984
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,740
error between these two values into

985
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,180
almost two percent compared with our

986
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,920
threshold-based models is slightly more

987
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,760
pressed but much slower to compute

988
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,220
okay let's see our application on

989
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,040
tanning Jambu

990
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:08,160
tanjanbu is an EAD designed by U and

991
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,980
Huang it supports three different key

992
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,319
types

993
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:16,260
in Insurance a key permutation PB is

994
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,339
used PB will shift all this 128 bits

995
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:22,559
states to the right and their most

996
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,920
significant PhD can be computed as it's

997
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,220
know that there's one key bit involved

998
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,680
in our work we will focus on the last

999
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,319
permutation of the Final finalization

1000
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:35,880
Phase

1001
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,700
uh in this in this error one equals to

1002
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:44,960
384 84 in the first version where it's

1003
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,520
1640 in the second version

1004
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,099
in our work we will try to find linear

1005
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:52,319
holds containing bits only involved in

1006
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,859
this t0 and T1 and try to recover some

1007
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,960
key bits

1008
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,839
at first let's see how to evaluate the

1009
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,420
correlation of a linear view for time

1010
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:06,839
engine boot this figure shows Once one

1011
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:09,720
one updates other states

1012
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,780
this blue symbols denotes one bit mask

1013
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:16,020
values since there is only one and case

1014
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:19,500
so the relation between this mask values

1015
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,480
can be easily constructed

1016
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,980
so the R12 masks in each one is fixed so

1017
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:29,819
100 long term reference resists true

1018
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:33,300
into the xor value of this

1019
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,680
equations

1020
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:39,900
we proved that it equals to 15 to the

1021
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:44,339
xor value of 15 distinct FS

1022
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:47,880
all of us have this form this similar

1023
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,660
form

1024
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:52,260
note that in others these and kids may

1025
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,180
be changed together since

1026
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,819
these mask values can be one

1027
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:59,520
so FS contains several boiling functions

1028
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,040
which

1029
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,440
so the correlation evaluation of the

1030
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,079
linear view is equivalent to evaluating

1031
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:09,780
the correlation of these effects

1032
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,119
and the recording this procedure is to

1033
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,300
evaluate the correlation of f know that

1034
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,780
f is a chain and gets

1035
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,760
and it has an

1036
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,760
alternate

1037
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:27,000
the relation between n and the and its

1038
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,160
absolute correlation has been

1039
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,980
constructed by someone else since in our

1040
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,099
case we have to know its Sun so we

1041
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:37,260
follow a similar procedure and get the

1042
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,720
following relation

1043
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,540
no such way how to also have to know

1044
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,400
which key bits are involved in the

1045
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,920
linear field so the relation can be

1046
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,520
constructed

1047
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,440
Tucson all trails in their given in a

1048
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,440
hallway adopted a common procedure

1049
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,520
at first we built a MRP model M

1050
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,260
searching for one linear queue with our

1051
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:05,160
ammo minimizing the active analogies

1052
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,300
if we get a solution we can

1053
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,800
re-evaluate its correlation using these

1054
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,819
two

1055
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:14,640
using these two conclusions

1056
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,579
so if correlation of this Trio is not

1057
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:20,460
zero we will add it to a list meanwhile

1058
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:23,460
we will add extra constraints to remove

1059
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,180
the solution Sigma out of the

1060
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,240
a solution such a one

1061
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,680
finally we can get all fields

1062
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,680
with the with this procedure

1063
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,099
we found a 394 run linear half of 10

1064
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:44,760
engine Boo and it contains 850 trills

1065
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,180
details of this skills correlation of

1066
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:52,200
these tools are detailed in this table

1067
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:56,520
with this 394 linear Hub which amounts

1068
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:00,720
key recovery attacks on photon V1

1069
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:06,300
know that we can recover a 7 to 5 to 14K

1070
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,780
bits

1071
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:13,740
uh in the the inner design document the

1072
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:17,160
designers claim data elements which is

1073
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,380
the number of texts collected per key

1074
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,260
should be less than two to the power 47.

1075
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:25,859
through our working this data limits we

1076
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:28,319
adopted a weak key multi user side team

1077
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:31,260
in this setting we collect texts from

1078
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,900
multiple users and each user will have

1079
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,720
their own key but with zombies in common

1080
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,859
if we ignore this data limits all our

1081
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:42,660
checks can be suitable for all kind

1082
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,640
lessons

1083
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:48,240
okay let's conclude our talk

1084
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,640
in our paper we propose the new

1085
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,099
statistic models based on a new

1086
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:55,079
methodology

1087
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:59,520
our newster models improve improve their

1088
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,319
accuracy

1089
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:04,559
with these statistic models we mounted

1090
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,680
partial key recovery attacks on the full

1091
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,799
and jumbo V1 and around radius V2 in our

1092
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,520
respecting searching in filter we aim to

1093
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,460
find further applications of our models

1094
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,980
and try to investigate whether different

1095
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,579
masks can recover more KBs

1096
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:25,920
okay thanks for your attention and in

1097
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,160
questions

1098
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,119
thanks Miss who for your nice talk are

1099
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:39,260
there any questions in Beijing

1100
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,900
if there is none then are there any

1101
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,680
questions in Kobe

1102
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:56,400
so then I have one question when you

1103
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,020
talk in your conclusions about further

1104
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:00,780
applications you have

1105
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:04,339
anything concrete in mind

1106
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:10,799
uh sorry you mean why I chose as On

1107
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:11,640
Target

1108
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,579
on the if you have further applications

1109
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:18,380
possible what are they

1110
01:00:20,839 --> 01:00:24,839
uh sorry I didn't quite understand your

1111
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:25,680
question

1112
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,520
so you you say you you you will seek

1113
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,859
further applications for your models and

1114
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:34,079
the question is do you have already a

1115
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,260
concrete Target that you uh want to

1116
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,579
focus

1117
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:42,079
okay no other uh no other concrete

1118
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,160
ciphers so far

1119
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,660
okay thank you

1120
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:52,559
thank you another another question

1121
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,619
so if there is another question then

1122
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:57,540
let's thanks hope and all the speaker of

1123
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,400
this session again

1124
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,880
thank you
