1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,720
uh

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,460
so

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,680
so this is the last session of this

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,980
conference new constructions too and

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,099
this station has two talks and the first

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,039
one is chosen key secure even monster

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,800
Cipher from a single permutation by

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,880
and chungu and chanjiofu will give a

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,320
talk

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,900
okay thank you

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,260
hello everyone my name is Sanjay Shu our

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,300
topic is chosen key security

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,578
um Cipher from a single pump station

14
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,780
is to construct a security block Cipher

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,600
from Taylor's competitions a natural

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,079
solution is iterated humanzos scheme we

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,320
call it I am for short I am yours and

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,620
this block cyber by iterating r1k and

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,579
some competitions

20
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,159
that has been used by several standards

21
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,740
the same interpretations are public and

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,560
random

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,840
various of this scheme probably a few

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,080
various security Notions

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,180
including increasability

26
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,460
related case security knowing case

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,619
security chosen case Security in the

28
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,180
sensor correlation interactivity and

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,020
indifferential ability

30
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,680
we focus on the individuality of I am

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,939
okay

32
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,939
in society teaching visuality is trying

33
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,479
to distinguish the real world and Ideal

34
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,240
World which means teaching visual is

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,860
trying to distinguish the IM

36
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,460
construction from a random computation

37
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,700
in the real world the integration has

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,000
has Oracle exercise to IEM construction

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,420
and it also has access to each internal

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,960
computations used in our Construction

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,600
in the ideal world the IM construction

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,080
is replaced by an idea block Cipher and

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,420
to have the same interface in our

44
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,920
Construction

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,340
we need a simulator the simulator has

46
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,340
access to Ideal product server and

47
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,020
with random computation

48
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,020
this property implies the IM Cipher

49
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,180
influence or ideal Cipher properties

50
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,640
defined by single stage security teams

51
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,860
including

52
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,319
security against the related K and the

53
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,420
chosen kick attacks

54
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,280
okay

55
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,260
block Cipher in differential ability

56
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,540
analysis are typically lengthy and

57
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,679
require unnecessary constructions

58
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,599
and their influences are not as notable

59
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,540
as will applied to Hash function

60
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,239
to run the vehicle definitions have been

61
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,819
proposed

62
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:08,300
have been proposed in particular to

63
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,400
formalize choosing security the previous

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,099
work use the notion of correlation in

65
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,879
fact abilities

66
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,500
means that no choosing key or the rosary

67
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,959
confounded input output of the block

68
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,300
server satisfied in musical relations

69
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,980
the solution is again only achievable by

70
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,220
ideal model beside the block Cipher

71
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,879
to establish CI in the idea model we

72
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,099
consider the distinguisher in sequential

73
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,840
it is called the screenshot in

74
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,580
differential ability

75
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,280
okay and there is a instructor

76
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,040
uh clear order of this ingredient to be

77
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,519
primitive constructing screenshot

78
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,980
in the first step teaching visual

79
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,099
queries internal implementations and

80
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,680
Simulator the Green Arrow shows this

81
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,360
step

82
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,239
in the second step

83
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,060
it occurs the IM construction and the

84
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,280
ideal block Cipher e

85
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,980
in in this situation the distribution

86
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,680
could not do any more queries with three

87
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,978
hours because we respect the pre-order

88
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,380
or distinguisher to the Primitive

89
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,579
constructing screenshot

90
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,440
of course it is weak then

91
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,900
a few in differentiability

92
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,660
the sequential individuality notion has

93
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,600
the advantage of being simple and easier

94
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,479
to use in the post but it is just wrong

95
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,280
to implement correlation interact

96
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,660
availability

97
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,680
okay

98
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,380
besides initial positive result on the

99
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,139
general IM model another attractive line

100
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,139
of work has been since

101
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:57,479
3264 minimizing IM Cipher for certain

102
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,240
security properties

103
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,580
in the previous work the single key

104
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,860
elements so we are in the emip without

105
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,960
any non-travel key schedule was about

106
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,820
the screenshot in differentiability at

107
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,380
four runs

108
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,900
an iPhone next step is to investigate

109
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,160
the wider screenshot in

110
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,680
differentiability is achievable using a

111
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,720
single computation

112
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,020
unfortunately in another our work during

113
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,180
the week model of sequential in

114
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,880
differentiability is a single key single

115
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,280
permutation human so we are in the emsp

116
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,340
remains insecure regardless of the

117
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,280
number of runs and currently we found an

118
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,280
attack that Nick just run permutation

119
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,820
query and one interrupting period Intel

120
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,880
first the distinguation quiz PS to get Y

121
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,320
and let K be equal to X X or Y so U is

122
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,860
equal to Y and V is equal to X

123
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,160
so in the emsp construction a single

124
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,699
input output pair of the permutation

125
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:04,080
already use a 50 rounded emsp

126
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,479
in our negative results

127
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,120
to achieve security one must enhance

128
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,900
program emsp by using an open key

129
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,979
schedule

130
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:18,000
okay in this work we often

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
communication 5 can be a linear or

132
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
summer season or secondly shaped

133
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,460
we call this EMS mirroring the EMS key

134
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,720
file

135
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,720
next is our main work we produce the EMS

136
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,940
key file with a single permutation or

137
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,280
chosen notion uh screenshot in

138
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,139
differentiability

139
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,280
and it is the minimal

140
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,299
IM solution scheme

141
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,880
in general to establish individual

142
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,039
ability type security

143
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,020
the first step is to construct a

144
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,440
simulator that resist a barriers attack

145
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,180
then it remains to argue that the

146
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,580
simulated intentional and the simulator

147
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,919
gives regards to an ideal what the data

148
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,720
is indisting principle from The Real

149
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,479
World so the question is how do we build

150
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,880
a simulator

151
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,699
we use the chain complete technique it

152
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,100
requires the simulator to detect partial

153
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,380
chains formed by the previous of the

154
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,560
distinguisher and complete change in

155
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,479
advance

156
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,419
to simulate answers that are consistent

157
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,940
with random computation the simulator

158
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,940
must use the answers from Plantation to

159
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,580
Define some simulated answers this

160
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,919
action is called adaptation

161
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,340
this is a cool idea of our simulator is

162
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,020
internal values are secret and random

163
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,020
okay as shown in this picture

164
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,380
it is a solution-led simulator must

165
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,380
attack when decrease PX the simulator

166
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,539
Force the chicks whether it can form a

167
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,880
three chain

168
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,639
in this recent the first two rounds are

169
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,620
read across already storied in the

170
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,080
simulators table and this is the query

171
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,240
can be linked exactly as the server

172
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,840
round on the all right if a solution is

173
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,539
formed then the simulator completes a

174
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,080
function of EMS file in advance

175
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,660
firstly the simulator computes the

176
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,940
required around the K besides on the

177
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,500
three chain

178
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,580
and X4 X4 can be obtained then the

179
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,099
querying idea of the cipher and simple

180
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,219
connotation to obtain y4 so we can get a

181
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,000
14 or emsp5 where

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,520
as for rifle is called the adaptation

183
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,740
record

184
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,979
okay 20 curves p in the opposite

185
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,020
direction the simulator also needs to

186
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,060
check why there is a solution is formed

187
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,940
in this solution the last rounds are

188
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,100
records already storied in the simulator

189
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,160
table and the latest query can be linked

190
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,700
exactly at the first round on the left

191
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,040
if a switching is formed

192
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,019
then the simulator also needs to

193
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,320
complete calculate a blockchain in

194
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,480
advance

195
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,899
okay it is like the various switching

196
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,779
case but in the opposite direction

197
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,820
firstly the simulator computes the

198
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,620
required around okay beside on the

199
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,220
situation and Learn by creating ideal

200
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,620
block server and simple documentation to

201
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,779
open X1 y1

202
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:31,200
so we can get a function of emsg5 where

203
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,180
X1 y1 is an adaptation record

204
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,240
after completing the solution change the

205
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,160
simulator also needs to check the two

206
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,920
chain when D equals PX the simulator

207
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,140
takes the two chain in this picture

208
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,140
in this two chains the first round is

209
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,180
unrecorded already storied in the

210
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,420
simulators table and of course the

211
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,180
latest query can form a switching with

212
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,060
all various records in this case the

213
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,760
latest query is to the red of the

214
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,380
previous record

215
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,779
if a switching is formed using the

216
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:11,160
simulator completes a 14 or EMS key file

217
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,200
in advance

218
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,560
okay firstly the simulator computes the

219
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
required around the K design on the two

220
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,660
chain secondly the simulator internally

221
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,620
query P to open X4 y4 these values are

222
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,959
secured and one second Android

223
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,040
immediately so this internal query want

224
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,060
to trigger a new simulator Circle

225
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,580
in ideal block Cipher and the simple

226
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,700
commutation to obtain X1 y1 so we can

227
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,420
get a function of EMS Q5 with xyy1 is an

228
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,199
adapting record

229
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,480
similarly when equals p in the opposite

230
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,880
direction the simulator also needs to

231
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,220
change equalizer the two chain is formed

232
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,680
in this solution the last round is a

233
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,899
record already storied in the simulators

234
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,620
table and the latest query is to the

235
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,899
left of the previous records record

236
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,120
okay it is like the previous three

237
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,820
changes but in the opposite direction

238
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,600
the simulator internet explanation X1 y1

239
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,959
and S4 rifle is

240
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,959
record

241
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,760
okay

242
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,940
after after introducing the simulator we

243
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,640
simplify the progressive Model E is an

244
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,279
ideal product Cipher as is a simulator

245
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,380
and the p is the communication with end

246
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,360
date so the question is how to get

247
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,399
distance between ideal world and the

248
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,740
real world

249
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,320
basic remains to establish two claims

250
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,200
for any distinguisher d particularly the

251
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,079
simulator has advanced in the complexity

252
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:54,060
secondly the ideal world and the real

253
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,880
world are indistinguishable

254
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,820
to this end we use a introduce intro

255
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,160
media system in this system the

256
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,079
simulator has

257
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,839
Oracle exercise to e and P a

258
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,740
distinguisher quiz simulator and emsp5

259
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,459
with Oracle anesthetics user simulator

260
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,399
so cutting cutting two times between

261
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,500
audio world and the real world can be

262
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,540
two steps

263
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,120
the first considerations between ideal

264
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,060
world and the intermediate system

265
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,700
we can see that a distinguisher for the

266
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,220
previous simulator with Oracle access to

267
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,959
p and E

268
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,740
if the pair EP is good the answers the

269
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,899
integration result are

270
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,899
uh I've been called posting audio world

271
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,540
and the intro media system

272
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,000
on the left side e is an idea block

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,060
Cipher and the emsg5 is a real structure

274
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,459
so the difference between audio world

275
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,500
and the intermediate system depends on

276
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,060
the implementation p

277
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:00,420
and that's what we consider the

278
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,160
difference between intermediate system

279
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,959
and the real world

280
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,680
notice that real world only has access

281
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,200
to the computation P so the situation is

282
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,060
different the most important thing is

283
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,060
how to change the pair EP 2p

284
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,720
so we use the randomness map install it

285
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,360
personally we Define a member Lambda the

286
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,300
map Lambda is defined for any pairs EP

287
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,980
as follows

288
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,040
okay run p and consider the table of the

289
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
simulator at the end of the execution

290
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,459
then fill all on different injuries into

291
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,440
the table with very simple

292
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,019
if the pair EP is good the simulator

293
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,600
never overrides an entry into the table

294
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,360
in other words a partial fermentation

295
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,399
plan is good if it has a good

296
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,560
pre-imageable Lambda

297
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,820
secondly

298
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,519
we see that uh competition P it contains

299
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,500
a partial implementation Pi if it's a

300
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,560
recording on all increase

301
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,380
okay by definition of the random

302
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,060
instrumenting if the partial

303
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,220
fermentation Pi is good the other pose

304
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,139
or intermediate system and the real

305
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,660
world are equal for any pair EP so we

306
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,120
can use the prior permutation to find

307
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,639
out the distance between intermediate

308
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,200
system and the real world

309
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,579
award and the real world

310
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,339
so we finished the pro of the sequential

311
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,339
individual ability or

312
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:32,579
EMS keys by with a single computation

313
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,940
the previous research stopped at using

314
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,920
independent permutations

315
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,440
but there is a gap between such result

316
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,100
and popular senders this work May bridge

317
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,940
this Gap also it is the first

318
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,100
individuality type security for block

319
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,300
servers using identical run functions

320
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,820
finally we have a summary of our work

321
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,399
and the previous works

322
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,019
it shows that the number of Primitives

323
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:06,240
key scheme simulator complexity and

324
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,579
Security Bank of our work and various

325
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,260
works

326
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,319
thank you for listening and any question

327
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,740
thank you for a nice talk so are there

328
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,180
any questions in Beijing

329
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,060
no questions amazing there is a question

330
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,639
in Beijing

331
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,040
a thanks for your interest in talking I

332
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,980
have a question uh you discussed four

333
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,920
rounds of ieim which uses a single

334
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,500
computation have you ever considered

335
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,560
reducing the number of rounds say three

336
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,380
rounds of IIM thank you

337
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,060
you mean

338
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,880
three run I am yeah

339
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,040
okay

340
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,820
uh

341
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,760
okay in this table the progress will

342
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,980
work through the

343
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:08,220
e m KD is credential individuality

344
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,180
but dear

345
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,240
scheme is a random Oracle

346
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,300
okay so as we actually consider three

347
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,639
rounds I am at first but

348
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,519
uh found some negative results

349
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,699
we found an attack that can be applied

350
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:31,380
to surround I am with without any long

351
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,880
travel case together without no yeah and

352
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,660
this result is shown in our in our paper

353
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,120
okay okay

354
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,880
uh did you design a block Cipher based

355
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,420
on your results of your work

356
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,420
applications

357
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:56,519
no no no this work is a mainly focused

358
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,620
on the

359
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,380
iron security real world applications

360
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,839
are future work

361
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,640
okay thank you okay thank you

362
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,938
are there any other questions in Beijing

363
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:25,819
uh you have questions

364
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,340
for your presentation

365
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,740
I have a question

366
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,960
whether a screen touring different

367
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,960
ability impact correlation

368
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,960
interpreting

369
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,980
correlation in fact ability you mean oh

370
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,460
okay okay

371
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
correlation in fact uh politicians that

372
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,360
uh black Cipher has a negligible

373
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,820
probability of founding some immune

374
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,179
relations possessing the rule and other

375
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,720
Wars this is considering series the

376
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,900
spiritual individuality the sequential

377
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,900
distinguisher

378
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,860
counter distribution the real world from

379
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,580
the ideal world okay

380
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,620
okay yes thank you

381
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,280
you're welcome

382
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,039
so are there any questions from Kobe or

383
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,400
online

384
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,240
uh I was wondering that uh if you're

385
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,500
familiar with the uh

386
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:57,539
minimizing the two round tweakable

387
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,840
information uh was published in the

388
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,179
Asian crypto 2020 uh 2020 and he said it

389
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,900
they analyzed the two trickable

390
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,380
information ciphers with one permutation

391
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,380
and but they uses two harsh functions

392
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,440
and with uh with only one permutation I

393
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,679
think your works are kind of familiar so

394
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,460
have you ever done anything like that

395
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,780
for example the two rounds with one

396
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,000
permutation and with two hearts function

397
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,280
I think that could be a

398
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,720
kind of

399
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,260
yeah have you ever considered that

400
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,000
function yes the work in

401
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,900
in two in the Asian crypto at 2020 and

402
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,460
they

403
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,860
um you have done um

404
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,919
an analysis uh the security analysis in

405
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,799
two two round

406
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:59,220
uh checkable if a man song

407
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,740
and they are also used one permutation

408
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,460
you work with them

409
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,940
there's no such work for to run the even

410
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,940
mental it's not even mentioned but it's

411
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,640
tweakable information it's trickline

412
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,179
yeah

413
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,380
in this case okay thank you yes you are

414
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,500
welcome

415
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,020
uh so there may be other questions but I

416
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,240
think now is the time for the next talk

417
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,919
so anyways I'd like to thank you I think

418
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,460
thank you

419
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,580
and so

420
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,760
the next talk the last talk of this

421
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,160
conference is from Kobe

422
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,100
the title of the talk is generalized

423
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,620
pastel structures based on tweakable

424
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,600
block Cycles by casit

425
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,820
talk

426
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,740
thank you

427
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,039
oh

428
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,640
thank you for the introduction

429
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,280
my name is

430
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,500
I represent the generalized faster

431
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,679
structures based on Twitter box ciphers

432
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:39,020
this is a joint work with DC water

433
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,400
first I will talk about introduction

434
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,460
Brock Cipher is a good publication and

435
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,039
nothing from a key space and an innovate

436
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:53,400
space into an Elevate space

437
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,520
if we fix the key EK is a computation

438
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,799
over any bits

439
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,580
and it's called called the brokerance

440
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,960
we will write NBC for this processor

441
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,900
construction of a skewer block Cipher is

442
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,659
one of the most important problems in

443
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:16,080
SIM network cryptography

444
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,919
we consider the security of a block

445
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,880
cycle e as to the random computation and

446
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,960
a strong PRP

447
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,299
a PRP adversary is given Oracle access

448
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,960
to an encryption Oracle EK in the real

449
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,039
world

450
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,280
and it is given Oracle access to random

451
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,620
computation Pi in the ideal world

452
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,940
the goal of

453
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,720
growth adversary is to distinguish the

454
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,780
two cases and we measure

455
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,179
the success probability

456
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,640
with disadvantage function

457
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:06,299
is giving Oracle access to an inclusion

458
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:10,140
Oracle and the Declaration mode of EK in

459
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,400
the real world

460
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,940
and it is giving Oracle access to Pi and

461
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,659
inverse function in the ideal world

462
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:21,720
Ruby and rockfox shows that the random

463
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,539
question cycle with a bit sudden Loop

464
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:30,559
functions is a PRP and foreign

465
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,860
there are various approaches for

466
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,179
designing a skill block cycle

467
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:44,460
generalized twice their structure is one

468
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,659
of the ways to construct a block cycle

469
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,900
there are various type of JFS

470
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,220
including unbalanced GMS Typhon types

471
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,400
and type 3gps

472
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,240
the probability of type 1 types and type

473
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,860
3 JFS

474
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,520
was presented by chain at home

475
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,080
to the -1 round type on GFS is a PRP

476
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,640
D plus one round type 2 JFS is a PRP and

477
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,360
the surround is on sprv

478
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,159
the plus one round type 3 GFS is a PRP

479
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,640
this construction use prfs as Primitives

480
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:35,580
artificial work Cipher generalizes a

481
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,460
block cycle to take an additional input

482
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,860
code.week

483
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,980
a TVC is a nothing from a key space

484
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,460
activity space and an Elevate space into

485
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,039
an Arabic space

486
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,159
if we pick the key and tweak

487
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:58,020
so the ekt is a permutation over n Bits

488
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,580
we will write tntvc

489
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:07,140
Port attribute tweak and N bit block TVC

490
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,460
initially tvcs has been constructed from

491
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,640
Brock Cyprus

492
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,400
the other direction to Constructor block

493
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,340
cycle from PVCs was initiated by

494
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,178
minimately

495
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,620
oh

496
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,260
instantiated

497
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,340
a faster structure with nltvc to obtain

498
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,799
to NBC

499
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,580
minimize

500
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,200
PVC based counterparts of the unbalanced

501
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,740
Jos

502
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,039
this construction uses tvcs with D minus

503
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:54,980
1 times n bit tweak and N bit block

504
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:02,120
the figure of the rights shows this dnbc

505
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,159
type and types and type 3 GFS based on

506
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,159
tvcs can naturally be defined

507
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,240
we change and with prf and x2 in PR with

508
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,980
based G of s into nltvc to construct DBC

509
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,600
based Jos

510
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,440
and the approval security of this

511
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,080
structure is open

512
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,559
our purpose of this work to summarize

513
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,600
the structure

514
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,659
and consists approval security of these

515
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:42,380
counterparts

516
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:43,799
next

517
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:47,840
I will show our contributions

518
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,539
this table shows our results in security

519
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,700
proof

520
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,440
in the table

521
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,500
here is a number of queries

522
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:04,919
we use nltvcs to obtain dnbcs

523
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,340
and I we identify the number of runs

524
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,340
needed to achieve positive and security

525
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:15,980
and BVB security with respect to n

526
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,460
PRP security and sprp security

527
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,880
separately because this construction has

528
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,220
different security characteristics

529
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,320
depending on the direction of the

530
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,000
operation

531
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,799
or TVC based type 2 and type 3 Jos we

532
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:41,299
prove sprp security

533
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:46,020
we also analyze the optimality of our

534
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,539
results with respect to the number of

535
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,320
rounds and the attack complexity

536
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,500
we do not we not set the constructions

537
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,679
we consider in this paper have iterative

538
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,400
structures

539
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,279
this table is a summary of previous

540
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,820
results

541
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,700
in the results showed by a schedule

542
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,460
is a parameter that specifies a number

543
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,799
of runs

544
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,080
that work proved strongest security

545
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,600
bonds than previous results by

546
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,520
increasing the number of rounds

547
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,460
next I will explain our security proof

548
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,700
in your security proof we use questioned

549
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,360
Edge technique

550
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,700
we write this probability for

551
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,159
interpolation probability in the real

552
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,440
world and in Ideal World

553
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:53,100
a transcript said that satisfies these

554
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,020
inequalities

555
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,919
is called an attainable transcript

556
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:01,500
in coefficient age Technique we

557
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,960
partition all the attainable transcripts

558
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,799
into good ones and bad ones

559
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:11,340
assume that they exist it shows us that

560
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,179
all good transcripts the ratio of the

561
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:18,360
interpolation probabilities is larger

562
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,260
than or equal to 1 minus Epsilon

563
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,159
then the upper bound their advantage is

564
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,140
the sum of Epsilon

565
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,960
and the probability to have both

566
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,940
transcripts in the ideal world

567
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,840
it's around

568
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,360
the probability to have both transcripts

569
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,179
depending depending on the definitions

570
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:46,700
of all goods and Bot transcripts

571
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,580
the definitions of real world Oracle R

572
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,860
is TBC based GFS

573
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,480
or the internal States in s

574
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,700
yeah the Wall Street it gets all the

575
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,240
internal States as after a makes all the

576
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,159
queries

577
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,039
for example this figure shows type on

578
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,779
GFS with these four and R is 6.

579
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:18,179
this Oracle computes the internal States

580
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:23,159
S1 and S2 with PR and P2

581
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,460
and computes the Cyber text with P3 to

582
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,940
P6

583
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,340
the definitions of the ideal World

584
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,100
Oracle I is DNB to put on the

585
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,020
computation part

586
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,860
which create a uses dummy tvcs to

587
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,799
compute dummy internal States

588
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,919
the dummy internal states have the same

589
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:49,620
probability distribution as in the real

590
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,539
world

591
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:55,080
the adversely it gets all the internal

592
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,960
States s after MX all the queries

593
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:03,659
for example this figure shows

594
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:07,440
the ideal World Oracle argue with DS4

595
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,659
and R6

596
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,360
this Oracle computes the internal States

597
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,919
S1 and S2 with PR and P2

598
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:21,500
and computes the Cyber text with pi

599
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,880
to define the set of butt transcripts we

600
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,940
consider the conditions that can only

601
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,880
hold in the ideal world

602
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,260
in the real world for tbcp

603
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,620
red x i p i

604
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,940
and y i with the input tweak and output

605
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,140
for the I Square

606
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,600
if d i x i is equal to TJ YJ

607
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,980
then we must have y i is equal to YJ

608
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,220
similarly we have TI

609
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,240
y i is equal to t j y j

610
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,039
x i is equal to x j

611
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,919
there are conditions that can only hold

612
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,659
in the ideal world

613
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,860
because we may not have

614
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,459
these equalities

615
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,679
these conditions can hold activities

616
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,399
that are not used in the ideal world

617
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,700
a transcript sitter is a bot transcript

618
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,520
it had raised one of these conditions is

619
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,120
software

620
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,020
for example in the case of the case of

621
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,980
typhoon GFS with disable and RS6

622
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,200
to end with blood collisions can occur

623
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,520
at these reduce P6 that are not used in

624
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,860
the ideal world

625
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,360
as you can see in the PE

626
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,760
the bad collisions at P3

627
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:10,039
as a collision at S2 M4 and S2

628
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,159
or the other PVCs there are two bad

629
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,700
collisions

630
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,740
with computes the probability to have

631
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,679
both transcripts in the ideal World by

632
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,779
taking summation or relevant but

633
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,700
probabilities

634
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,580
or R is 2D -2

635
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,740
we compute this upper bound

636
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:40,399
next I I will show the matching attack

637
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,659
for example

638
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,000
this figure shoes

639
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,500
in plain text attack against Taipan Jos

640
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,620
with this hole

641
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:58,019
we fix M1 M2 and M3

642
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:03,840
and red dust and block lines denotes a

643
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,019
zero difference another difference and a

644
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,559
random difference

645
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,760
we proved bus demand security with RS6

646
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,080
and BBB security with our stem with this

647
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,879
Construction

648
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,040
in the case

649
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,219
R is less than six

650
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,580
in the real world at zero difference

651
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,820
always exist in a cyphoid textbook

652
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,560
therefore this construction is this

653
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,300
distinguishable with two queries

654
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,659
implying that to D minus 2 is the

655
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,119
optimal number of runs or both Advanced

656
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,179
security

657
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,379
in the case r is rather than or equal to

658
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:55,260
6 and less than 10.

659
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,420
in the real world the Collision

660
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,240
probability at ciphertext block see

661
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,180
through interfere is about three times

662
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,160
larger than in the ideal world

663
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,619
if S4 or S5

664
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,680
was set to randomly required

665
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,540
then we have original artificial

666
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,240
therefore this construction is

667
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,820
distinguishable with 2 to the N half

668
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,280
queries

669
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,280
we pronounce that so D minus 2 is the

670
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,920
optional number of runs for BBB security

671
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,379
finally I conclude this top

672
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,720
we formalize TVC based type pump types

673
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,579
and type 3jos

674
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:48,599
and presented the approvable security

675
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:51,540
in the security proof we identify the

676
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,400
number of rounds to achieve birthday

677
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,180
Bond security and vvb security

678
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,859
we also presented a touch to show the

679
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:04,320
optimality of our results with respect

680
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,119
to the number of runs and attack

681
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,099
complexity

682
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,200
as open questions

683
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,560
we do not know if an attached piece to

684
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,980
the end complexity exists when the

685
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,680
number runs is larger than or equal to

686
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,839
that or BBB security

687
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,020
also we leave the analysis to obtain

688
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,900
stronger security bonds by increasing

689
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,740
the number of rounds

690
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:38,119
this paper focuses on in in this thing

691
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:40,260
distinguishability notion

692
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,560
in differentiability of TBC based gos is

693
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,660
open

694
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,040
here are the references

695
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,099
I'd like to close our presentation thank

696
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:55,760
you for listening

697
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,140
uh thank you for all the nice look

698
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:06,500
so we have any questions from Kobe

699
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,480
questions or comments

700
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,619
uh no questions and how about Beijing

701
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:15,180
online

702
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,440
are there any questions

703
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,900
no questions

704
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,540
okay thank you uh then I have one

705
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,079
question uh so you see that we do not

706
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,119
know if an attack with two to the power

707
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,359
and comprecially with this for bbbc2

708
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,500
construction

709
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,700
so my question is how did you find uh

710
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,800
any kind of attack or complexity 2 to

711
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,720
the power 2 N or two to the power three

712
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,320
year nothing no no no attack

713
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,400
or are there any kind of trivia

714
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,000
bound

715
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,160
Aries

716
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:02,760
today are there any kind of trivial or

717
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,680
power bound or adaptation to break the

718
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,980
vehicle Construction

719
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,380
PVP security okay so uh probably anyways

720
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,200
you didn't find any attacks to break the

721
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,439
construction

722
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,400
us

723
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,440
yes yes okay okay thank you consistency

724
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,740
so are there any additional questions or

725
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,220
comments

726
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,779
from Beijing or online

727
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,020
no

728
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,780
uh so if there is no more questions then

729
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,020
I'd like to thank uh the speakers of

730
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,420
this session and just because of this

731
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,220
conference all the speakers of this

732
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,299
conference I think thank you
