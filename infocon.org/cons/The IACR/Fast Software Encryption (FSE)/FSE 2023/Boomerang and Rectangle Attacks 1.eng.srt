1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,179
rectangle attacks

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:03,720
um

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,299
in this session we have two talks

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,900
the first talk is a new Properties or

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,559
double boomerang inactivity table

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,400
the authors are changing

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,240
situation dampage label the speaker is

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,240
welcome

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,279
hello everyone my name is I come from

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,520
Institute of information engineering

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,579
I appreciate this opportunity to make

12
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,320
the presentation

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,439
[Music]

14
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,640
there are five parts in my presentation

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,899
the first one is the preliminary

16
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,739
it is known that Boomerang attack is one

17
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,719
variant of differentials and

18
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,659
differential attacks and the aim of it

19
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,600
is to construct a long differential by

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,939
using two short ones with high

21
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,299
probability and there is assumption that

22
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,840
the two trails are independent

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,000
then researchers focus on the dependency

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,060
between the differentials the sandwich

25
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,600
attack was proposed some which attacker

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,479
divided the suffering to three parts e0

27
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,080
em and E1 sandwich attack has all the

28
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,720
dependency in the middle part em

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,720
now let's review some definitions used

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
in Boomer attack

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,220
dtgs usually used in differential

32
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,680
attacks

33
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,860
dttr1 F2 means the number of the pairs

34
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,159
satisfying the conditions that the input

35
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
difference is Alpha one before the Xbox

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,520
and the output difference is after 2

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,420
after the Xbox

38
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:09,959
PCT is the Boomer connectivity table and

39
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,099
the BCT up one beta2 is the number of

40
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,620
the cortex satisfying the conditions

41
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,440
that the input difference in the

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,319
occupies is after one before the Xbox

43
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,220
and the output difference is beta 2 in

44
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,819
the lower path after the Xbox

45
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,980
compared with VCT the ubct as one

46
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,260
condition in the Upper price

47
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,280
everyone Alpha 2 Beta 2 satisfying and

48
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,300
three conditions

49
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:54,060
similarly lpct the lower pctm it is the

50
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,800
number of the quotas satisfying three

51
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,500
conditions that there is one condition

52
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,099
in a lower path

53
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,519
EBC ta is the extended BCT it is the

54
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,099
number of the quarters satisfying the

55
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,099
four conditions

56
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:18,080
so are they suitable set for one Xbox

57
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,360
informal attack in the yam there are

58
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,140
always some rounds so how about two

59
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,560
continuous Xbox or three or two

60
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,860
continuous Xbox systems

61
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,560
first we give the definition about the

62
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,519
double Boomer connectivity table so look

63
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,540
at the figure F R1 and Alpha 2 are the

64
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,420
differences in the Upper price for the

65
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,659
second for the first Xbox and the beta2

66
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,140
and the bit 3 are the differences for

67
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,120
the second Xbox in the lower path a dpct

68
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,260
F1 beta 3 is equal to the sum of the

69
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,980
lower dbct other one of two beta 2 and

70
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,459
beta 3 where the lower ddct is equal to

71
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,700
the upct times the UB City for the first

72
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,880
Xbox and the times the LBC for the

73
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,478
second Xbox

74
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,919
from some DB City we find that

75
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:30,360
for all Xboxes non-zero dpct occurs

76
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,000
mainly when Alpha 2 is equal to beta2

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,320
that is in the DBC tier there are mainly

78
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,300
Lander switch and Xbox switch

79
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,180
especially for some Xbox

80
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,880
there are only land switch and Xbox

81
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,540
switch

82
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:59,400
that is for all F1 and B3 DB this

83
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,639
equation is true and from the equation

84
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,240
we can obtain a relationship between DBC

85
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,139
and DDT and it also reduce the time

86
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,479
complexity for DB City from for definite

87
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,240
Dimensions to three dimensions

88
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,620
such as the Xbox of

89
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,979
present AIR block mips and a twin or

90
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:29,759
this Xbox are hard and for others such

91
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,380
as craft skinny project camera they are

92
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,100
General Xbox

93
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,080
some extensions of the property

94
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,320
the first one is the further for a hard

95
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,979
Xbox not only the dbct but also tdct uh

96
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:01,500
the equation is always true so for tpctm

97
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,340
there is always a relationship between

98
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,039
the tbcd and the DDT

99
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,300
the second one is we catch some property

100
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,720
about the block surface with complex

101
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,820
linear layer such as ES

102
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,000
table shows the number of actions for

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,819
each for each value for the DBC T

104
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,660
actually use the AES and the basic DBC

105
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,660
team for the yes

106
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,880
from the table we can find that the

107
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,740
basic deficit here the XBox server is is

108
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:47,039
hard without zero values and DBC here IG

109
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,539
with the complex linear most values are

110
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:57,318
zero this point observes our attentions

111
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,720
now let's see some application of the

112
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,280
new property

113
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,039
the first one the through the same

114
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,080
Boomerang distinguisher with a different

115
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,680
text box how DBC uniformity and the hard

116
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,720
Xbox matter we take the seven round

117
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,680
distinguisher of craft as an example

118
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,599
this table shows the property of the

119
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,220
distinguisher with the different text

120
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,319
boxes

121
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,440
from the table we can find that craft

122
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,039
and the present share the same DDT and

123
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,759
the BCT but the present has a better

124
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,900
vbct than craft and the Xbox of presence

125
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,139
is hard the result is that the presence

126
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,460
has a lower probability than crafted

127
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,259
camera has a better visit here than

128
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,419
present but present with a smaller PPC

129
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,000
here and

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,720
the Xbox of Commerce General the result

131
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,000
is that the presence has a lower

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,099
probability

133
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:12,240
these three Xboxes share the same DDT

134
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,860
BCT and the DBC team and all of the all

135
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,419
of them are hard so the result is that

136
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:25,818
they have almost the same probability

137
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:30,360
I'm the smallest obesity and the

138
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,059
smallest dbcg and both the Xbox of them

139
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,919
are hardened

140
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,159
uh the reality that they have the lowest

141
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,559
probability

142
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,440
from these observations we found that

143
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,380
apart from the uniformity of ECT and the

144
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,220
DDT the uniformity of DB cities is a new

145
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,800
major Criterion to evaluate the

146
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,880
performance of Xbox

147
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,260
and the second application that for the

148
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,300
AES the DB city was complex linearly has

149
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,540
too many zero values

150
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,839
inspired by this way we compute some

151
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,720
distinguishers

152
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,360
with about the block servers based on

153
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,279
AES such as three as under directors

154
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,980
yeah

155
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,040
we found that three distinguishers of

156
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,480
them

157
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,779
have zero probability

158
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,439
so

159
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,839
that is for a hard as box with a complex

160
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:50,300
linear layer should be treated carefully

161
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,440
the

162
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,380
um I'll give the a map module to search

163
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,220
for the boom range with the Clusters

164
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,620
cluster probability briefly

165
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,980
in the previous works there are always

166
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,080
two steps to search for the boomerang

167
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,200
distinguisher step one is to search for

168
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,500
good transcripted booming characteristic

169
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,040
with the least active expenses and step

170
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,019
two is to search for the best

171
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,180
institutions

172
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,720
in our work way

173
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,180
give a formula for the probability of

174
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,519
clusters firstly and then give and a new

175
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,459
map model to search for good clusters

176
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,239
directly

177
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,680
in e0

178
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,519
or in E1 we use the numbers of cells

179
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,240
which needs to be Zero from uniformity

180
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,620
to describe the probability

181
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,240
cm to describe the probability where cm

182
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,240
is the sum of the number of seals which

183
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,180
needs to be Zero from uniformity the U

184
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,980
the number of

185
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,420
uddt2 and lddt2 the number of mpct and

186
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,880
the number of visit here

187
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,620
for example use our formula we can give

188
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,459
the conditions for the 13 Rounds the

189
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,018
distinguisher of craft

190
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,820
indicate that the conditions are closely

191
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,360
related to the actual probability

192
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,760
then

193
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,040
for the MLP model we give some rules

194
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,440
about the attribute attribute

195
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,959
propagations

196
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:52,019
through these operations such as suffice

197
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,560
the actual operation and the rule of

198
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,060
modding of a modding modeling of the

199
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,240
table and the modeling of the upper and

200
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,160
the lower boundary

201
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,220
the objective function is to minimize

202
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,540
the number of conditions

203
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:18,180
and using and we use the new Pro new MLP

204
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,600
model with

205
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,200
two

206
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,079
Neo Boomerang distinguishers of The

207
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,300
Craft with a higher probability than

208
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,599
before

209
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,899
uh now this is the conclusion

210
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,720
um as far as the way and give some

211
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,560
properties of dbct such as the lender

212
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,440
switch and Xbox switch happen in most

213
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,360
cases for all Xboxes and uh first

214
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,959
um had Xbox only the lender switch and

215
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,920
the Xbox switch are possible

216
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,920
that these properties has that the dbct

217
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,160
is important to evaluate the performance

218
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,480
of Xbox and hard as the box with a

219
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,240
complex linear layer should be treated

220
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,040
carefully

221
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,459
the second way

222
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:20,279
give give an image model

223
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:25,019
to search for the Clusters at first we

224
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,200
give a formula for the properties for

225
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,820
for the probability of clusters and then

226
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,279
we give the model with the cluster

227
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,820
probability

228
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,980
thank you for your attention

229
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,839
that's all

230
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,440
thanks

231
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,599
any questions

232
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,180
I have a question

233
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,279
a

234
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,680
on Pittston

235
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,000
on page 10.

236
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,220
I wonder if it's possible that uh

237
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,899
Alpha 2 on the left

238
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:23,639
can be different from the other two

239
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,600
other

240
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,920
writer

241
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,380
there's either either the middle part of

242
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,740
the picture

243
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,420
and at the same time the

244
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,399
better to

245
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,199
can be different from the Earth to

246
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,000
the beta 2 in front can be different

247
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,019
from the better to

248
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,440
impact yeah yeah but there is the

249
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,660
assumption that the two

250
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,620
uh the opposite sides are equal

251
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,100
to can

252
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,320
they are not

253
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,279
uh it actually uh better to and and

254
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,639
better too

255
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,440
yeah yeah

256
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,220
uh

257
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,380
is not equal to bet3pm

258
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,040
but in our work we have the assumption

259
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,000
that the two sides are equal

260
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,420
okay okay

261
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,260
thank you

262
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,680
thanks

263
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,839
on page 26 uh

264
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,800
um three years and the Deoxys are OAS

265
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,300
like suffers so I would like to know

266
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,279
um besides as long suffers that's

267
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:26,579
incompatibility exist in other servers

268
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:31,260
uh yes it is possible

269
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,459
for these Xboxes with the

270
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:37,800
property the

271
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:44,279
it is maybe for others block servers

272
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,540
okay thank you

273
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,759
hi

274
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:56,279
thank you for your presentation I was

275
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,920
wondering did you try to use the milk on

276
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,660
skinny

277
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,720
that seem a similar MLP model

278
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,459
and skinny

279
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,900
ah

280
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,660
I'm sorry button

281
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,699
did you try to use the milp on skinny oh

282
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,839
yeah yeah I I have a tried to

283
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,640
application apply the model to skinny

284
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,160
but the results in that way it didn't

285
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
have the

286
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,940
more

287
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,580
more lower probability

288
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:38,340
so we we didn't show this result

289
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,820
okay thank you and on craft more than 10

290
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,320
rounds

291
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,840
did you find any distinguisher or was it

292
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,699
the same done in the literature

293
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,140
wow

294
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,299
did you apply it and craft more than 10

295
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,360
rounds because I you have yeah yeah we

296
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,139
have a

297
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:10,440
uh yeah uh we have tried to uh try to

298
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,000
applying the model to the distinguisher

299
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,660
more than 10 rounds but it's also we get

300
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,080
we didn't look at the good results

301
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,820
yeah thank you very much

302
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,840
thank you

303
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,240
oh hello

304
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,240
in my understanding that the safety has

305
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,660
a strong connection with a linear layer

306
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,860
in Cipher and the biased suitable

307
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,140
situation I think is the if if the

308
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,260
linear layer is a binary Matrix but for

309
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,059
the bitwise commutation and and even the

310
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:55,340
mdis Matrix

311
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,919
I want to know that what's the advantage

312
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,900
of the DB City over the BCT UBC LP

313
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,460
safety framework thank you

314
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:20,299
uh firstly for the Xbox tpct is

315
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:24,840
is equal to upct times lbct and there

316
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,960
are four Diamond Dimensions but uh

317
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:37,320
there is a but we can use DDT to compute

318
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,419
dbct with only three dimensions so the

319
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,059
first it can reduce the time complexity

320
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,059
and

321
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:50,780
for General Xbox system

322
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,740
the the

323
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,700
equation is always true so

324
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,000
enter

325
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,179
in DBC TN

326
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:05,880
the lower DB City occurs mainly when

327
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,740
Alpha 2 is equal to beta2 so we can use

328
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:16,280
we can also use DDT to replace BBC TN

329
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,020
with some

330
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,080
um

331
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,280
if in uh

332
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,299
in many distinguishers the computers

333
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:34,080
very complexities so

334
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,860
sometimes it may

335
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:42,000
we sometimes it is true it is too huge

336
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,059
to compute the uh the probabilities so

337
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:52,799
maybe use the DDT to replace DB City now

338
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,679
we can get the probability

339
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,240
um

340
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,500
in a short term

341
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:11,000
under the the hard Xbox assumption

342
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,660
yeah

343
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,419
okay and the next question is

344
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,760
I will try to consider the

345
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,760
DB City while the entry value in the MLP

346
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,760
model or even the

347
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,120
a specific value of the deposition

348
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,299
and because I noticed that the MLP model

349
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,720
you present that only focus on the

350
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,900
Obesity obesity and our utdt yeah

351
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,520
uh

352
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,100
[Music]

353
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,659
the MB City include includes the DBC TM

354
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,820
and

355
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,820
um

356
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,760
in our

357
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,840
in our MRP model

358
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,520
okay and the last question is

359
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,860
is there any connection between the

360
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,919
boundary of AI and the

361
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,760
DB City and on the maximum maximum

362
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,260
number of T in the PCP

363
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,500
sorry

364
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,120
I want to know it's there and a

365
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,039
connection between the

366
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,960
boundary of aim and the maximum number

367
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,799
of the typicity of uh

368
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,520
specifics

369
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,780
staffer

370
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,820
uh

371
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,799
yeah

372
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,900
for the

373
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,320
for our hardest box the TBC team this

374
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,140
formula is always true we can use we can

375
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,980
also use DDT to replace the TBC TBC TN

376
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,020
okay thank you

377
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,539
okay

378
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:23,460
I think we don't care attempt for for

379
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,860
other questions uh thanks attention for

380
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,980
the talk uh let's have the next talk

381
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,900
thank you

382
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,900
um

383
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,960
uh the next talk is that 80 automatic

384
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,080
search of Pokemon distinguishers for ARX

385
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,799
servers the author said that whole one

386
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,740
uh one situation although the speaker is

387
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,400
welcome yes

388
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,810
feature

389
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,020
[Music]

390
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,580
record

391
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,419
um anyways

392
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,940
hi everyone my name is my report is

393
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,100
about saturated automatic search of

394
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,559
Boomerang distinguishers for AI ciphers

395
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,020
this is a joint work with one about time

396
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,740
and since the way

397
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,840
uh Boomerang Crypt analysis is a

398
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,159
technique to connect to a short

399
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,980
differential characteristics to form a

400
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,320
new distinguisher covering more rounds

401
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,080
the whole cycle is separated into two

402
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,840
parts for each part a differential

403
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,020
characteristic is applied then under an

404
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,620
independence assumption these two

405
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,760
characteristics can be connected like

406
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,159
this figure

407
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,100
then however previous work found that

408
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,279
this assumption may not always fold and

409
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,679
several techniques were proposed to fix

410
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,820
this problem

411
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,580
one of them is the sandwich framework

412
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,940
like this figure in the middle a new

413
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,539
part is separated out for the switch and

414
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:04,020
denoted by em uh special cryptanalysis

415
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,779
is put on this part to analyze the

416
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,740
connectivity of the characteristics

417
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,380
typically the crypto analysis on em is

418
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,900
reduced to that on the nonlinear

419
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,340
operations

420
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,940
for SPN ciphers it is reduced to the

421
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,760
crypto analysis on the Xbox

422
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,740
as this as this scenario

423
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,260
since the Xbox

424
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,600
is typically small we can enumerate all

425
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,159
of its inputs and the result is a new

426
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,960
table called Boomerang connectivity

427
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,940
table

428
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,360
in 2020 researchers found that we still

429
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,659
need more variants of the BCT which are

430
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:54,000
the ubct lbct and the ebct

431
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,520
I'm until now the crypto analysis on

432
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,860
Xbox's coverage but what about the

433
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,600
what about the boomerang activity table

434
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,799
on the other nonlinear operations in

435
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,200
particular we are talking we are

436
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,100
thinking about the BCT on the modular

437
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,059
Edition

438
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,400
to the best of our knowledge there is

439
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,880
only one previous result

440
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,400
but the definition of these VCT is given

441
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,880
without many details and it it is also

442
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,720
claimed that the difference number uh it

443
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,200
is the one below the figure it is

444
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,880
claimed that this difference must be

445
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,500
zero but however in our work we found we

446
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,480
noticed that if we view the modular

447
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,320
addition as a special Xbox like this red

448
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,600
equation

449
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,659
uh all the previous techniques on Xboxes

450
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,900
can be applied here and the formula is

451
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,679
as below

452
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,640
uh you may see that this formula depicts

453
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,840
a very large BCT it has four dimensions

454
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,200
with each Dimension has size

455
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,940
um maybe 16 bits 24 bits or 32 bits

456
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,460
so to compute Computing the whole BCT

457
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,980
it would be impractical and sometimes

458
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,240
infeasible

459
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,900
so we are thinking about is there a fast

460
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,140
method to compute one arbitrary entry in

461
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,840
this BCT if so can we construct same

462
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,020
models for it and furthermore are there

463
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,020
any new results on the AI ciphers

464
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,480
based on this motivation our

465
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,020
contribution separated into three parts

466
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,080
first we design dynamic programming

467
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,960
algorithm to compute to efficiently

468
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,760
compute the tables

469
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,640
second we constructed models for these

470
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,000
tables and finally we tag specially as

471
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,279
examples and improve the previous

472
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,260
results

473
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,480
okay let me introduce the computation of

474
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,140
the BCT during the computation there are

475
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,919
two important equations here

476
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,140
they are they depicts the relation

477
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,200
between the modular addition and the xoi

478
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,520
operation

479
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,399
here I want you to focus on the

480
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,260
recursive definition of the carry

481
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,100
function

482
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,059
for example the C the carry 0 the ice

483
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,299
speed of C only depends on the previous

484
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:38,940
speeds on X Y and C so does B this is it

485
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,020
is is an important property for our

486
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,399
algorithm

487
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,120
with these two equations we can

488
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,279
we can rewrite the definition of the

489
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,320
Obesity into a

490
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,240
a much simpler form

491
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,179
with this new definition we have two

492
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:06,120
observations the first observation is

493
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,539
that every every this equation is a

494
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,899
restriction on the I minus one state of

495
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:16,799
L and R but what about the M minus one

496
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,340
speed of ion r the answer is they can

497
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,700
take arbitrary values because this is

498
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,279
the only restriction derived from the

499
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,840
definition

500
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,960
the second observation is that the four

501
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,880
bit string can only take a possible

502
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,740
values here I concatenate for

503
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,419
carry bits into a for hobby string

504
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:45,240
based on these observations we can

505
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,659
partition the BC the definition of the

506
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,559
BCT into several subsets uh by the

507
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,340
values of the bits of lnr and these four

508
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,000
B strings since every values of the bits

509
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,740
of the LR is are valid so we can sum up

510
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,059
all of the cases into a new form

511
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,940
here we did not here we Define the new

512
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,399
function f to represent the rightmost

513
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:15,480
part

514
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,720
because the original part is too

515
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,640
complicated

516
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,399
okay now our goal turns into how to

517
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:26,360
compute the function f

518
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,399
a trivial idea is to partition the

519
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,580
function f Again

520
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:36,960
by these variables but these times we we

521
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,980
notice that some of the values of uh the

522
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,240
M minus two feet of L and R uh could be

523
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,500
invalid so we Define the new function G

524
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,440
to denote whether the chosen value of

525
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,320
these two bits are valid or not with the

526
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,380
function G we can continue to sum up all

527
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,779
of the cases

528
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:04,380
and now the computation becomes this uh

529
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,539
again we Define a new function T to

530
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:08,340
represent the summation of the function

531
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,419
G

532
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:12,059
here I want to know that the function

533
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:15,179
function P can be pre-computed because

534
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,419
its input is only two four bit string

535
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,340
and another for big values

536
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,940
and you can see again we have a

537
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,320
recursive definition of the function f

538
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,240
and this is very perfect for a dynamic

539
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,580
programming algorithm if you are not

540
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,520
familiar with this kind of pro this kind

541
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,860
of algorithm you may think about the

542
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,700
computation of the Fibonacci theories

543
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,919
the computation of the same

544
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,580
before showing the our algorithm I want

545
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,200
to know another

546
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,120
important property we found

547
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,539
it is a symmetry in the computation

548
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:04,860
this symmetry helps to reduce the time

549
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,760
complexity of our algorithm

550
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,539
okay here comes our algorithm line a is

551
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:16,919
conforms to the summation in our formula

552
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,380
and then we found a way to booleanize

553
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,179
this algorithm by uh if if the value of

554
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:26,760
T is non-zero then we Define a new

555
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,960
variable TB to be in one if the value of

556
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,940
T is zero then we set a zero value TB

557
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,960
with this modification we we obtained a

558
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,860
new computation of f as the below one

559
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,100
uh this equation contains only Boolean

560
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,340
operations and this equation can check

561
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,980
whether F whether the function f is

562
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,960
non-zero or not

563
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,080
based on this new computation we

564
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,720
multiplied our algorithm you can see the

565
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,100
line eight light also conforms to

566
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,740
to the max operation in this formula

567
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,440
this algorithm is able to check whether

568
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,619
the BCT entry is non-zero or not this is

569
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:16,320
our first step into booleanize the

570
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,040
computation and Boolean booleanization

571
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,119
is important for set models

572
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,460
furthermore we want to control the

573
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,679
computation folder we found another

574
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,839
important observation

575
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:34,379
for all you in this set if the value of

576
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:38,040
T is not uh or non-zero then we have

577
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,379
another recursive definition of the

578
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,659
summation or function f

579
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,179
please remember that the computational

580
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:48,719
BCT is also the summation of function f

581
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,719
So based on this observation we derive a

582
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,619
heuristic check

583
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:59,700
I call it partial obesity if k out of n

584
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,460
minus 1 these equations are required to

585
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,160
be satisfied the resulting BCT entry

586
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,060
would be 4 to the power of K plus 1

587
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,280
times a number q that is we just Express

588
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,859
uh this red sentence as Boolean

589
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:18,480
expressions

590
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,099
a k of term

591
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:25,320
this idea comes from the partial DDT by

592
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,500
the previous work

593
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,320
with uh the this partial BCP we are

594
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,940
expecting uh cancel out the small values

595
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:41,480
in the BCT and obtain a size reduce BCT

596
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,420
However the fact is that currently we

597
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,339
lack enough knowledge about the number

598
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:50,940
two second the resulting partial obesity

599
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,240
still contains still contains small

600
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,500
entries

601
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,619
but luckily our experiments show that

602
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:01,079
the model always returns BCT entries

603
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,380
with value around 4 to the power of K

604
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,920
plus one this is enough for us to

605
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,400
construct the assets models

606
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,820
Here Comes our complete model uh based

607
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,859
on this based on the previous algorithm

608
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:20,880
we model line 8 as the first of first

609
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,460
Boolean expression

610
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,400
for line 10 to 13 we create another

611
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,420
Boolean operation or Boolean expression

612
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,220
and heuristic trick is applied to the

613
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:40,399
first Boolean Boolean expression

614
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,180
uh I want to know that our model cannot

615
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:49,200
return the the exact value of this entry

616
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,220
it can only select arbitrary entry in

617
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,020
the BCT so previous the previous

618
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,900
searching model cannot apply it here so

619
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,099
we have to come up with another

620
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:07,560
new Frameworks searching framework

621
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,380
our first framework is

622
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,740
um our first frame will aims to file

623
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,560
aims to find Boomerang characteristics

624
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,540
with high probability

625
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,079
we treat we just tweaked the thresholds

626
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,660
in switch in the switch that is the size

627
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,740
of the partial obesity and then search

628
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,500
the characteristic until we found the

629
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,040
desired characteristic this framework is

630
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,380
passed but maybe some better

631
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,280
characteristics

632
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,140
our second framework is quite

633
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,520
complicated we first set a threshold to

634
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,220
zero that is we consider the whole

635
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,480
obesity

636
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,599
and then we found the upper bound of the

637
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,520
probability of the boomerang

638
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,640
characteristics then we treat the

639
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,099
threshold again and this time we also

640
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,660
treat the upper bound of the probability

641
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,060
then we enumerate all the

642
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,119
characteristics and how the number of

643
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,940
the characteristics then we return the

644
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:15,420
largest cluster as the result

645
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,200
due to the enumeration this framework is

646
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,079
this framework is slow but can take the

647
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,500
advantages of the clustering effects

648
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,640
this is our results

649
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,099
we found

650
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:35,579
current best boomerang distinguisher on

651
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:39,780
spec 32 and spec 48 we also fixed the

652
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,720
previous probability estimate estimation

653
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,640
of Lee

654
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,980
uh you can see in this table five uh ax

655
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,400
Tools return the precise result in a

656
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,300
very short time much faster 10 hours

657
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,300
so we do a comparison

658
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,720
uh the first result is that you may

659
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,000
think that our algorithm is very similar

660
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,720
to the AIX tools but they are in fact

661
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,220
constructed from two different

662
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,640
perspectives our perspective reviews

663
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,579
more mathematical properties behind the

664
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:20,760
modular Edition which are not published

665
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,000
before

666
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,680
as

667
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,380
you have already seen AI tools is faster

668
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,119
and more precise

669
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,180
and finally also the most important

670
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,339
thing is that our technique is capable

671
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,880
of searching characteristics while ai's

672
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,520
tools cannot

673
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,839
okay let me do a conclusion uh our in

674
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,599
this work we accomplish three results

675
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,520
the

676
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,280
um efficient algorithm the set models

677
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,339
for this table and new results on these

678
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:59,099
two ciphers but there are also some

679
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,500
limitations on our technique

680
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,660
the first one is the the current

681
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,660
computation of the tables are not quite

682
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,540
convenient and not very convenient to be

683
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,800
modeled

684
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,980
if you look into my code you will find

685
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,680
that our you can find our model is quite

686
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,880
large

687
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,000
so uh the current models for the switch

688
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,680
are too large if we want to search uh

689
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,359
the some some complicated Cipher the

690
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:34,020
model May would be invisible and third

691
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,839
the optimal distinguisher are still

692
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,420
unknown because our technique is a

693
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,400
heuristic technique

694
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,460
and finally comparing with ai's tools

695
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,000
our computation of the probabilities are

696
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,560
slow

697
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,320
all the codes are publicly available at

698
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,720
my GitHub repository you can download

699
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,359
the code here

700
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,980
thank you very much for your attention

701
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,119
I think we didn't have them for further

702
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:09,359
questions thanks dash one for the nest

703
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,920
talk

704
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,300
the standard sessions

705
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,940
foreign
