00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,920
okay so um welcome everyone so this is

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,599
the program chair report

61
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,640
um

62
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,879
[Music]

63
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,620
we must honestly confess we kind of

64
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,940
copied it from previous year but we

65
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,319
updated the numbers

66
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,099
um

67
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,200
but that was a bit a bit easier and so

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,879
first of all I really appreciate that we

69
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,680
that there were so many people so more

70
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,620
than uh 100 people in in Beijing and

71
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,540
also a lot of people here so there's a

72
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,340
huge people a huge amount of people that

73
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,419
came here

74
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,460
I came to FSC this year so that's really

75
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,139
nice

76
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:28,740
um

77
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,960
so yeah this is the the the

78
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,000
um the typical site you've seen for

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,600
Tosca I mean since 2016 we had up to

80
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,900
2015 2016 actually we had the FSC and

81
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,540
then we changed to the uh the journal

82
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,820
style the set transactions of symmetric

83
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,160
crypto and it's published by the Hulu

84
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,900
University

85
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,419
um it's indexed and selected for

86
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,220
inclusion by the web in the web of

87
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,600
science

88
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,080
um we've had four we typically have like

89
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,900
four issues per year on a regular

90
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,419
schedule so always like the first of the

91
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,880
month except for November but typically

92
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,680
we have a deadline around every three

93
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,020
months and two months after that you get

94
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,120
the notification

95
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,460
um for regular papers for long papers

96
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,800
this could be extended and this actually

97
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,220
has happened last round

98
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,160
um we have a journal style decisions so

99
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,139
we had accepted papers minor revisions

100
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,539
major revisions reject and resubmit

101
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,759
which is basically rejection but we

102
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,340
encourage to resubmit at some point and

103
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,820
rejections and we welcome regular

104
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,740
submissions systemization of knowledge

105
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,259
at pandems and college and coriander

106
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,060
papers

107
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,180
um

108
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,979
so this is the typical schedule

109
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,060
So currently we um are at FSE

110
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,680
um y plus one it doesn't matter that

111
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,240
much this is a general schedule so let

112
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,860
me just go to the

113
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,900
um the normal schedule right now so

114
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,280
we're at FSC 2023 of March 2023 and we

115
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,120
have papers from the task issue 2022 in

116
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,139
issue two three four and 2023 issue one

117
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,660
and this is like that has been going on

118
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,479
for years and it will go on for years

119
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,880
and except for last year there was the

120
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,460
exception that for FZ 2022 we had six

121
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,280
issues and but now we're kind of going

122
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,020
back to normal not entirely

123
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,520
unfortunately but we're kind of going

124
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,080
back to normal we have four issues here

125
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,259
and this is where we are right now

126
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,000
um a bit of Statistics so in total we

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,460
accepted 48 papers out of these four

128
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,100
issues so that's on average 12 papers

129
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,100
per issue and yeah we had two invited

130
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,319
talks so Cy soon already gave the talk

131
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,680
yesterday tomorrow to be your sokoturo

132
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,360
um yeah and we have the the ROM session

133
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,800
which is happening right now so um

134
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,680
so thanks for uh sharing the ROM session

135
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,100
um so some Statistics over the year

136
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,600
um

137
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,580
yeah I mean it doesn't say much but it's

138
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,280
a nice uh graph right so

139
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,139
I mean it doesn't say much because also

140
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,819
the number of submissions kind of gross

141
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,160
you see a bit more submissions these

142
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,660
four issues so the last four issues are

143
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,060
the ones who are seeing this conference

144
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,060
the ones within uh with the star so you

145
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,880
see the total of no total total number

146
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,580
of submissions is has increased a bit

147
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,819
compared to last four issues the number

148
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,880
of accepted papers also has increased a

149
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,560
bit

150
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,479
um yeah what else can we see here not

151
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,240
that much right no this is yeah I mean

152
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,699
we kind of see there were quite a lot of

153
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,300
submissions

154
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,280
um a bit more statistic so we had 184

155
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,740
regular submissions

156
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,039
and well we accepted 48 48 so that's

157
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,139
around

158
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:56,280
26 percent

159
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,000
and those were accepted

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,440
um

161
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,240
one thing that's interesting and it was

162
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,740
also last year the case like major

163
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,020
revisions actually often returned to

164
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,139
tusk so for the last four issues there

165
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,000
were 21

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
um major revisions resubmitted and we

167
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,340
gave 19 major revision decisions

168
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,960
so that's almost the same but that's

169
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,199
also because we have the cutoff at 2023

170
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,860
one and now 2023 2 is happening but

171
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,599
that's for the next year so there is

172
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,599
this this shift of one issue

173
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:31,379
um

174
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,120
maybe I shouldn't I shouldn't call it

175
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,799
resubmitted because if a paper is a

176
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,958
major major revision then it's still

177
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,659
kept in submission officially and for

178
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,399
reject and resubmit the number is quite

179
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,700
low compared to uh major revision so

180
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,220
around 50 of the reject and resubmits

181
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,779
return

182
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,480
so this is also statistics so we had 13

183
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,580
rechecks that reject and resubmits

184
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,500
resubmitted

185
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,700
okay and uh 27 decisions so again there

186
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,380
is also still the shift between previous

187
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,920
and next round but you kind of see this

188
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,019
pattern also last year we had a pattern

189
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,920
of around 50 resubmitted

190
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,560
um so socks we accept systemizations of

191
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,240
knowledge but there were not many stock

192
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,480
submissions uh this year too actually

193
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,220
and one of them got accepted

194
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,320
we also accept addendums and

195
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,420
corresandams but none of them got

196
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,800
submitted

197
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,140
and also none of them got

198
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,720
accepted

199
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,040
um

200
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,140
so yeah we had a quite big program

201
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,720
company 43 people so some of them are

202
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,700
here some of them are in Beijing so um

203
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,880
maybe we should have take a moment to

204
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,980
thank all of them

205
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,540
um

206
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,120
and um yeah some of them are still in

207
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,339
the new one so we typically try to vary

208
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,800
the committee quite a bit but there it's

209
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
not always possible to have a new

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,880
committee every year of course

211
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,720
um

212
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,940
so another another group of people who

213
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,740
we need to thank is of course Gregor the

214

um well you already saw the best paper

241
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,320

242
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,760
it will be

243
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,200

250
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,339

263
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:45,199
the ROM session and the conference

264
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,380
thank you very much

265
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,279
so the next talk is about news from the

266
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,700
fac steering committee and the talk will

267
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,019
be given by ankanto

268
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,980
thank you tetsu

269
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,240
so uh I serve as a chair of this FSC

270
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,079
steering committee

271
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,600
doesn't work

272
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,139
okay

273
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,700
so uh as you might know uh the FSC

274
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,639
steering committee has set up uh this

275
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,920
year a test of time award for FSC

276
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,540
and so

277
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,639
um the idea is that this test of time

278
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,459
award is given every year to a paper

279
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,420
which has been presented at FSC 15 years

280
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,360
before and so so the principle is that

281
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,540
we would like to honor a paper which had

282
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,459
a lasting impact on our field and so

283
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,139
this year is the first year for this

284
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,540
test of time award and we decided to

285
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,120
have not only one Awards but three

286
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,360
different Awards one award for this year

287
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,620
so for FSE 2023 but also one for FSU

288
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,760
2022 and one for FSU 2021

289
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,579
so this means that's the eligible papers

290
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:22,100
where all papers presented at FSC

291
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,779
2006

292
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,540
2007 and 2008.

293
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,720
and uh so all these papers were elitable

294
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,779
but also we invite everyone from the

295
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,720
vfse community to nominate papers and so

296
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
we received 12 nominations for these

297
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,459
Awards and I would like to thanks all

298
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,699
those sending some nominations

299
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:47,160
and so

300
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,220
let us start with uh the awards for FSE

301
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,380
2021 so it's for papers presented at FSE

302
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,060
2006 so the committee was chaired by

303
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,120
ordunkerman but or could not make it and

304
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,940
so Guyton will

305
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,079
announce the winner

306
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:14,120
thank you so this is the award from FSC

307
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,839
2006. it's given to a paper by titsuweta

308
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,880
new block Cipher modes of operation with

309
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,300
beyond the birthday bound security and

310
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,040
so it was a difficult Choice there were

311
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,160
many good papers at FSC 2006 but we

312
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,260
chose this one because we thought it's a

313
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,240
really nice and elegant result about

314
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,300
Beyond birthday bound mode but

315
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,660
unfortunately is not really used but it

316
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,339
would really be better to use it because

317
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,740
it's also a lot of problem that that we

318
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,060
have now so congratulations

319
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,600
thank you very much for the hours I

320
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,760
would like to thank all the people who

321
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,639
supported me and the committee members

322
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,120
this paper was published

323
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,459
17 years ago and uh since then I have

324
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,220
learned a lot from this community

325
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,120
and I I hope that I can continue

326
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,680
contributing to this community

327
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,420

uh this I'm here but I'm just one of the

357
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,700
members of the design team and this is a

358
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,299
result of the teamwork and I'm really

359
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,960
happy to see that this Cipher remains

360
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,500
a target for pept analysis

361
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,900
even

362
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,220
today

363
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,919

okay

373
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:00,539
so uh the FSC a 28 tests time of the our

374
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,260
route goes to uh the paper by

375
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,740
saying demon C and Ali I didn't the

376
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,440
title is meet in the middle attack on

377
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,380
eight rounds hey yes

378
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,400
and the paper proposes uh ground

379
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,660
breaking powerful attack on the most

380
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,760
important Cipher and the technique has

381
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,700
wide applications and we even see its

382
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,919
applications

383
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,400
in the quantum setting recently so uh

384
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,580
the paper has had a lasting impact to

385
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,500
the fields and we would like to

386
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,360
congratulate congratulations

387
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,539
so now it's time to thanks our general

388
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:55,140
chairs for this event and uh of course I

389
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,580
would like to

390
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,220
start uh with words and altars in

391
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,679
Beijing being sang and making Wong

392
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,400
because they had really a huge and very

393
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,640
complicated job maybe some of you do not

394
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,299
know or do not remember but FSC was

395
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,980
originally supposed to be held in

396
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,059
Beijing in 2021 and so we had to

397
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,980
postpone the conference several time

398
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,520
because of covet and then also been and

399
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,799
making their heads to deal with travel

400
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,860
restrictions we have health restrictions

401
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,820
and so on so and I know that really

402
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,760
taking care of the organization of FSC

403
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,340
has been a lot of work especially for

404
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,940
being in the last few weeks so really uh

405
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,640
I would like on behalf of the Ontario

406
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,280
committee I would like to to thank them

407
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,740
for making this FSU agreed success

408
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,919
thanks a lot been in making

409
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,760
10.

410
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,260
I I'm sorry unfortunately I cannot give

411
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,419
you the plaque in person but for sure I

412
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,539
will send it to you by post

413
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:13,919
and uh as you know also because uh we

414
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,460
had many uncertainty related to kovitz

415
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,520
to travel restriction we had to organize

416
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,700
a mirror event for participants who had

417
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,580
difficulties traveling to China and

418
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,120
while the organization of FSC in Beijing

419
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,360
it was launched like almost five years

420
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,240
ago the organization of the mirror event

421
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,980
was launched

422
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,280
roughly three months ago and so I would

423
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,120
like to thank akanori and fukank because

424
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,159
they real they take charge of this event

425
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:51,000
in a very very short time and I guess

426
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,580
that finding a room organizing coffee

427
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,740
breaks lunches and even a conference

428
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,020
dinner in such a short time in a few

429
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,679
weeks well that's a real tour force and

430
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,200
this was a great success so thanks a lot

431
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,340
and

432
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,020
because

433
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,679
now it's possible I would like to give

434
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,840
you in person is attack

435
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:28,140
and also we do not forget uh Kay and

436
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,080
Kevin who helped for reorganization

437
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,940
because we have three different places

438
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,940
Kobe Beijing and also the speakers

439
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,940
online so each year we offer them a new

440
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,120
challenge and so but they can always

441
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,760
make it work perfectly so thanks thanks

442
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,820
K and Kevin I guess probably one of them

443
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,720
is here is listen to two words yes so

444
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,360
thanks again as every year it was

445
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,740
perfect

446
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,400
and

447
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,799
so besides a very nice location and good

448
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,059
food they don't like the picture

449
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:14,039
so as a success of the conference it

450
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,280
also comes from the technical program

451
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,220
and selecting very good papers it's

452
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,740
difficult and it's a time consuming task

453
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,740
and and so I would like first to thanks

454
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,280
all members of the Tosca tutorial board

455
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,080
for for their time and for the hard work

456
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,840
and of course a special thank you to

457
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,799
Bart and to uh Christina

458
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,220
I know that handling four issues it

459
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,799
takes the Ontario year and I I guess

460
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,360
that at some point it seems a bit

461
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,700
endless and you did it really in a

462
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,340
remarkable way so thanks a lot and of

463
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,020
course you will get the pledge

464
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,100
thank you

465
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,760
now I need to say a few words about the

466
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,900
FSC steering committee uh because

467
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,980
um we we didn't have any election we

468
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,140
didn't renew vfse steering committee

469
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,600
during uh because of the pandemic

470
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,880
because we would like we we wanted to

471
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,340
have some continuity to handle all these

472
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,360
issues related to covet and so uh this

473
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,240
is a list of the the composition of the

474
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,360
current FSC steering committee so this

475
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,500
committee consists of other as the

476
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,460
is a co-editor-in-chief of task for for

477
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,760
the last four years and also some

478
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,280
electing members and so what happens is

479
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,760
that now uh almost all members in this

480
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,860
list

481
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,360
have uh goes to the Andover term except

482
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,980
Christina itai box and also kazuiko who

483
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:19,700
is or new chair for uh

484
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:26,279
this year and so this means that we have

485
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,640
to renew many different members uh for

486
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,059
this committee and so uh what we suggest

487
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:36,360
is that these members will be elected by

488
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,840
the current steering committee but among

489
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,200
a list of candidates and anyone from the

490
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,779
community can be a candidate or anyone

491
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,880
can nominate a candidate for this you

492
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,679
only have to send me an email because

493
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,260
before the end of May

494
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,279
so if you want to be a member of the FSC

495
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,679
steering committee or to nominate a

496
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,200
member for the steering committee please

497
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,400
send me an email

498
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,520
last but not least what about next FSC

499
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,480
so uh the plan is that we expect to have

500
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,559
the next FSE in Belgium in Louisville so

501
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,900
at the end of March so you have the

502
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,960
dates here this is a plan because this

503
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,020
still needs to be approved by the IRC or

504
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,600
board of directors

505
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,760
and if it is approved then the general

506
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,740
church will be svetlanikova and

507
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:37,020
simondaga and uh you are some pictures

508
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,980
of the venue sent by svetla and for

509
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,960
those who do not know love and it will

510
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,380
be at the train station uh which is

511
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,960
quite close at walking distance uh from

512
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,840
the center of London

513
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,299
and for FSC 2025 we do not have any

514
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:00,120
plans yet so if someone would like to

515
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,940
organize FSC

516
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,220
2025 then you're welcome

517
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,760
so this was my last talk as chair of the

518
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,919
steering committee because we will renew

519
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,159
the steering committee and I must also

520
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,340
add that I'm running for the award for

521
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,340
the best musical presentation but uh for

522
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,679
copyright reason I cannot play any music

523
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:25,440
but maybe I can play a little bit of a

524
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,760
platform thank you

525
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,960
thank you very much so uh we

526
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,620
have we'll move on to the next talk uh

527
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,220
this is a God saved Queen uh clipped

528
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,559
analysis of

529
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:50,960
elderbits-4 by only Jebel

530
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,299
and the talk will be given by Russia

531
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,640
hi everyone uh today I'm going to

532
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,940
present a work in progress entitled God

533
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,100
Save the Queen Crypt analysis of

534
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,960
Elizabeth Ford it's a joint work with

535
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,500
Andreas

536
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:21,779
and I would like to underline the fact

537
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:24,120
that although this is a pretty serious

538
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,700
presentation there is a song in the

539
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,419
title of my my paper so you know and

540
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,400
also just to do a little bit better than

541
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,360
and I'm just going to

542
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,080
there we go okay

543
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:42,120
so a few words about Elizabeth it's a

544
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,460
stream Cipher designed by kosron Hoffman

545
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,620
new and standard that was published at

546
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,279
Asia Crypt 2022 and it is designed to be

547
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,380
efficient in hybrid homomorphic

548
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,000
encryption use cases

549
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,799
the authors claim a security of 128 bits

550
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,200
so I'm going to present an attack that

551
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,799
fully breaks Elizabeth 4 and I hope it's

552
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,740
interesting for two reasons first it's

553
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,779
an example of an optimized linearization

554
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:14,400
attack and also because it uses an

555
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,500
analysis of hhe dedicated features

556
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,419
so about the construction of Elizabeth

557
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,679
IV

558
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,240
the key is made of 256 nibbles that is

559
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,559
4-bit words

560
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,000
that uh and uh sorry and so an IV the IV

561
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,860
is fed to an extendable output function

562
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,100
that outputs uh first a subset of 60

563
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,760
positions of the key register then a

564
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,100
permutation that permutes dispositions

565
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,799
and finally a whitening Vector that is

566
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,260
added to the clinicals

567
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,440
then a filtering function is applied and

568
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,120
outputs a key stream enable

569
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,679
I would like to try and give you just

570
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,320
the main ideas of our linearization

571
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,700
attack

572
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,460
to do so I need to just talk a little

573
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,440
bit about the structure of the filtering

574
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,460
function

575
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,799
so there are 60 kinibles that have been

576
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,220
extracted from the key register and to

577
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,620
simplify just so they are split into 12

578
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,380
sets of five kidney balls

579
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,200
four of these skinny balls are fed to a

580
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,899
function H so here it's h i because it's

581
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,659
actually parameterized by the IV

582
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,899
uh and this function outputs one nibble

583
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:33,720
and the fifth nibble is just added to

584
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,720
the output of this function and then all

585
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,419
the subsequent subsequently obtained

586
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,240
output sorry are added to form the key

587
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,580
stream nibble

588
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,380
so uh first to attack Elizabeth we are

589
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,720
going to focus on the least significant

590
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,960
bits of the output enable for a very

591
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,480
simple reason it's because the addition

592
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,539
in Z16 is simply xor on the least

593
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:03,260
significant bit

594
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:06,000
and then what we do is that we are going

595
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,799
to bound the number the number of

596
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,080
Millennials that can appear in the

597
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,120
expression of the least significant bits

598
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,820
of the key stream nibble

599
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,340
and

600
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,779
this corresponds to the number of linear

601
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,820
variables we are going to have in our

602
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,799
system

603
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,899
in the linear system we want to solve

604
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:26,760
so um

605
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,020
at the input so remember that the key is

606
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,460
256 nibbles

607
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,440
and uh so the an H takes as input for uh

608
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,919
nibbles so the maximum number of four

609
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:43,679
nibble vectors that can be at the input

610
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,659
of an h i function is 4 among 256 and

611
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,899
for a fixed uh foreign Vector uh the

612
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,000
number of monomials that can appear in

613
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,500
the least significant bits of the

614
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,159
outputs of an h i is 2 to the power 16.

615
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:02,340
but as you can tell if we just do a

616
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,860
naive linearization attack we do not

617
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,220
fully break Elizabeth for yet

618
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,620
so to improve our attack we are going to

619
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,440
use a handful of improvements so first

620
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,360
we showed that the linear system we

621
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,880
obtain is in fact various parts and we

622
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,320
can exploit this to improve the

623
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,320
complexity of the attack

624
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,980
then

625
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,100
we analyze hhe dedicated features and we

626
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,260
leverage some of their properties to

627
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,559
improve the complexity again and finally

628
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,600
we can do pre-computation based

629
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,279
trade-offs

630
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,299
um I've given a little example here

631
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:42,360
so this allows us to obtain an attack

632
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,360
that has time complexity 2 to the power

633
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,520
90 operations and a pretty reasonable

634
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,159
memory complexities memory and data

635
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:54,440
complexities

636
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,600
uh thank you for your attention and if

637
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,580
you have any questions please feel free

638
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,879
to ask

639
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,080
thank you very much so we moved to the

640
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,439
next talk

641
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,299
so the next talk is about as level

642
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:24,179
secure prf by Antonio Lawless UT Les

643
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:27,080
gregoranda

644
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:33,419
will give us that all thank you uh

645
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,899
that's the

646
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:39,299
so

647
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:43,080
so you all know as Cipher this is one of

648
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,019
the greatest safer it's uh it's a very

649
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,480
secure it's a random permutation it has

650
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,240
10 rounds and everyone uses so no need

651
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,519
to to present it but you see there's

652
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,559
some kind of weird thing now it doesn't

653
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,840
fit my slide right I have to go back a

654
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,200
line and but there's a way to fix this

655
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,179
is this Construction

656
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:06,299
so now everything fits and that is

657
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:09,839
actually a random function so there's a

658
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,339
lot of in a lot of case you know you

659
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:12,960
want a random function they are better

660
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,239
than permutation because it's just uh

661
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,020
keeper for like asgcm and everything

662
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,820
goes beyond the best day one and it's

663
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,399
great and uh you can see it's secure

664
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:26,099
because you have uh five and five runs

665
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:29,040
so that's ten runs and if you take if

666
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,500
you take above and below a value here at

667
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,879
the at the end you see that they are

668
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,099
separated by five rounds five rounds

669
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,800
five five runs so there are computers in

670
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,980
the system in the requestible

671
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:44,399
them you get a random uh random value so

672
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,800
that's uh that's super great and this

673
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,440
construction is you know probably secure

674
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,179
um context this recognition is very

675
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,099
interesting because you can prove that

676
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:55,679
also five prefixes to be equal to 10 so

677
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,900
prefer does not really equal eight

678
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,140
because here you can use you can use a

679
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,980
integral attack on Far runs above and

680
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,900
below at the same time and you have even

681
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,780
some neighbors that overlaps on two to

682
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,820
the 48 queries you can you have a

683
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,380
distinguisher on this

684
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,140
so so

685
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,640
yeah you're amazingly for profile does

686
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,099
not equal eight not in all the case I

687
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,839
mean if you think about again on

688
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,760
restricted input

689
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,280
like for example the counter unless you

690
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,500
unless you encrypt your content in very

691
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,119
weird way you probably won't be able to

692
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,980
do these things you can distinguisher

693
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,500
attack that needs to you need to

694
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,599
manipulate the most significant and the

695
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,800
least significant bit at the same time

696
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,079
it's not possible so maybe even this

697
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,820
construction is secure beyond the stable

698
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,619
you don't know

699
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,720
but what we really like is this

700
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,780
construction so it's uh it's super

701
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,520
they're great because you can you

702
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,500
actually with a you know the native

703
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,839
instruction in AES that makes AES

704
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:56,760
compute really fast you can actually

705
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,460
compute two a yes in parallel with those

706
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,740
instructions you can even do in parallel

707
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,099
forward and backward round so like yeah

708
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,859
let's uh Native in question can do that

709
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:12,060
like in uh in in five five cycle you you

710
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:15,000
compute everything and uh on one

711
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,520
instruction you do you do both uh you do

712
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,520
both R and R inverse at the same time so

713
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,700
it's really perfect and I tell it to you

714
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,060
to attack this but let me know that we

715
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,820
explain experimentally verified and 555

716
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,300
is into it equal 10. so we claim is

717
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,460
level security on this and we think it's

718
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,560
really uh it's really the most simple

719
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,800
prf construction that that can be done

720
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,400
with all these as run function

721
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,180
thank you

722
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,460
thank you very much

723
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,359
so we moved to the next talk

724
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:00,420
uh the next talk is CCA security with

725
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,960
short tax and the talk is given by

726
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,160
Mustafa Kerala

727
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,480
thank you

728
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,020
so this topic is not really a new topic

729
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,880
so it has been studied the CTA security

730
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,160
of AED schemes so there is this famous

731
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,280
bound from 2000 which says that the CCA

732
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,940
security of AED schemes is bounded by

733
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,820
the CBA security and the Integrity bound

734
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,640
but this was discussed during the nist

735
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,940
lightweight cryptography competition

736
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:36,180
on the mailing list and last FSE I had a

737
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,920
paper where I analyzed the attack that

738
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,780
was described in the mailing list and

739
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,820
also showed that the bound is tied for

740
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,000
CEO of P scheme particularly

741
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,880
subsequently in this FSE in the next two

742
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,619
days there is another paper that also

743
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,619
has similar conclusion and they show

744
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:56,160
that the bound is also tied for Roka and

745
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,680
they show that it is possible to have a

746
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,359
bound that's not tight in the Integrity

747
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:02,820
if you have an encoding in Cipher scheme

748
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,099
but it only works for

749
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:07,200
it only works efficiently for fixed

750
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,839
fixed plain text lens after that you

751
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,300
need the expensive inciphering scheme to

752
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,460
be able to do that

753
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,040
so the first thing I want observation I

754
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,099
want to present here is that

755
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:23,640
the generalization doesn't work if the

756
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,040
if the tag length is fixed because if

757
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,900
the tag lens is fixed then you have an

758
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,480
attack where you try to forge an empty

759
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,760
plain text and then you try to encrypt

760
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,040
it and if it's a if it's an ideal

761
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,780
encryption it's a outputs random

762
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,760
strength then at some point you will get

763
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,220
something that leads to invalid plain

764
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,900
text but you get the same Cipher text

765
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,000
from the encryption later so you will be

766
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,420
bound by Lambda and you can show that if

767
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,740
you set a

768
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,760
fixed like a minimum plain text lens and

769
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,700
you have a random injection then you can

770
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,680
have a security that's the minimum the

771
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,960
index lens plus the tag lens in this

772
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,660
case it's zero so it's just the tag lens

773
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,240
so yeah if you want the security with

774
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,520
fixed plan fixed stretch or fixed tag

775
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,560
lens you have to have a minimum blind

776
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,960
text glance the second thing is that

777
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,579
because these papers talk about online

778
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,520
AAA schemes

779
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,920
the natural next Target is

780
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,460
offline is like SIV which is a toolbar

781
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,140
scheme your first Mac

782
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,200
the a plain text and then you use the IV

783
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,720
from the Mac as a IV for an ncba

784
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,880
encryption and then you get the

785
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,560
encryption of them

786
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,780
so there is also an attack on this with

787
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,260
the tag lens where instead of trying to

788
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,579
guess the tag you try to guess the

789
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,260
ciphertext corresponding to the tag and

790
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,940
you can choose the ciphertext long to be

791
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,240
to be the ciphertext lens to be long

792
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,940
so you fix the IV and then you try to

793
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,619
get a ciphertext that corresponds to

794
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:55,380
that IV and this IV already appeared in

795
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,320
one encryption query and

796
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,780
because you fix the IV then the

797
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,839
decryption becomes online because

798
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,880
this is just will be the same case

799
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,980
stream and if you get if you get the

800
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,540
cipher text then you leak the key stream

801
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,859
and you can decrypt the message you

802
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:12,540
encrypted at the beginning and the

803
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,579
probability of getting such forgery is

804
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,119
depends on the tag lens

805
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:21,000
so from this observation we know that we

806
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,160
have if we want to fix tag lens we have

807
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,900
the blind text must have minimum length

808
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,800
and if we have something like SIV and

809
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,720
the IV can be controlled and the scheme

810
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,180
is not NCCA secure the encryption scheme

811
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,640
then it also doesn't work so the natural

812
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,280
next Target is Riv which was proposed in

813
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,980
2016 by these authors and the goal was

814
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,839
to have security with release of

815
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,760
Amplified plain text

816
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,280
so here we have a nuns based variant of

817
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,000
that

818
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,880
and I think like basically it's more

819
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,560
generalized we use different Keys

820
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,480
everywhere and we have announced and if

821
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,060
we consider an unrespecting adversary I

822
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,760
think that this will have

823
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,079
NCCA Securities that's double the tag

824
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,079
lens so now we can have the tag lens and

825
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,820
get the same privacy

826
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,960
and the reason it works is because

827
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,460
you need to satisfy two conditions at

828
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,619
the same time so to break the NCCA

829
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:15,660
security of this encryption scheme you

830
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,420
need to repeat the IV but also you need

831
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,119
to have this ivb corresponding to the

832
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,760
correct message and to satisfy those

833
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,560
posts at the same time if everything is

834
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,960
secure then it will be double the double

835
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,520
the tag lens

836
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,000
last thing I want to mention is that the

837
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,040
schema that was proposed in the Roka

838
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,260
Crypt analysis paper is uh uses as 256

839
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,740
bit to equal block Cipher to get 256 bit

840
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:47,220
NC NCCA I think that there are ways to

841
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,680
optimize it to use a have the block size

842
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,800
but with a larger tweak where but again

843
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,560
this only works for a fixed index type

844
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,740
so you encrypt the message first to get

845
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,660
an IV and then you encrypt the message

846
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,579
again but with IV as a tweak so it's

847
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:05,040
like SIV but with fixed lens but now

848
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,400
this encryption is NCCA secure so it

849
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,720
should be the same security as the

850
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,420
encoding in Cipher and I think there is

851
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,160
another way but it's more complicated so

852
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,079
I don't present it here to I can discuss

853
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,940
it after if someone is interested to

854
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,480
even have us have the block size with

855
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,180
the original two weeks two week size but

856
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,800
you will require four calls to do that

857
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,000
not two calls thanks

858
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,300
thank you very much

859
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,460
so the next

860
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,400
talk is about step symmetric techniques

861
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,700
for advanced protocols and the talk is

862
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,420
given by Leo thank you well pretty much

863
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,980
all of it is in the title

864
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,260
so the questions I'm trying to answer

865
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,300
here well not here actually it will be

866
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,520
in new as you will see why would anyone

867
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,040
want symmetric Primitives over FP I

868
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,839
found F2 pretty comfortable since you

869
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,520
cannot make any sign mistakes and also

870
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,500
we have literature on the topic

871
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,480
but it turns out there are actually good

872
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,920
reasons to do that

873
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,260
but when it's the case what do we need

874
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,000
to know when working in these fields

875
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,980
because when you go from F2 to FP there

876
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,839
are quite a few things that change

877
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:19,920
well

878
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,500
I hope to provide some answers or rather

879
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,660
to have people provide us the answers at

880
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,640
step Workshop

881
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,560
I was also trying to get an artistic

882
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,300
price for this REM session talk by

883
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,119
having my students do a logo for me so

884
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,380
thank you most but apparently it's not

885
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,579
going to work it's only music right

886
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:40,380
so again it will be in Lyon actually

887
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,819
where I studied

888
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,920
um it's going to be the weekend just

889
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,319
before FS eurocrypt not FSC not to be

890
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,240
bit late so the weekend just before you

891
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,500
recrypt and how to get there or how to

892
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,359
register in this instance you need to

893
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,819
sign up when you register for eurocrypt

894
00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:00,300
I have put a tentative outline of the

895
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,819
schedule it's a bit complicated because

896
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:05,660
it will be invited talks and I will have

897
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,520
guests who will tell us about algebraic

898
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,839
attacks Starks how to design and use

899
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:15,900
permutations for AFP how to actually do

900
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,359
the arithmetic arithmetization step in a

901
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:20,460
zero knowledge protocol

902
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,619
also about sectional resilience which

903
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,060
was not something I expected to be

904
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,180
relevant here but actually it really is

905
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,880
fhe symmetric design and also topic dear

906
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,319
to me

907
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:34,160
standardization

908
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,359
I was not expecting that

909
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:42,300
well anyway here's the URL you can also

910
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,980
find it on the eurocrypt website and I'm

911
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,420
going to run away before the ghosts get

912
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,440
me thank you

913
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,440
problem

914
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,440
test

915
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,020
test

916
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:23,540
it's okay okay all right so uh

917
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,299
okay

918
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:42,200
the meanwhile please read the slide

919
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,359
okay I'll use it okay okay so uh let's

920
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,040
continue the next talk is about the

921
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,920
third nist workshop on block Cipher

922
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,579
moves of operation 2023 by Nikki moha

923
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:56,099
and Nikki will give us oh please thank

924
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:57,839
you tetsu so I have a workshop

925
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,700
announcement as well uh the workshop

926
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,440
will be held on the other side of the

927
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,140
world with a 13 hour time difference so

928
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,760
I'm the only person here of actually a

929
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,880
quite big team in DC working on this uh

930
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,520
sent over to tell everybody please come

931
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,220
to DC at the end of the year so we're

932
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,460
having a workshop on October 3 and 4 at

933
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,859
the national cyber security Center of

934
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:22,380
Excellence which is a building that is

935
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,400
uh part of this but closer to DC

936
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,200
newer nicer building

937
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,740
um

938
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,460
the workshop will be related to

939
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:36,180
um the upcoming standardization of uh

940
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,880
new modes of operation so we're

941
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,380
discussing what type of mode of

942
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,460
operation that would be what

943
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,780
requirements would be and what the

944
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,460
problems with the existing modes are

945
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,520
just today there has been a document

946
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,520
released nist IR

947
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,920
8459 that discusses

948
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,579
um

949
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:55,740
the issues with the current modes of

950
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,200
operation and the possibility of

951
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,020
standardizing uh tweakable White

952
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,079
encryption technique so white like the

953
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,359
width will be the width of the entire

954
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:09,060
plain text so in the case of the Caesar

955
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,839
competition I think only aez was the

956
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,720
submission that satisfied this property

957
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,700
so please send your submissions the

958
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,599
definition deadline is July 1 2023.

959
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,220
um here you see notification July 30

960
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,380
Workshop will be held October 3 and 4

961
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,839
and below are some links to find more

962

information thank you

963
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,160
thank you very much so uh we switch the

964
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,640
screen to uh Beijing so uh one moment

965
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,879
please

966
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:05,000
Eileen we see the screen

967
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,180
yes please

968
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:17,640
okay we switched to the Beijing Bernie

969
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,040
the next talk

970
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,859
is entitled new records in Collision

971
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:30,720
attacks on ripe MD 160 and shot 256 uh

972
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,900
engine will give the talk

973
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,819
welcome

974
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:36,900
okay

975
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,740
okay our our new records include

976
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,260
includes attacks on rapid Avenue 160

Anderson uh two five six the cosence is

978
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:58,399
uh our result our results are online

979
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,900
too many results the first is the

980
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,819
professor we found the first practical

981
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:15,079
pleaser for 40 steps for our rapid md160

982
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:19,200
is the first record practical semi-free

983
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,260
stock please and for uh 39 steps of

984

the year world

990
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,640
uh the program the program to fund the

991
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,780
program to funnel uh similar freestyle

992
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:53,599

stable still function under the message

1001
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,500
is bound

1002
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,660
expansion

1003
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,940
we found that in we found that by

1004
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,920
injecting difference in the new message

1005
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,260
was

1006
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:50,220
m0m2m11 and M12 we can construct a

1007
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,920
a local cleansing for the

1008
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,880
foreign

1009
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:00,059
steps under uh

1010
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:01,559
under

1011
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:05,760
the last 16 steps on the post on the

1012
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,819
left launcher

1013
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:10,440
um such that uh

1014
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,220
such as that awake or cleanser attacker

1015
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:19,619
clear the attacker on the 40 steps md160

1016
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:21,720
is possible

1017
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,140
with our shs smt

1018
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:28,380
Vista to we can we have been funded

1019
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,500
funders are 40

1020
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,319
steps uh different differential

1021
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,160

1022
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,400

Freedom degree uh utility

1025
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:08,700
we pray we presented the first law

1026
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,760
we presented the first cleaning message

1027
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,140

1028
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,940

1030
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:22,280
uh

1031
00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:25,339
um

1032
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,780
it's a it's a run function another

1033
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:33,440
message expansion are much more complex

1034
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,380
which makes it a difficulty to fund

1035
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,420
um Pleasant generating differential

1036
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,420
characteristics

1037
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,839
advisor is

1038
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:50,119
is inspired by the

1039
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,640
39512

1040
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,839
semi-free stock laser attacker

1041
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,150
the message differences

1042
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:07,409
[Music]

1043
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,480
different characteristics

1044
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,280
for 39th is establish a shot 256 at

1045
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,800
showing the table

1046
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,520
we use the Motoring

1047
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:27,319
technique to avoid the contradiction

1048
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:35,720
then we use our SAT and SATs empty big

1049
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,520
based method to fund the conforming

1050
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,180
message pair

1051
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,800
display our result

1052
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:55,440
uh 100 pmg160 and South 256. okay that's

1053
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,980
awesome thank you

1054
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:13,520
hello everyone uh we we Andrew villain

1055
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,400
and me would like to you uh to join a

1056
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,640
lovely relativity Workshop

1057
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,460
so what are the T stands for

1058
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,520
hand release encryption and its

1059
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,440
application it is an international

1060
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,160
Workshop to be held in Oxford United

1061
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,400
Kingdom so we are sponsored by

1062
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,400
crypto.com

1063
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:44,460
but the data is June uh 26 to 27 uh it

1064
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,880
will be held in Oxford and the host is

1065
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,460
Department of computer science Oxford

1066
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,400
University and it's also colonized by

1067
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,440
blockchain Research Center China

1068
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:01,339
university you can see the website

1069
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,680
wanted to go is to promote the research

1070
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,839
in the field a lot of time the release

1071
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:09,780
encryption and its application so time

1072
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,780
the release time the releasing provision

1073
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,720
so the main goal is to make software

1074
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,780
encryption slow again

1075
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:24,240
while uh more precise we hope to uh the

1076
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,579
Technologies hope to make the

1077
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:28,980
encouraging uh the time more

1078
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,240
controllable

1079
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,460
well yet it's still

1080
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,619
in the scope of symmetrical key

1081
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:37,500
encryption so you can combine the The

1082
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,440
Matrix inclusion and the time consuming

1083
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,640
components

1084
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,720
and also uh similar Primitives time the

1085
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,180
commitment time the puzzle

1086
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,940
and all the all of these Primitives have

1087
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,579
applications to security protocols

1088
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:56,760
blockchain and we welcome your ideas on

1089
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,619
design analysis and implementation

1090
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,680
we expect to bring uh researchers from

1091
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,140
around the world uh the speakers are

1092
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,079
mainly invited but if you have very good

1093
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,440
ideas they are open and excited to hear

1094
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,339
it

1095
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:17,040
and all audience are open to generic

1096
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,960
public

1097

please contact us as soon as possible to

1098
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,119
reserve a spot

1099
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:28,500
again this is the information and if you

1100
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,040
are interested to give a talk or to

1101
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,800
attend the workshop police contact with

1102
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,280
the album thank you

1103
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,000
thank you

1104
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,540
the next talk is entitled The Things

1105
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,819
Asian workshop on symmetric key

1106
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:52,319
cryptography

1107
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:55,319
foreign

1108
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:01,740
workshop on signature key cryptography

1109
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,380
they ask 2023

1110
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,020
and so

1111
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,059
you need something today

1112
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,640
so the day will be from December 9 to 11

1113
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,619
and this year and jokes after the

1114
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:15,420
election Club 2023

1115
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,400
and the rating will be in jidai

1116
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,440
University Guangzhou China

1117
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,900
so you can connect me or being sung for

1118
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,760
more information and the website is

1119
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,800
already online but we will update the

1120
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,900
information soon

1121
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,359
and so the government asked

1122
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:32,760
is to promote a research on symmetry

1123
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,520
cryptography in azure the topic will be

1124
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,099
including processor strange Cipher hash

1125
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:40,500
function most operation and they are

1126
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,780
corresponding analysis design proofs and

1127
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:46,079
implementations any researcher on even

1128
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,359
no Fascination is welcome for

1129
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:50,940
participants we also provide limited

1130
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,579
number of sleep and PhD students who

1131
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:57,720
have difficulty attending the fundings

1132
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,420
and the format asked will be the morning

1133
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,660
we will be the United talk sessions we

1134
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,880
invited respectable speakers to

1135
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,880
introduce the advanced results and also

1136
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,520
the survey on popular topics and in the

1137
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,260
afternoon we will divide the

1138
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,020
participants in working groups and there

1139
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,540
will be some small uh Discussion Group

1140
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,240
working on a particular research topic

1141
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,099
and the goal is to face their

1142
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,520
corporations

1143
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,280
is in uh 2011 uh in Singapore by jiangu

1144
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,920
and Thomas and then Japan China India

1145
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,900
Singapore Japan China and India Japan

1146
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:40,500
and due to recovery the 2020 and from

1147
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:44,880
Community to 2022 are canceled

1148
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,280
uh there's some publication related to

1149
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,299
us some people in the uhm menu of main

1150
00:58:51,299 --> 00:58:52,980
conference also many people in the

1151
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:56,540
embassy also in Alabama relaxed

1152
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:59,940
acsps or the SEC although in the Juno

1153
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,339
like iesc or design course and

1154
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:03,960
cryptography

1155
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,799
uh we also have some Statics

1156
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:09,660
regarding the venue control control is

1157
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,880
very famous for his 3D support and also

1158
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,640
tourist attraction for the food I think

1159
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,020
they are more than one thousand being

1160
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,839
some and also thousands of places

1161
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:21,780
and for a tourist attraction uh I think

1162
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:25,260
more than uh 223 million visitor will

1163
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,839
come to uh Guangzhou uh just for

1164
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:30,059
traveling and you can reach the content

1165
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:33,359
Tower I made a museum or Paradise

1166
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:36,859
