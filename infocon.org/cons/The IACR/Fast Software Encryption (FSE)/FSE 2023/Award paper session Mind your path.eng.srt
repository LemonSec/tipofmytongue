1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,179
so the paper is entitled mind your pass

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,460
on key dependencies in differential

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,000
characteristics the paper is by Thomas

4
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,660
okay and I think we are ready to start

5
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,919
is presenting the paper

6
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,160
thank you for the introduction so once

7
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,619
again my name is chin chin and uh this

8
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:05,700
is the title of this talk is actually

9
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,380
minor puff on key dependencies in

10
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,060
differential characteristics and this is

11
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,100
a joint work with Thomas Perry and we

12
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,020
are from uh Technological University

13
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,240
Singapore

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,299
so actually before we go into the

15
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,860
details of the paper itself let's go

16
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,420
through some preliminaries and since

17
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,460
this is just a second talk of this

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,680
conference I will start off easy and we

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,000
will start off with like what's the

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,100
basics of uh differential crypto nurses

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,320
in general

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,840
so for crypto Genesis in general what we

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,759
really want is that let's say we have a

24
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,860
kid function or Cipher we want to

25
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,900
actually recover the key for key

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,060
recovery attack to get for a particular

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,040
pin text to the ciphertext itself

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,500
so how we actually do it is that uh we

29
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,939
usually want to find a distinguisher

30
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,640
that covers the majority of the rounds

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,520
and then uh afterwards at the front of

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,259
the bank we can add a key recovery round

33
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,079
which will actually let us recover the

34
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,100
key

35
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,320
so for differential characteristics uh

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,180
differential equipment analysis itself

37
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,619
what we really want is that a

38
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,439
distinguisher that have a probability of

39
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,119
a certain Delta in a difference in the

40
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,979
input leads to a difference in output

41
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,239
Delta out

42
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,340
and in order for the key recovery attack

43
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,620
to actually perform we usually look for

44
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,599
a distinguisher with a probability

45
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,000
that's pretty high so note that actually

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,500
even though we have to maximum of the

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,819
probability of distinguisher doesn't

48
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,319
really mean that the key recovery is the

49
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,120
best but at least it gives us a rough

50
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,760
gauge of like how the distinguished how

51
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,400
how prone or susceptible the cipher is

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,840
to differential cryptolysis

53
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,160
so now we have two questions over here

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,900
the first one is that how do you

55
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,239
actually find a delta in a data out that

56
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,280
guarantees a good probability for the

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,440
distinguisher and the second thing is

58
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,580
that how do we actually find the

59
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,000
probability of the distinguisher itself

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,580
so if you if you break down the ciphers

61
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,800
into many portions what we can see is

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,239
that actually the probability is a

63
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,540
summation of a lot of paths

64
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,780
so know that uh I actually lift out the

65
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,760
values over there so actually in in the

66
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,900
actual case it actually depends on

67
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,940
values and everything

68
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,640
so this is uh made up of a lot of laws

69
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,800
different paths but the thing is in

70
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,920
reality we would not be able to actually

71
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,519
uh exhaustively search for all the paths

72
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,560
so most of the time what we'll do is

73
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,000
that we just look at one of the dominant

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,500
differential characteristics

75
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,140
so we just evaluate the one of the paths

76
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,260
itself and usually what we do is that we

77
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,879
look at this differential characteristic

78
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,159
and we we have a rough sketch of like

79
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,080
how good the differential is or at the

80
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,420
very least it gives a lower bound on the

81
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,920
probability of the distinguisher

82
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,659
so now the question will become how do

83
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,299
we actually compute the probability

84
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,760
so for this we have to rely on the other

85
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,500
assumption which is the Markov Cipher

86
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,299
assumption which states that the

87
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,799
differential probability of the wrong

88
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,900
function will be independent of the

89
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,180
value that's assuming if the sub key

90
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,459
that's input to the wrong function is

91
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,459
actually uniformly uniformly random

92
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,440
so under this assumption what we can do

93
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,879
is that we can split this probability

94
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,939
into a product of probabilities assuming

95
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,220
they are all independent

96
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,040
so once we know that we can we can

97
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,839
evaluate the probabilities round by

98
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,220
round the next thing is that we can

99
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,139
actually use a lot of the tools that we

100
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,060
actually know such that the DDT or like

101
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,800
automated methods to actually find a

102
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,780
good Delta in and Delta out for the

103
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,559
distinguisher itself

104
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,660
so now the question is is the Markov

105
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,000
Cipher assumption actually valid so for

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,440
this we have to look at the premise of

107
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,139
the Assumption itself which is that we

108
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,180
have to make sure that the sub key is

109
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,979
uniformly random

110
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:47,580
but in actual reality when we uh when we

111
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,199
perform like key recovery attacks the

112
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,000
key is often fixed

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,460
so this means that actually the value of

114
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,460
a certain round actually depends on the

115
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,020
value of the previous rounds

116
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,660
so this is actually noted in a lot of

117
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,759
the papers previously so for examples

118
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,199
when you deal with like permutations or

119
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,240
hash functions they do not have any key

120
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,639
input or you can treat them as like a

121
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,880
key of like all zeros so uh in these

122
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,740
cases actually for the characteristics

123
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,979
they might not actually vote at all

124
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,620
and also for the Five Stone networks and

125
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,560
everything so control at all in FSC 2017

126
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,940
also

127
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,139
it's like

128
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,680
also um do a in-depth analysis on like

129
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,120
Firestone Network for three rounds and

130
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,340
finding the exact probability

131
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,240
and in DCC 2020 and Liu at all also

132
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,639
introducing real characteristics so this

133
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,740
these are the characteristics that uh

134
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,539
actually work in terms of based on all

135
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,280
the assumptions that we have but in

136
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,780
reality there are no keys that actually

137
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,759
allow this characteristic to pass so

138
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,080
later on we actually look at the one of

139
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,460
the cases of a singular characteristic

140
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,500
as well

141
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,440
so for the case of lvd the analysis will

142
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,240
be extremely careful has to be extremely

143
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,340
careful because of the step function

144
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,440
which is essentially a four round AES

145
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,960
like Cipher uh sorry four round AES

146
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,900
wrong function uh but the thing is for

147
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,759
each of the for for the for the each of

148
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,400
the four rounds uh within itself there's

149
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,680
only addition of wrong constants instead

150
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
of like a key

151
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,900
so also on ARX ciphers there are also

152
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,639
many works that help to they are develop

153
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,380
developing tools to actually find out

154
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,819
like whether a characteristics is it

155
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,220
valid or not or like to improve the

156
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,020
correctness of the characteristics

157
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,180
so we will now look at like the wrong

158
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,819
function of skinny so skinny is a

159
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:38,220
trickable box Cipher and a block size is

160
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,759
either 64 bits or 2128 bit so it

161
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,199
actually follows a structure of similar

162
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,419
to like what AES is doing so each of the

163
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,280
cell is actually either a nibble or a

164
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,539
bite

165
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,639
so for the three key size itself it's

166
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,680
either one time two time or three times

167
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,900
the size of the block size also known as

168
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,199
the tk1 tk2 and tk3 version

169
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,840
so one one thing to note is the key

170
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,699
schedule over here so the key schedule

171
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,020
is rather simple

172
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,479
uh for each of the so for each of the

173
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,120
tk1tk to tk3 there will be a permutation

174
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,160
so this is just a transposition of like

175
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,479
the cells

176
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,120
and then within each cell itself there

177
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,100
will be an lfsr for half of the states

178
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,919
so it enables or eight bytes having an

179
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,359
alpha after each round

180
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,940
so now we look at the motivation for

181
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,460
this paper itself so what we want to do

182
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,840
is actually to find out what actually

183
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,520
goes on underneath all these

184
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,740
dependencies on the keys and I really

185
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,819
want to find out all the possible

186
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,400
constraints and lead to the necessary

187
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,840
conditions on the key

188
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,520
so when the dependencies are not too

189
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,500
complex which generally when the

190
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,360
characteristic is not so dense or the

191
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,160
probability is pretty good is the case

192
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,860
uh you want to actually know the the

193
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,780
size of the key space

194
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,340
as well as the probability distribution

195
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,380
of the characteristic itself

196
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,780
the next thing is you want the search

197
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,300
method that actually uh allows us to

198
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,500
actually incorporate all these

199
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,300
constraints that we have we'll be

200
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,280
talking with afterwards so that we can

201
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,020
actually find characteristics that avoid

202
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,080
having uh this singular characteristics

203
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,800
components

204
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,979
so we'll look at example of a skinny so

205
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,099
on top you'll see a round function a

206
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,580
round of skin itself so note that the

207
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,620
cells highlighted are actually the cells

208
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,879
that we are interested in for this case

209
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,099
so we look at we will focus on the

210
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,640
yellow highlighted cells so once we have

211
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,860
taken out from the wrong function it's

212
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,200
on the bottom left over there what we

213
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,299
can see is that uh okay so note for the

214
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,919
numbers inside the

215
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,380
cells itself is actually differences so

216
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,920
what you can see is that uh based on the

217
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,420
differences and everything we can deduce

218
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,459
what are the values that are required at

219
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,899
the particular input or output of the

220
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:52,920
Xbox

221
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,839
so in this case what we'll look at is

222
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,360
the transition from D to 2 there are

223
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,279
only four values alone as well as from

224
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,600
two to five there are only four values

225
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,519
allowed so for in this case we can

226
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,080
actually deduce that what are the keys

227
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,899
that will actually allow this this uh

228
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,920
this propagation to go through

229
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,940
we can also do the same thing for the

230
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,160
ones in the Ping as well so in this case

231
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,320
what we can see is that the key cell

232
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,660
that's involved in both constraints are

233
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,980
actually the same

234
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,200
so in this case what we have to do is to

235
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,760
get the intersection of it and see how

236
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,940
many keys are actually allowing this to

237
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,160
um constraints to pass so in this case

238
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,480
you can see that intersection has

239
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,339
nothing over there which means that

240
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,380
actually for this particular round there

241
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,899
won't be any uh keys that allow this

242
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,880
characteristic to pass through

243
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,560
and this is also a type of singular

244
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,360
characteristic

245
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,519
so we call this kind of constraints the

246
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,140
linear constraints mainly because they

247
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,959
do not actually involve any s boxes in

248
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,120
the middle but it's just the output and

249
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,620
or the input of the Xbox itself

250
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,640
the other type of constraints that we

251
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,560
call the non-linear constraints so these

252
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,640
are the constraints that actually

253
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,700
involve a

254
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,779
inactive s-box as you can see

255
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,940
highlighted in green over there so these

256
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,519
constraints are often being not because

257
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,220
even though over here that's is inactive

258
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,959
but it doesn't mean that the values are

259
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,720
you can choose any values that you want

260
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,800
uh usually this kind of constraints

261
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
arise when you have some sort of

262
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,700
cancellations happen before that so in

263
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,839
this case you can see that after the

264
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,760
propagation from two to five for both

265
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,980
cells they actually cancel off and the

266
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,240
difference is actually zero

267
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,580
so for this kind of constraints the the

268
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,380
constraints on the key itself is a

269
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,120
little bit more complicated because

270
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,040
there are two keys involved and it's a

271
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,100
non-linear interaction so what we can do

272
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,660
is to list down all the tuples that we

273
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,920
can we have over here

274
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,380
so the next kind of constraints is the

275
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,180
higher order constraints

276
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,459
um so basically for this kind of cases

277
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,380
what we have over here is that we have

278
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,620
two or more output values instead output

279
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,480
cells instead of the previous one where

280
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,860
we always stick with just one output

281
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,300
cell

282
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,519
so in this kind of constraints for

283
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,339
skinny especially it can involve the key

284
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,560
or it may not involve the key at all so

285
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,360
in this case uh you can see that

286
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,820
actually the X and the key itself is

287
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,800
involved in two constraints so once you

288
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,120
actually combine them together the key

289
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,220
doesn't really matter anymore and what

290
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,060
happens is just the the the values they

291
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,500
are in deeply

292
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,760
so once we have identified all the

293
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,380
constraints via an algorithm and

294
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,700
everything the next thing is that we

295
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,680
want to actually compute like how does

296
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,240
it or how does this constraints actually

297
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,940
change the key space as well as the

298
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,820
probability probability distribution

299
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,680
so ideally what we want to do is that we

300
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,000
want to com we want to take all these

301
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,740
constraints and evaluate them at one

302
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,560
goal but usually when the characteristic

303
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,540
is long we have a lot of constraints and

304
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,220
it's really hard to actually evaluate

305
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,540
them all together

306
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,160
so what we have to do is to break them

307
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,680
into groups and ideally hope that these

308
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,000
groups are actually independent of each

309
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,339
other and we can compute the probability

310
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,060
individually

311
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,800
so these are the cons these are the

312
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,420
conditions that we actually use to group

313
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,180
them together so first of all if they

314
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,339
sell one key cell together up to the key

315
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,500
schedule so note that the skinny key

316
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,060
schedule is actually pretty simple so

317
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,040
each of the label or the bytes actually

318
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,959
stay with within itself and they will

319
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:25,560
not mixed with other nipples or bytes

320
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,360
the next thing is that if they also

321
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,760
share one Xbox together so one of the

322
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,200
transition one of the values that they

323
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,240
they so for example one constraint the

324
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,220
output is the input of the next

325
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,620
constraint then these two constraints

326
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,700
will be together in the same group

327
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,260
so of course after we're dividing all

328
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,519
these groups and everything there might

329
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,380
be a chance that it is still huge too

330
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,139
huge for us to actually compute so uh

331
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,579
when the groups are small enough we can

332
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,740
actually just straight away compute the

333
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,779
change in the probability but let's say

334
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,940
if the groups are slightly larger what

335
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,800
we can do is to further optimize it

336
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,920
optimizing it so note that for skinny

337
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,600
itself they are ticketing and tk3

338
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,760
versions so this means that actually uh

339
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,260
so note that when we when you find the

340
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,360
key constraints the constraints on the

341
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,100
key are the ones that after you exit all

342
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,940
together

343
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,560
but the thing is once you actually

344
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,060
expand it out to a ticket to a ticket

345
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,639
version it's actually a higher that

346
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,019
there's actually more

347
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,220
um Dimensions to play with

348
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,519
so this so for example uh let's say if

349
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,980
the key for is not allowed in a

350
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,440
particular round n minus one uh after

351
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,100
after you expand it out into the tk2 OR

352
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,680
tk3 version and you pass through with

353
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,440
Alpha Sr actually the allows it actually

354
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,300
split the

355
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,820
um the impossible key into like all the

356
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,740
other values this is also thanks to the

357
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,139
lfsr itself so essentially let's say you

358
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:50,519
have two constraints on two different

359
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,740
rounds

360
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,260
um working on the same key they will not

361
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,180
actually they will interact in the

362
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,920
uniform way such that like the

363
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,699
probability can be speed

364
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,459
so the next thing is that let's say if

365
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,740
we let's say if we have we did a reading

366
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,060
a group itself there are two constraints

367
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,399
that actually only have one Xbox

368
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,019
overlapping so what we can do is that we

369
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,339
can split these two constraints into two

370
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,079
different groups and we evaluate the

371
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,600
probability sequentially so we evaluate

372
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,399
the top first and then based on the

373
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,899
values that are there a lot for the

374
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,459
first constraint we apply it to a second

375
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:27,000
constraint so we only choose we only

376
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,620
split a group when there's only one one

377
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,480
Xbox in common because if there are two

378
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,180
two or more s boxes in play there might

379
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,480
be some correlations that are preventing

380
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,680
the values from appearing

381
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,600
so once again if Let's see we after this

382
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,300
optimizations we still cannot uh eval

383
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,000
evaluate it theoretically we can do an

384
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,720
experimental search

385
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
so this is a summary of the results for

386
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,980
skinny I don't put a table over here

387
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,160
because it's pretty huge and messy

388
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,220
so uh out of the 21 tested differential

389
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,899
characteristics that we have we realize

390
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,160
that actually 10 of them are actually

391
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,279
impossible or single characteristics

392
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,199
and for the remaining differential

393
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:11,820
characteristics they actually only work

394
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,000
for a small key space

395
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,639
and for skinny 64 itself we can actually

396
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,320
plot the estimated theoretical

397
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,940
probability distribution

398
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,760
so this is one of the example in the

399
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,440
table itself is what we actually compute

400
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
and the graph actually shows what we

401
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,120
actually do experimentally so this is on

402
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,220
E variable currently about four rounds

403
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,560
of a particular characteristic so that

404
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,899
the probability actually stays in what

405
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,519
we can actually compute experimentally

406
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,620
so for skinny one to eight

407
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,079
um we tested about 22 differential

408
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,540
characteristics and 11 of them are

409
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,160
actually impossible

410
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,779
and once again the rest of the

411
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:55,980
differential characteristics also have

412
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,240
some sort of constraints on the key

413
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,480
space

414
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,399
and for this for most of them we

415
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,899
actually require an experimental

416
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,459
experimentally determine probability

417
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:06,839
distribution

418
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,459
so actually once you split into

419
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:09,779
different groups some of the groups are

420
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,699
small enough we still evaluated

421
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,680
theoretically but for the ones that are

422
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,360
too large we will use the experimental

423
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,600
approach

424
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,519
so we can actually do the same thing for

425
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,860
GIF itself but forgive because of the

426
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,959
interactions of the permutations uh for

427
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,339
the non-linear constraints we cannot

428
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,899
actually go for far too long

429
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,199
so for both versions of the skinny and

430
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,019
sorry GIF of the 15 tested differential

431
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,880
characteristics one of them is actually

432
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,040
impossible and for the one that we

433
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,139
actually tested for the The Impossible

434
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,820
case it's actually not due to a key

435
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,220
constraint because uh if you recall

436
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,079
forgive itself not all the big

437
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,000
permutations actually involve the key

438
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,040
bits some of them do not involve the key

439
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,199
bits so for this impossible case it

440
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,459
actually involves one that doesn't

441
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,320
really add in any key or wrong constants

442
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
which means that even if you change the

443
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,800
key or you change the wrong constant

444
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,659
this characteristic doesn't really work

445
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,099
so most of the remaining tested

446
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,480
differential characteristics also have

447
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,559
some key dependent constraints

448
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,959
okay so let's go back to the question at

449
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,520
the start which is that what we're

450
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,020
looking for is actually differentials

451
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,119
but for this book itself we actually

452
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,559
Focus mostly on differential

453
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,419
characteristics

454
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,400
so over here even though we show that a

455
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,380
differential characteristic is not valid

456
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,760
it doesn't really mean that the

457
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,380
differential or the boomerang or

458
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,480
rectangle is actually impossible so like

459
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,160
for some for most of the results that we

460
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,200
actually show just now most of them are

461
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,640
taken from like some boomerangs or

462
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,400
rectangle or like differential usage so

463
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,140
in those cases the results are still

464
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,539
valid are still validated provided they

465
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,520
actually do an experimental out so over

466
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,980
here what I want to do is to one when it

467
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,940
comes when it comes to like

468
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,340
theoretically compute Computing like the

469
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,400
like a key recovery attack it might have

470
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,620
some errors inside that

471
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,419
so one thing to note is that actually

472
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,880
the pro because because uh the one that

473
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,140
we're looking for is actually a dominant

474
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,480
characteristic which means that if it's

475
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,220
not working that means the probability

476
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,600
of dominant characteristic might may

477
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,240
change and this may also affect the

478
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,860
probability of differential as well

479
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,480
so we have done some experiments and to

480
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,460
look at like differential in in the in

481
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,020
the case of differentials whether they

482
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,580
are actually valid or not so we actually

483
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,620
tested two cases and just happens that

484
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,320
one of them actually works that means

485
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,700
there are some other characteristics

486
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,160
inside a differential that allows the

487
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,179
the inputs to to pass through but in in

488
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,820
the other case it also it also there's

489
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,200
also a possibility that actually there

490
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,240
are no valid keys that allow any of the

491
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,440
characteristics in the differential to

492
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,240
pass through so this is actually very

493
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,160
subjective to the wrong function how is

494
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,799
it being constructed and so as to a

495
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,780
certain extent how many trills are there

496
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,660
in the differential so of course uh if

497
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,919
you have more true sensor a differential

498
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,780
there are higher chances that one of

499
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,200
them will work

500
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,179
so lastly what we want to do is to

501
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,179
actually integrate with like automated

502
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,679
methods and everything so previously

503
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,559
most of the searches that overcome this

504
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,539
kind of issues they focus on finding a

505
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:16,500
right path directly for the uh to ensure

506
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,679
that the characteristic actually works

507
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,380
however this might not this this may

508
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,260
actually have a very high complexity in

509
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,340
terms of like the search space and

510
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,360
everything because they have to actually

511
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,760
consider actual values and everything

512
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,340
so over here what we are trying to do is

513
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,220
actually uh try to incorporate the

514
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,380
constraints that we actually found into

515
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,600
consume into into CP

516
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,280
so previously I talked about like the

517
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,360
linear constraints non-linear

518
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,559
constraints and the high order

519
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,020
constraints what we do is that we try to

520
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,160
incorporate the linear constraints

521
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,980
inside so to a certain extent it

522
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,600
um it helps to avoid most of the

523
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,820
incompatibilities that arise due to the

524
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,919
linear constraints but with some sort

525
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,020
ignore the rest for the time being

526
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,240
because we do not want to increase the

527
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,799
amount of like

528
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,840
um variables

529
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,640
in CP itself

530
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,520
so uh yes so what we do is that we

531
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,919
actually manage to so for one of the

532
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,299
impossible differential characteristics

533
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,460
that we found previously uh we put

534
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,980
inside the con the CP itself and we

535
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,059
input the constraints that uh allows

536
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,240
allows to change the

537
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,299
the parts they're having issues and what

538
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,520
we what we can what we eventually get is

539
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,440
a particular characteristic that

540
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,520
actually

541
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,500
is correct so what we do is that we

542
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,419
actually evaluate it experimentally and

543
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,520
it actually works

544
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,799
yeah so that's the end of my

545
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,179
presentation thank you for your

546
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,360
attention

547
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,240
thank you very much any question or

548
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,780
comment

549
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,580
yes

550
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,280
thank you very much for a talk uh so you

551
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,760
propose you find some constraints so

552
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,200
that to so uh in differential

553
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,900
applications but so the how to find this

554
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,900
constraints and so is it so sufficient

555
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,600
or something uh there is the

556
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,500
possibilities uh Overlook some so

557
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,220
overlock some constraint so is it uh so

558
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,580
actually so the we I think so that there

559
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,980
are many kinds of the constraints and

560
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,039
the non-linear linear and but many many

561
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:42,059
consonants the is it enough so the

562
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,340
okay so uh this is a problem that we

563
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,020
actually struggled with so we cannot

564
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,940
really guarantee that all the concerns

565
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,919
that we have found are the constraints

566
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,520
that we uh that that exists but uh so

567
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,140
what we did is that we look at all the

568
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,700
small characteristics and we actually

569
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,380
plot out experimentally as well as the

570
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,720
theoretical values so they actually

571
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,120
match so at least for small

572
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,280
characteristics we can say that most of

573
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,000
the

574
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,919
um most of the dependencies we actually

575
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,020
find out but for larger characteristics

576
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,100
that we cannot really test out

577
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,140
experimentally we cannot say for sure

578
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,460
okay thank you very much

579
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,480
thank you

580
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,980
are

581
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,020
over some

582
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,140
other questions here in the room

583
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,240
or maybe in Beijing

584
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,580
do you have any question or comments to

585
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,780
the speaker in Beijing

586
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,179
I think we do not have any question in

587
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:39,500
the chat no

588
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,919
yes

589
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,780
yes we can hear you yes

590
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,799
I noticed that there is a difference

591
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,980
between your theory and the and the your

592
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,559
random experience and and a little

593
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,860
curious about how how do you how you

594
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,780
look at some of this difference and uh

595
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,520
maybe

596
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,799
um yeah another word maybe your your

597
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,600
heart

598
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,940
I I want to know how how do you look at

599
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,659
it and the uh the reason although maybe

600
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,919
you can can you use plus the reason why

601
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,520
it's uh why it would be heaven

602
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,740
or can you get it

603
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,960
the question as far as I understand is

604
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,340
that there are some differences between

605
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,440
your fear is the theory that you

606
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,039
presented in Via experiments and how can

607
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,080
you uh explain that between the

608
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,440
difference with the experimental results

609
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,880
May I know which experiment are you

610
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,960
referring to

611
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,960
20.

612
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,700
the two picture the pictures under the

613
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,880
list

614
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,539
this one yes yes in your list there are

615
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,419
there are about tools

616
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:57,960
six values angle the corresponding

617
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,360
percentage but so you figure there are

618
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,039
some more

619
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:05,240
yes and some other values and the

620
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,799
probabilities I am a little curious

621
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:10,400
about this

622
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,780
you're asking okay

623
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,960
um in your list there are six values in

624
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,380
your property your property yes

625
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,919
yes and in your speech in the future you

626
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,179
ask them others

627
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,820
don't

628
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,200
do not flow into the list

629
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,960
ah

630
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,780
um actually there are only six values

631
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,760
inside there so you can as you can see

632
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,840
this is some sort of like because

633
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,580
experimentally there will be some sort

634
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,640
of like uh

635
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,200
uh probability we will spread throughout

636
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,179
so what we what we should be looking for

637
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,039
is the parts that are slightly

638
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,200
horizontal so what you should be

639
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,740
focusing is uh can you see my cursor

640
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,780
yes

641
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,880
oh you can see okay yeah so what I can

642
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,520
see is uh the ones over here this is the

643
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,780
second one

644
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,340
the Third

645
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,900
the fourth

646
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,980
Fifth and the sixth so the rest are due

647
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,419
to experimental errors and everything

648
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,159
but what we can see is that there is a

649
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,679
distribution over there that

650
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,580
um yeah

651
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:43,980
thank you

652
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,559
so I think we don't have any questions

653
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,159
to chat okay so I guess we'll stop here

654
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,860
so thank you thanks very much and let's

655
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,460
thanks the speakers of both speakers but

656
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,080
we have in the session thank you
