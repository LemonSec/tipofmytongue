1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
dedicated to the best papers that we

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,120
have in the conference and so the first

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,540
one of these best papers is

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,219
entitle hybrid code lifting on Space

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,420
hard block ciphers and it's a paper by

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,199
yosuke Todo and takanori izobe and Jose

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,779
is giving the talk

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,480
ah okay okay yeah thank you very much

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,119
for introduction so I'm Jose Todo head

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,939
from NDT social informatics Laboratories

11
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,098
I'd like to talk about hybrid code

12
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,160
drifting on space headbrooks

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,780
oh

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,559
yes wait

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,820
s yeah okay so and that this is the

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,159
generals so thank you very much for the

17
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,799
uh getting the best paper but on this

18
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,939
talk yeah okay so the topic is about

19
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,400
white box cryptography

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,340
uh so when we discussed something some

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,920
security on block Cipher so the usual

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,680
attack setting is a black box attack so

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,380
Black Box attacker can observe choose

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,600
print text and the corresponding Cipher

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,600
text and uh technical of course never

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,060
what's the inside of the encryption and

27
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,600
the goal is to whether they extract as

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,640
they become as a secret key or not

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,159
so on the other hand a white box

30
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,280
attacker is more stronger than Black Box

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,159
attacker so white box attacker can

32
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,320
observe everything including the inside

33
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,500
of the encryption so of course it is

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,560
very difficult to ensure some security

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,040
against such a powerful attackers but uh

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,520
industry so it's a very uh practically

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,960
so demanded because uh sometimes

38
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,818
encryption can be used on untrusted

39
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,060
environments then we want to ensure

40
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,640
something security against such powerful

41
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,900
attackers

42
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,940
so when we discuss self-whitebook

43
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,459
security on Brook Cipher so primary goal

44
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,040
is to register key extraction attack it

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,220
means that we have the uh we have we now

46
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,959
have the encryption program and the

47
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,660
white box attack ad cannot extract the

48
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,640
secret key from this program

49
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,520
so once we can ensure some security

50
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,680
against the Key Construction attack the

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,959
next secondary goal is to register code

52
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,340
listing

53
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,040
so the topic uh my talk is about space

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,340
Hard Rock Cipher so which is a kind of

55
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,700
the uh white box broke Cipher

56
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,860
and the space Hard Rock ciphers was

57
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,140
initially introduced by both nanohand

58
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,400
isoba at the htmcs 2015. and that this

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,739
structure is it going to

60
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,519
what Network

61
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,560
so this is a space uh specification of

62
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,959
the space uh that the one with the space

63
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,959
had broke Cipher so it is Target heavy

64
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,239
generalized space there and F function

65
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,640
is generated by secular block Cipher

66
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,879
such as AES with constraint print text

67
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,700
and the truncated ciphertext

68
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,000
so and the encryption is executed by

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,340
iterating these round functions

70
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,099
now we are now white box attacker so we

71
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,319
can observe everything so we can observe

72
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,440
the paper but of course it's a very

73
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,420
difficult to extract the secret key

74
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,340
because

75
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,920
uh it is almost equivalent with uh Black

76
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,959
Box attack against AES

77
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,480
so it's hard to extract the secret key

78
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,799
from the table

79
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,040
but so the main question is called

80
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,459
lifting so in this these papers into the

81
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,519
space hardness like this so m z space

82
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,220
hardness is defined the implementation

83
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,360
of Brock Cipher is MZ space hard if it

84
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,700
is invisible to encrypt any randomly

85
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,159
drum plain text with probability higher

86
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,500
than to the minus 3 giving any cause of

87
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,780
size less than M so it means that okay

88
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,339
so now we have the encryption program

89
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,060
and we can get some leakage so the white

90
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,259
box attacker leak m a blue entries but

91
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,840
attacker cannot copy the encryption

92
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,800
program

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,860
so when we create a leakage so we have

94
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,500
several attack models so one is a known

95
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,740
space it leaks M table entries randomly

96
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,960
and chosen space can choose the table

97
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,380
entry and adaptively chosen space can

98
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,100
uh choose adaptably choose table entries

99
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,259
now final one is arbitrary leakage is

100
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,139
the most utmost powerful so white box

101
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,780
attacker can generate leakage so there

102
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,780
and uh so not only the table entry but

103
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,960
also any leakage

104
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,040
okay so that's a question is so behind

105
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,720
the intention of the space hardness so

106
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,720
that all sales of space hardness uh say

107
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,940
like it is so that even if white books

108
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,040
that that guy can successfully extract

109
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,400
the M code from the implementation

110
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,680
attacker can't imitate the cipher so it

111
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,840
implies something leakage residential

112
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,720
Security even if our leakage is

113
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,900
generated by white box attacker but the

114
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,419
question is is uh whether this intention

115
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:31,560
to or not

116
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,820
so

117
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,460
actually space hardness doesn't suppose

118
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,320
the Black Box attack are receiving the

119
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,680
leakage so the after getting the leakage

120
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,720
and that's the attacker cannot create it

121
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,039
to the encryption wrapper in the space

122
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,160
hardness but if a slight leakage arrows

123
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,020
the Black Box attacker to recover the

124
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,539
full program it doesn't satisfy this

125
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,340
indication Maybe

126
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,160
so now we want to consider the more

127
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,320
advanced attack scenario so hybrid

128
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,220
scenario so now as a fast phase is uh

129
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,220
exactly the same of the code listing so

130
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,500
we can get some leakage from the

131
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,720
encryption program and then the second

132
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,900
page is a black box so Black Box attack

133
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,020
has a additional Advantage by using the

134
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,960
leakage and so the goal is to recover

135
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,900
the encryption program

136
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,220
so now uh we now want to revisit the

137
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,400
security existing space has block Cipher

138
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,340
uh using hybrid scenario and our Target

139
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,060
is a euro and SPN box so Euro it was a

140
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,960
proposed that Chess at 2021 and one of

141
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,759
the reasons why we want to focus on the

142
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,100
euro is a very unique functionality

143
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,840
called Longevity

144
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,380
and SPM box is as possible knows the

145
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,720
most efficient space have Cipher so I

146
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,979
want to try it

147
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,199
better of course those are not that

148
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,100
hybrid setting is out of the designer

149
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,639
security claim so now we say as a

150
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,800
something attack but it's out of the

151
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,160
scope of the uh existing uh existing

152
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,400
design

153
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,660
okay so now uh

154
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,020
so this is the specifications and the

155
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,639
euroi has three Xboxes S1 S2 S3 and so

156
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,979
the linear layer is a constant addition

157
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,979
and the multiplication of the MDS but a

158
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,380
very interesting one so the last key

159
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,599
bits uh applied to the linear layer but

160
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,259
the top and bits just identity map so we

161
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,900
don't touch anything in the linear layer

162
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,840
and finally aesa is upright

163
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,900
the security claim is 128-bit security

164
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,180
against black box and key extractions

165
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,300
and for space hardness to the end in

166
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,240
over for 128 space hardness against Case

167
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,300
a so it means that if we can get the

168
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,139
quota cable entries uh we cannot imitate

169
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,500
the code

170
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,660
okay so the unique property longevity so

171
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,479
that this is a very nice property of

172
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,580
Euro

173
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,099
was designed to aim for the unit this

174
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,479
property

175
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,840
so longevity is uh namely updatable

176
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,780
implementation so the functionality is

177
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,539
maintained it means now we have plain

178
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,879
text here and the encrypt and gets a

179
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,400
ciphertext and after that so that we

180
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,580
update the table then the original cyber

181
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,799
text is successfully decrypted to

182
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,740
original print text even after the table

183
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,159
is updated

184
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,500
so uh once the implementation is updated

185
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,800
so white box attacker needs to redeak

186
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,899
the updated table from the beginning to

187
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,320
copy the functionality so it can be

188
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,080
promising counter measure so against uh

189
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,959
this attack so we fast big slight data

190
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,660
every day so for example 10 megabytes

191
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,839
every day so after that in by spending

192
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,060
100 days so we can correct the one

193
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,399
gigabyte data so we can copy everything

194
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,519
so to counter this type of attack the

195
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,420
longevity is designed proposed

196
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,279
okay so that this is the structure of

197
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,600
the Euro e so and uh so to update uh

198
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,959
implementation so they use uh uh

199
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,700
identity map pack so they first prepares

200
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,120
mm bits secure block Cipher EK and the

201
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,899
upright is uh after the Xbox we apply EK

202
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,899
and this EK is totally canceled by

203
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,779
adding the DK so in the next round so

204
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,959
originally we use S1 S2 S3 is the

205
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:49,620
original Xbox but uh after updating T1

206
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,560
T2 T3 are used instead

207
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,899
so in the security grain so the two to

208
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,899
the ending over 64 128 space hard

209
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,720
against Case each table update it means

210
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,240
that now we have the implementation we

211
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,779
can get uh uh so one over 64 table

212
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,899
entries after updated one over 64

213
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,480
leakage

214
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,240
but we cannot imitate the encryption

215
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,420
program

216
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,060
okay so now we want to attack so our

217
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,160
idea is faster to introduce the

218
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,920
canonical representations and this

219
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,080
representation is quickly deconstructed

220
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,660
from the each implementation and we also

221
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,899
use the leakage Vedic the ASP and the

222
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,959
slide stable entries to as an attack to

223
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,480
be practical and finally we use a black

224
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,899
box attack uh using the trunk 82

225
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,120
Financial characteristics

226
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,519
okay so the first this is a canonical

227
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,640
representation so we first choose ER

228
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,740
such that still the TR satisfies

229
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,459
property one so this property one is F1

230
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,399
input of X we focus on the input of X

231
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,399
such that after applying it till the TR

232
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,980
uh last three bits are fixed for example

233
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,700
or zero then so we collect such uh

234
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,079
Twitter that uh due to the m a bit uh

235
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,800
two to the m entries and uh if x i is

236
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,920
less than x zero y i is less than y j so

237
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,920
satisfying these equations in quality so

238
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,140
we put uh ER

239
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,579
so such ER is easily constructed by

240
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,480
using biops for white box attackers uh

241
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,120
with practical time complexity

242
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,720
so after uh so the goal is to recover

243
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,839
this each till that you want to till the

244
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,959
TR

245
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,820
and the attack uh so in the Black Box

246
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,800
space we use that these are very nice

247
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,420
high probability trunk 82 Financial

248
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,060
characteristics so it's a probability is

249
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,459
very high so it's very easy to detect

250
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,079
this drunkage differential

251
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,899
characteristics by Black Box attack and

252
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,660
finally uh League constructs all table

253
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,839
entries or the canonical representation

254
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,440
so this is how many of results

255
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,519
uh so for Euro is 60 so we use 800 bit

256
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,480
leakage so the original encryption

257
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,420
program is very big so the radio is a

258
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,860
two to the minus about 12 uh so very

259
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,260
small data is enough to recover the full

260
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,500
program uh in hybrid setting and there's

261
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,980
a black box and attack phase complexity

262
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,779
three it's a practical

263
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:41,519
so but in SPN box so if it in that case

264
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,779
there is no significant availability

265
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:48,959
such as Leica euroi so but impossible to

266
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,480
maintain 128 with security in the hybrid

267
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,560
setting

268
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,600
okay so the finally so that I want to

269
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,579
talk attack against longevity so it's a

270
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:59,220
not so story about the hybrid setting

271
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,339
so motivation is a hybrid attack doesn't

272
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,980
break the whole security claim so now I

273
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,240
want to break the whole sensitivity

274
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,680
frame okay so this answer focus is about

275
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,260
longevity so the attack setting is like

276
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,600
this so the V has have the inclusion

277
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,180
program and I get leakage and update

278
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,980
table and the leakage update table

279
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,899
leakage and that will be correct all

280
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,839
leakage and the recovery encryption

281
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:26,180
program

282
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,980
so but their family generates a leakage

283
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,200
so that we have several attack models

284
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,639
one is arbitrary education

285
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,339
memory or something but uh so if we

286
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,680
allow arbitrary leakage we can always

287
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,860
attack it so the interesting one is a

288
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,959
case a leakage that is also a security

289
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,420
grade so case a leakage means that we

290
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,579
cannot attacker cannot choose the table

291
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,519
enter it just a randomly chosen every

292
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,320
entries are leaked

293
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,700
so

294
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,980
the idea is again harmonical

295
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,360
representation

296
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,880
so now we want to try to recover till

297
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,420
the T1 so what we do is we first get the

298
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,740
league table entry of t1t as a leakage

299
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,600
and uh so canonical representation is

300
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,120
independent of e1t so it's not difficult

301
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,279
to recommend T1 Tilda

302
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,519
then after recovers uh T1 children so we

303
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,240
next try to read about 3.2 so but we

304
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,680
again gets uh t1t table entries as a

305
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,959
leakage so it means that we can get the

306
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,360
partially partial table entries of the

307
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,019
e1t then d1t is the decryption so we can

308
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,899
yes partial

309
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:42,959
uh table entries of d1t and the t3p also

310
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,600
the leakage so in total so we get a

311
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,940
partial favorite entries of the d1t and

312
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,519
a composition of the T to T and the t1t

313
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,699
so again so that we uh e to T is

314
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,100
independent of the tilde T2 and we can

315
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,899
construct that we can decoupage the

316
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,220
theore that T2

317
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,180
so by repeating this attack procedures

318
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,120
uh iteratively we can recover all of the

319
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,040
table entries

320
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,579
so this is a summary so in euro is 60

321
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,839
uh if we you spend the

322
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,240
248.78 time complexity we can break the

323
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,399
we can recover as a full program and

324
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,600
that this is a breakup of the security

325
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,860
grain

326
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,920
okay so that I concluded my talk so that

327
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,019
we propose a hybrid called lifting and

328
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,240
demonstrates the impact and break the

329
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,820
security Claim about the longevity and

330
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,440
the counter measure is very interesting

331
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,620
open question so actually the increasing

332
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,120
number of round is one idea but uh so it

333
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,940
maybe so if as a leakage it's only

334
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,180
limited to KSA leakage it's a useful but

335
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,699
it's difficult to ensure the security on

336
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,519
not only arbitrary but also as a leakage

337
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,279
adaptability chosen space leakage so the

338
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,320
I think the open question is how to

339
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,079
design an upgradable space at Cipher

340
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,139
ensuring security guest after ID leakage

341
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:07,459
okay so thank you very much

342
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,620
thank you

343
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,779
are there some comments or questions

344
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:22,939
first here in the room in Kobe

345
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,779
does anyone have a question to yusuke

346
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,139
yes

347
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,540
okay so is there existence of the

348
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,100
canonical representation has been

349
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,720
already mentioned in the original paper

350
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,839
or you it's a it's a new property you

351
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,019
just found a new property a new property

352
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,800
yeah thank you

353
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,800
any other questions or comment here

354
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,779
okay I don't know if there are some

355
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,480
questions in Beijing

356
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,540
sorry uh Dear Professor thanks for

357
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,020
excellent attack on urea I have three

358
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,819
questions and follows in my

359
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,280
understanding your attack is you can

360
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,339
divide data into two-phase flame laser

361
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,500
white box phase and

362
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,939
the Black Box face and my question is in

363
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,179
the first phase of your attack it is

364
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,880
based on unlimited Force to read or

365
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,059
compute the information of the teapots

366
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:30,840
uh the question of mind is yes it is a

367
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,820
physical

368
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,520
to manufacture such as powerful tools in

369
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,840
the real world

370
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,080
and the second one is that

371
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,059
um

372
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,520
oh the company because it's a data

373
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,860
complexity as which phase is more

374
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,380
important than your opinions the white

375
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,620
box phase all the Black Box fix

376
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,039
and this and the third question is based

377
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,280
on the space hardness suffers

378
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,100
so in your openings

379
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:06,260
weather is practical in the real rewards

380
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,520
for the

381
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,080
space hardness type

382
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,440
we should say it's a bit difficult to

383
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,160
answer many questions I think so like

384
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,679
can we it's it's this

385
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,160
yeah

386
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,600
sorry sorry

387
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,960
um sorry it's yeah it's quite difficult

388
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,880
for for us to understand your question

389
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,539
could we could you just say uh the first

390
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,940
question in a few words so that we can

391
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,679
get it

392
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,520
okay my first question is that uh in

393
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,760
your white box phase uh you are based on

394
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,580
uh unlimited Force to read or compute

395
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,059
the informations of the Tee Box and

396
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,400
um if it's feasible to manufacturers

397
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,520
that's a such a powerful force in the

398
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,000
reality

399
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,059
so I'm I'm not sure that I perfectly

400
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,100
understand your question or not but uh

401
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,280
so in my settings so in the white box

402
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,120
setting white box attack card uh

403
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,700
so has a timer complexity of the white

404
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,160
box attack is bounded

405
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,940
so it means that so now uh

406
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,059
I mean industry are the impacted so but

407
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,600
uh as a just a theory so the white box

408
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,100
attack can access all table entries and

409
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,700
they can watch everything and but uh

410
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,039
complexity of the attack algorithm is

411
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,620
bounded so of course if it's not bounded

412
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,419
so the attacker can guess everything and

413
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,340
that extracts the original secret key

414
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,160
but uh it's a not uh it's a prohibited

415
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,220
because the time complexity is about it

416
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,799
okay thank you

417
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,960
thank you we have one question in the

418
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,000
chat the question is instead of the code

419
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,880
lifting attack how space hard ciphers

420
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,900
can resist the direct inversion attack

421
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,020
sorry I'm not so sure as a direct

422
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,940
inversion attack so

423
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,299
maybe yes so

424
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:23,039
sorry to say I don't know that I like to

425
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,080
impression attack so I can't enter it

426
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,799
sorry

427
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,320
however maybe we have time for one short

428
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,380
question maybe from Beijing or or in the

429
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,620
chat

430
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,799
okay if not let's Banks the speakers so

431
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,639
thank you yosuke

432
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,240
thank you
