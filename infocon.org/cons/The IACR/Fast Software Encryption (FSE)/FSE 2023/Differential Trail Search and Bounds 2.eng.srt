1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
this section has two presentations

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,600
the first presentation is about the

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,480
paper entitled towards tight

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,240
differential bands of ascom a hybrid

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,719
usage of smt and MRP

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,259
the authors are logiconym and

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,600
the speaker is black vendora

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,699
please start your presentation oh thank

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,039
you very much for the introduction my

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,199
name is raghavendra Rohit and today I

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,000
will speak about towards tight

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,640
differential bonds of ascon hybrid usage

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,579
of smt and Bill this is a joint work

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,440
with my colleague Rusty

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,440
okay so let me start uh with a brief

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,200
overview of ascon

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,300
so ascon is a family of authenticated

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,000
encryption and hashing algorithms it was

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,420
designed by Adobe and others in 2014.

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,000
and both the authenticated encryption

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,699
and hessing they are based on the sponge

22
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,880
mode of operation and the core

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,420
permutation ascon so here I denote it by

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,380
B

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,740
so it operates on a state of size 320

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,380
bits and based on the functionality the

27
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,119
number of rounds are different so for

28
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,900
example for AED uh it's either 6 8 or 12

29
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,380
but for has all the time 12 runs are

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,560
used

31
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,259
so uh s con uh was selected as a primary

32
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,700
choice for lightweight authenticated

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,280
encryption in the final part

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,040
portfolio of the Cesar competition and

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,040
very recently uh it was announced as a

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,360
new standard for lightweight

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,520
cryptography in the nist lightweight

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,119
crypto competition

39
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,240
so uh our goal is our goal here is to

40
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,820
investigate the uh tight bonds for the

41
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,439
differential and linear properties of

42
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,340
ascon are reduced to R rounds

43
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,920
so uh let's see uh how the round

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,600
function looks like

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,479
so we have a state uh which is arranged

46
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,380
into five rows and 64 columns

47
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,180
and so the first step is around constant

48
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,720
addition where in row second row X2 uh

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,580
eight bit constraint is added to the

50
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,760
last eight second significant bits of

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,280
the state then we have the ask box layer

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,459
where 5 bit s box is applied parallel to

53
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,280
all 64 columns and then we have the

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,459
linear layer PL where the rows are mixed

55
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,060
among themselves

56
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,700
okay so now uh if we looked into the s

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,239
box uh so it's a quadratic permutation

58
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,420
and it's a fine equivalent to uh five

59
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,640
bit Chi the S Works which is used in

60
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,959
kitchen

61
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,140
and the linear layer usually uh mixes

62
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,660
the bits within our rows so for example

63
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,700
if we take a

64
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,280
the first row uh y 0

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,160
uh it creates uh another two copies of

66
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,060
y0 with shift offsets 19 and 28 and then

67
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,519
you X are all these three rows to get

68
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,819
the output value x0 we do the same thing

69
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,940
for other four rows but the shift

70
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,079
offsets are changed

71
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,500
and now if we look into the s box uh and

72
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,060
linear layer or the differential and

73
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,060
linear properties so the differential

74
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,940
distribution table of s box uh this is

75
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,300
entries two four and eight so that means

76
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,819
the differential probabilities are 2 to

77
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,620
the power minus 4 2 to the power minus 3

78
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,599
and 2 to the power minus two so this is

79
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,940
the uh maximum differential uh

80
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,620
uniformity

81
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,959
and same way in the linear approximation

82
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,799
table we have these entries and the

83
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,080
maximum bias in terms of magnitude is 2

84
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,940
to the power minus 2.

85
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,420
and if we look into the linear layer so

86
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,519
both the differential and linear branch

87
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,560
number of the linear layer is equals

88
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,900
four so this we can see directly from

89
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,879
the uh

90
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,700
expression of the linear layer which is

91
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,599
here

92
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,340
so we can see from here the differential

93
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,200
and linear branch number both are four

94
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,040
okay so now uh here I will discuss uh

95
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,919
the state of the art uh differential and

96
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,600
linear Bonds on the S count permutation

97
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,639
and I will also discuss uh the

98
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,759
contribution of this work

99
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,820
okay so uh when initially s con was

100
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,800
submitted to the Caesar competition in

101
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,699
14 2014 the designers uh gave a four

102
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,400
round differential drill uh with 47

103
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,860
active Xboxes

104
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,199
so in the next year in their updated

105
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,320
version this was uh improved to

106
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,840
44 active s boxes

107
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,479
until then there was no progress on

108
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,759
either improving the upper bound or

109
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,320
lower bound on the number of active s

110
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,580
boxes

111
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,600
and in last year FSE uh airlocker and

112
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,840
authors they have shown that uh any four

113
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,660
round differential Trail must have at

114
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,360
least 36 active Xboxes but this was not

115
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,979
tight

116
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,860
and there was no uh result on whether

117
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,040
this bound on 44 activist box is tight

118
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,020
or not

119
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,259
so in this work uh actually we find a

120
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,080
differential drill with 43 active Xboxes

121
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,440
so right now currently the

122
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,680
Bound for four rounds is between 36 and

123
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,160
42 and this we don't know

124
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,280
now if we look into five rounds the best

125
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,800
node differential Trail has 78 active

126
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,720
Xboxes and this was again given by the

127
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,340
designers

128
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,560
and here in this work

129
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,340
we found a trail with 72 active s boxes

130
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,500
uh in addition to that uh

131
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,900
we found uh many differential drills

132
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,539
with 44 actives boxes or four rounds and

133
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,240
also some Trails for with 72 active s

134
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,900
boxes so then we looked whether we could

135
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,419
improve the best node uh differential

136
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,180
probability for four rounds so

137
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,160
so the West node has a differential

138
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,300
probability

139
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,340
so this is differential probability not

140
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,120
the differential so it has gate 107 and

141
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,460
weight 190 for four and five rounds so

142
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,440
we checked all the trails we found for

143
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,259
44 and 72 active s boxes but

144
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,660
unfortunately we could not improve the

145
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,660
uh probability

146
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,660
however uh but for three rounds we

147
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,759
proved that uh if we take any three

148
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,520
round differential drill then it weight

149
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,580
is at least 40 so this we proved with a

150
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,000
build and smt and

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,280
this was also proved independently in

152
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,780
AME 2022 but this was this set

153
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,380
okay now uh if we look into the bonds on

154
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,240
the Square correlation

155
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,360
so for four rounds uh the best known

156
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,520
Trail has scored correlation to the

157
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,940
power minus 98

158
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,300
and again uh this is still the best

159
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,319
known bound

160
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,259
and last year uh this was grouped to be

161
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,500
2 to the power minus 72. and it's still

162
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,720
not tight

163
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,660
and when we look into five rounds uh the

164
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,120
best node has it's quite correlation 2

165
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,639
to the power minus 186

166
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,919
and again uh

167
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,680
this was the lower bound which is not

168
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,500
tied to the power minus 74 and here uh

169
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,440
we find a trail for five rounds which

170
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,880
improved this quite correlation by

171
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,199
factor of 2 to power minus two

172
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,400
and the trail which we found for five

173
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,819
rounds has 78 active s boxes

174
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,400
while the one uh which was the previous

175
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,259
uh which is quite correlation 2 to the

176
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,500
power minus 186 this is 67 activist

177
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,440
boxes so there is a difference of 11

178
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,520
active s boxes but not big Improvement

179
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,319
in terms of correlation values

180
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,139
also we try to check if we could improve

181
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,440
the correlation for four rounds by

182
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,199
looking at all uh 43 active s boxes but

183
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,979
we could not improve the best node bound

184
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,860
and we proved that uh if we take any

185
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,020
three round linear Trail then there is

186
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,478
no drill with 14 active s boxes

187
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,039
okay so uh these are some of our results

188
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,679
but now let's look how we obtain these

189
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,799
numbers

190
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,380
okay so uh our very basic idea is like

191
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,720
we have seen lot of automated tools and

192
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,000
all of them have like their own

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,399
advantages and disadvantages for example

194
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,620
if we are considering the milk then they

195
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,660
are very good in solving optimization

196
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,300
problem and set and smts are good for

197
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,160
satisfiability problems

198
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,839
add

199
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,380
so and if you see most of the works they

200
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,540
have analyzed the ciphers using these

201
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,540
tools in an independent way and they are

202
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,300
accelerating all these tools

203
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,480
and the one of the biggest problem here

204
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,940
is if we scale these tools let's say if

205
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,320
we are looking for Rounds then five

206
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,240
rounds or six rounds then the run time

207
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,459
we cannot predict so this is one of the

208
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,480
problem

209
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,420
so our approach here is why not use

210
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,519
these tools in a hybrid manner so that

211
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,740
means uh let's say for small number of

212
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,200
rounds we use smt we obtain the results

213
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,740
and then use those results as a input to

214
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,140
the MILF solver

215
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,860
so

216
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,200
okay so the all the smt and built models

217
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,420
they are available in our paper as well

218
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,420
as in our git repo so I will not discuss

219
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,000
them but at a very high level uh I will

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,700
discuss uh the approach

221
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,459
okay so what we did we started with uh

222
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,380
two round trails

223
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,000
so

224
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,120
here I so whenever I say di that means

225
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,060
uh the number of active s boxes at I

226
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,600
thrown is di so first we find all valid

227
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,760
pairs d0 and D1 for which results in a

228
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,500
differential trail with d0 active s

229
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,260
boxes and D1 active as boxes at Round 0

230
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,740
and 1. so we find all these valid pairs

231
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,800
so for example if I have one three that

232
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,200
means this pair is valid

233
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,080
and if we have uh this pair like 3 and 4

234
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,600
this will never give me a possible

235
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,700
differential trade so this is invalid

236
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,180
similarly we have 10 3 16 3 and 18 3.

237
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,700
and when we enumerate all these valid

238
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,360
pairs or invalid pairs we can do in

239
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,600
seconds using smt

240
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,660
okay uh in the next step

241
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,820
we exchange from two rounds to three

242
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,720
rounds

243
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,420
so the first thing here is we pre-filter

244
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,120
some candidates using two round invalid

245
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,540
differential uh pairs so for example uh

246
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,060
if we are looking for a three round

247
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,160
differential drill with 15 active Xboxes

248
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,200
then one of the possible choices could

249
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,200
be 3 4 and 8 but uh if we see here uh

250
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,380
3 4 is invalid so that means three four

251
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,300
eight we don't need to give it two set

252
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,040
or smt we can directly filter it

253
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,480
so first we pre-filter some candidates

254
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,339
uh you see two round differential trails

255
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:33,660
and then

256
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,959
you find all valid uh d0 D1 D2

257
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,579
for which there is a valid differential

258
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,560
Trail so if you see the numbers here

259
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,980
from for 15 active s boxes we only found

260
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,200
one possible Choice which is starting

261
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,620
from one three and then 11. for 16 there

262
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,860
are two so we completed this list up to

263
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,959
22 active Xboxes

264
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,959
so these are the uh results at the end

265
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,440
but how many cases we checked till 22.

266
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,380
so this uh table gives uh that many

267
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,500
cases so if we look into 15 active s

268
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,640
boxes

269
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,399
then after pre-filtering using two round

270
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,279
rails we have 37 cases

271
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,560
and when we solve them we only found one

272
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,440
which was one three eleven

273
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,440
or 16 there are 47 cases we have to

274
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,899
check and out of 47 there is there are

275
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,000
only two possible choices

276
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,300
so in the same way we completed this up

277
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,600
to 22 active s boxes but for 23

278
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,120
if you see there are total 133 cases to

279
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,899
check

280
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,140
and we find that 35 results in a very

281
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,459
valid Trail

282
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:45,060
and some most of them are invalid and

283
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,800
these are the cases

284
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,240
for which we could not find the

285
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,779
solutions so only 21 are left so

286
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,480
so we have this uh numbers till 32

287
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,820
active Xboxes so one of the problem we

288
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,740
faced here is for

289
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,320
uh some of the instances we could solve

290
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,079
them in 15 to 20 minutes but for some of

291
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,779
them it took more than hour

292
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,480
okay so now we use this to prove how we

293
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,760
can use this to prove uh the bound on

294
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,019
the weight of three on differential

295
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,320
Trails so we listed all the choices till

296
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,399
20 actives boxes and we use these

297
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,279
choices so for example we set one active

298
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,040
s boxes in round zero three in round one

299
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,920
eleven round two and then we minimize

300
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,620
the weight using milk and in seconds we

301
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,320
find that this weight is 40. similarly

302
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,620
we do for all the other choices and

303
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,600
OT is the minimum here so this means

304
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,160
that any three round differential Trail

305
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,339
has weight 40 in fact this is the only

306
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:48,120
choice which gives weight 40.

307
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,300
okay so now let's look into uh the four

308
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,839
round rails so similar to two round uh

309
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,420
similarly to when we moved from two to

310
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,639
three rounds we go from three to four

311
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,040
rounds while first pre-filtering some

312
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,459
candidates which are invalid so after

313
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,560
pre-filtering we have around like 72 000

314
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,480
cases

315
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,639
next what we do we have all the valid

316
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,639
pairs for up to 22 active Xboxes and

317
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,420
some valid pairs from 23 to 32 active s

318
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,660
boxes so we extend all those valid pairs

319
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,720
in forward and backward directions

320
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,700
so there are a lot of constants we found

321
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,180
so for them I suggest to see lemmas one

322
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,160
to four in our paper but what happened

323
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,740
when we were extending these Trails we

324
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,240
found a differential trail with 43

325
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,120
activist boxes at this point and this

326
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,800
directly reduce the number of candidates

327
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,899
from 72 000 to

328
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,440
around 11 000 and the overall run time

329
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,980
to get these numbers around 8 CPU days

330
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,220
this is on single quote

331
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,519
so now if we apply the results from so

332
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,019
this we did not know when we submitted

333
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,240
this work uh this results so now if we

334
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,399
apply this results from by air locker

335
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,399
and others then there are 36 active

336
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,100
Xboxes so if you use this then this will

337
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,540
reduce from 11 000 to 9793 candidates so

338
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,420
that means if we somehow solve this many

339
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,940
cases then we will know the exact

340
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,620
minimum number of active s boxes for

341
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,120
four rounds

342
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,279
so now this this may seem a bit small

343
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,440
but

344
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,720
the problem is uh

345
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,459
most of them

346
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,279
returns false within 2 to 20 minutes but

347
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,880
they are some candidates for them for it

348
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,040
may take hours or we don't even know the

349
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,160
time so this is a big problem so how we

350
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,459
can reduce these cases a bit further

351
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:48,779
so uh one of the approach we tried

352
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,560
so when we looked into these cases

353
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,180
uh we find that there are nine five four

354
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,779
cases where there are five active Xboxes

355
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,180
at Round zero

356
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,760
so either we can give all these cases to

357
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,800
smt or milk and solve them individually

358
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,639
or what we can do we can consider all

359
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,639
necklaces with weight 5 at Round zero

360
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,100
and check what is the how much time it's

361
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,620
taking to solve them so we uh checked

362
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,139
around 105 necklaces and for each of

363
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,680
them the average time to solve those uh

364
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,680
cases was around 2.5 minutes so we can

365
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,440
give uh the time to solve all these

366
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,120
cases

367
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,339
another uh approach would be when again

368
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,040
instead of looking d0 equals file we can

369
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,240
consider D1 equals five and in this case

370
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,440
there are 504 choices so then we solve

371
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,139
all these necklaces in around five days

372
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,820
but we could not find any four round

373
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,500
Trail of the form uh d0 five D two D3 so

374
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,259
this means uh we can

375
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,420
these all these five zero cases are

376
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,100
invisible

377
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,099
so right now the number of cases are

378
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,520
nine two eight nine

379
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,559
okay so again I want to stress here it's

380
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,619
very difficult to predict the time to

381
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:16,859
find the exact bound but maybe we can

382
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:21,419
look into these cases more in a more uh

383
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,939
clever way and find like some good

384
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:26,040
estimates on the time for example we can

385
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,600
look into D1 equal to 6 as well and

386
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,220
enumerate all those necklaces

387
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,559
okay so uh this is the similar approach

388
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,380
for uh five round uh differential and

389
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,840
linear trails and we found so this is a

390
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,840
trail with 72 active s boxes so these

391
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,220
are the

392
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,679
configuration of the S boxes in each

393
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,400
round

394
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,160
and the five round linear Trail we found

395
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,640
is this one with 78 active s boxes and

396
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,500
correlation 92 so that means quite

397
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,520
correlation 184

398
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,220
sorry one minute yeah

399
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,320
okay so uh to conclude the talk

400
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,900
so uh we improved the differential

401
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,419
linear amounts of ascon so by improving

402
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,059
basically I mean we improve the upper

403
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,780
bounds not the lower bounds and so this

404
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,000
is with using milk and smt in a hybrid

405
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,240
manner and finding exact differential

406
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,919
and linear mods for four rounds still

407
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,740
challenging and one of the approach we

408
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,440
maybe one could explore is till now we

409
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,840
have all the choices till 22 active

410
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,299
Xboxes so if we can enumerate all the

411
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,580
possible cases for till 30 active s

412
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,500
boxes then we can reduce the number of

413
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,059
cases significantly

414
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,299
and we can also apply this hybrid

415
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,400
approach to other Cycles thank you very

416
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,580
much

417
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:53,299
thank you for your presentation

418
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,419
do you have any questions

419
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:59,780
in Kobe

420
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,419
the thing

421
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,240
in Beijing do you have any question or

422
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,480
comment

423
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,299
question

424
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:15,059
hello thanks for your talk uh I have a

425
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,820
question uh can this method be modified

426
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,900
to get tighter lower bounds

427
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,340
uh lower ones we did not try uh but I

428
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,860
think it's uh if we can solve all these

429
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,200
cases then we can directly improve all

430
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,299
the lower bounds

431
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,760
okay thank you

432
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,919
yeah but maybe you will see in that next

433
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,880
talk or different approach

434
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,360
do you have any other questions document

435
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,899
online

436
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,539
thing

437
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:54,000
okay this presentation is now close

438
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,160
thank you thank you very much speak

439
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,400
again

440
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,919
okay let's move on to the next

441
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,840
presentation

442
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,660
the next present presentation is about

443
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,320
the paper entitled improved differential

444
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,340
and lineatory bonds or ask them

445
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,360
the authors are Solano and his serial

446
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,039
mellow

447
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,460
Rizal method and your diamond

448
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,160
the speaker is running

449
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,919
okay please start your presentation

450
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,980
thank you for the introduction

451
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,660
and I will present a work on improved

452
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,580
differential and linear actual bond for

453
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,740
us home

454
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,020
that I did with Sylvia Miller

455
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:56,240
this is an overview of the presentation

456
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,980
the goal of this work is to propose

457
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,840
technique that explores the structure of

458
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,539
the permutation using ascon to improve

459
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,820
the Bound for differential and initials

460
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,980
and in this presentation we're only

461
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,900
going to focus on differential Crypt

462
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,120
analysis

463
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,220
let's start with some basic notion on

464
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,500
differential trails

465
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,039
so for round function P we Define the

466
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,559
air 112 as a sequence of one

467
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,820
differential

468
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,760
we Define the GPU of 12 as a fraction of

469
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,100
old input pair with the input difference

470
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,860
a0 that exhibit all intermediate

471
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,179
differences

472
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:37,080
we can approximate the DP of 12 by the

473
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,299
product of the DP of the Run

474
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,240
differential of its one differentials

475
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,120
we said that a i and a i plus 1 are

476
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,700
compatible of other one function if the

477
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,280
DP of the one differential is bigger

478
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,960
than 0.

479
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,840
we Define the weight of a 12 as the sum

480
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,760
of the air weights of the wrong

481
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,340
differentials where the weight of a run

482
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,280
differential is equal to the minus log 2

483
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,379
of the DP of the one differential

484
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,640
let's have a look at the permutation

485
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,100
using ascon ascon p

486
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,360
so it operates under 320 bit state with

487
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,900
5 volt and 64 columns so transformation

488
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,720
as three-step a constant addition a

489
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,320
substitution layer and a linear layer

490
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,260
in particular for the nonlinear layer we

491
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,840
choose the s-box of keychak and before

492
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,360
and after there is a mixing step with

493
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,760
three bitwise addition

494
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,280
for the mixing layer it use a linear

495
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,039
function and dependently on each row and

496
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,400
for example for row 0 as a bit at

497
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,159
position I at the input will impact 3

498
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,580
bit at the output at position I I minus

499
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:57,320
19 modulo 64 and I minus 28 module 64.

500
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,059
going back to differential Trail we can

501
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,679
rephrase the wrong function by first

502
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,539
having the linear layer and then the

503
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,820
non-linear layer since it does not

504
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,200
impact the bound

505
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,120
and we include the differences between

506
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,340
the linear layer and the nonlinear layer

507
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,740
in our virtual notation

508
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,120
we obtain bi by applying PL to AI and

509
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,940
since PL is linear the DPL of a

510
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,039
differential over the linear layer is

511
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,140
equal to one so the weight of this

512
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,900
differential is equal to zero

513
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,600
therefore the weight of a 12 is the sum

514
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,820
of the air weights of the differential

515
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,740
over the non-linear layer

516
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,740
since the Xbox is based on the Xbox of

517
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,140
Kit check we have that non-linear layer

518
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,000
as algebraic2

519
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,159
to the weight of a differential over the

520
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,679
non-linear layer only depends on the

521
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,080
input at the non-linear layer

522
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,080
so for an input difference B the space

523
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,140
of compatible differences a form enough

524
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,120
and space and the dimension of this

525
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,120
space is the weight

526
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,659
given a trial we can extend it by 1 1 in

527
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,700
the forward direction we will all trial

528
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,179
by by appending to differential BR minus

529
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,820
1 a r and all 12 share the same

530
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,159
differences except AR

531
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,280
and have the same width however we don't

532
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,900
need to build them all to know their

533
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,340
weight

534
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,620
in the backward direction we build all

535
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,500
trials by prepending the differential a0

536
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,780
will be zero and they share the same

537
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,000
differences except the differential a0

538
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,440
will be zero and they don't have the

539
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,080
same weight but we can easily lower

540
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,360
boundary weight but to do that we don't

541
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,320
need to build them all

542
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,100
given A1 there are several differences

543
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,500
b0

544
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,120
adjustable differences below that are

545
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,700
compatible with A1 through the inverse

546
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,799
of the nonlinear layer

547
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,320
the minimum weight over this compatible

548
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,780
differences b0 is called the minimum

549
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,260
reverse weight of A1

550
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,320
it follows the two sequence from A1 to b

551
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,080
r minus one Define a set of twelves

552
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,539
called TriCore that share the same

553
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:14,640
intermediate differences and whose

554
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,500
weight can be lower Bound by the minimum

555
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,440
reverse weight of A1 Plus the sum of the

556
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,640
weight from B1 to be R minus 1.

557
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,220
let's see how we scan the space of 12 in

558
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,620
the permutation

559
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,960
so we follow the third search strategy

560
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,240
of ski check where we restrict the

561
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,480
search to try cause instead of 12 and we

562
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,679
will want a cause below Target to a TR

563
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,960
and if we found one or more Trails then

564
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,240
the minimum weight among them Define the

565
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,820
time bound on the weight of all A1

566
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,840
trials

567
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,900
otherwise TR is a bound on the weight of

568
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,840
all Airline trails so what we do is we

569
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,580
start from shutter to the course and

570
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,860
then extend

571
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,260
so for example if we want to generate

572
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,659
all four one's records or for it at most

573
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:06,539
80 then we know that any of those

574
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,419
hormones were caused as one of the two

575
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:12,720
two runs varicose that compose it avoid

576
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,299
Atmos 40.

577
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:18,659
therefore any poor launch Vehicles avoid

578
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:21,240
at most 80 can be generated by first

579
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,220
building all two runs vehicles with

580
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,620
weight at most 40 and then extend into

581
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,480
forward and backward Direction by two

582
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,580
round

583
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,640
similarly any eight rounds vehicle of

584
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,880
weight at most 160 can be generated by

585
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,100
first building all 413 cores with weight

586
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,620
at most 80 and then extend the forward

587
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,600
and backward duration by four ones

588
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,000
like I said we start from shotota and we

589
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,679
generate all to run through a course

590
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,340
using the tree base outbrush of kittrack

591
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,039
we have a two-dimensional space so we

592
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:59,640
adopted two level trees and since PS and

593
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,039
pl are invariant with respect to

594
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,220
translation along the horizontal axis we

595
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,500
can divide our state space

596
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,440
into equivalent classes or states in an

597
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,240
equivalent class of the same properties

598
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,799
and the same weight

599
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,440
so it's sufficient to generate one state

600
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,799
of a class and it's called canonical

601
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,620
so here for example you have three state

602
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,200
data equivalent modular horizontal shift

603
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,620
and we Define as canonical the one that

604
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,860
has its first active bit at position at

605
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,500
the smallest index position and for us

606
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,919
by convention and x0 is at the left so

607
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,620
in this example the canonical state is

608
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,380
the one on the left

609
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,960
we use a score function to prune our

610
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,059
tree and we use an alternative

611
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,520
representation of the linear layer to

612
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,900
make our last core function more

613
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,440
efficient

614
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,220
so here for example we have another

615
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,340
industry so we have a state a and we

616
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,500
always compute its corresponding B State

617
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,200
through the linear layer

618
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,380
then we look for a child of the state a

619
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,440
by always trying to add the new active

620
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,299
row that has its uh that has its first

621
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,500
attribute

622
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,059
uh

623
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,100
at position zero

624
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,320
if it's a valid State then we compute

625
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,840
its corresponding bit state

626
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,659
if we cannot add any more active rows we

627
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:30,480
will iterate on the last archival so we

628
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,400
look for the child of the last active

629
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,640
row by always trying to add a new it bit

630
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,340
after the last bit position

631
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,740
if it's a valid State again we compute

632
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,799
its corresponding B state

633
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,900
when we have no more chart for the last

634
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,600
active row we will look for The Sibling

635
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,940
of The Last Action table so here for

636
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,380
example we have a sibling of the State

637
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,200
of the State at the top so a sibling is

638
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,880
just moving the last active beat

639
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,059
position to the right position

640
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,400
if it's a valid State again we call

641
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,400
compute its corresponding B state

642
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,559
and then we look for a child called in

643
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,960
the last actionable Again by adding a

644
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,120
new active bit after the last activated

645
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,360
condition

646
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,679
to print our three we use a score

647
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,539
function that will lower Bond on the

648
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:24,179
weight of a node and all this descendant

649
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,220
we have that the non-linear layer is

650
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,860
applied in parallel on five bit colon

651
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,039
and adding a bit at an active colon at a

652
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,559
or at B cannot make it passive

653
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,200
and since each active colon contribute

654
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,360
at least two to the weight we can base

655
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,279
our score function on the number of

656
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,220
active columns at a and at B

657
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,120
however at B this is sub-optimal but

658
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,740
because of the way we contribute our

659
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,559
state at a we know that bit in all

660
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,899
active rows but the last one will always

661
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,539
remain active so we can consider the

662
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:59,760
contribution to the weight and for that

663
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,279
we Define a lower bound and the weight

664
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,679
of a colon and we have a score function

665
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,320
that gives us a minimum weight of all

666
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,080
possible colons that can be obtained by

667
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,059
adding bits in the last active row

668
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:17,820
however we also want to consider the

669
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,340
likes active in our score function

670
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,559
and we know that one bit at the input

671
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,740
always impact 3 bit at the output in a

672
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,100
window so here for example the bit glue

673
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,880
at a will always impact 3 bit at B in

674
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,460
the blue window so it means that all bit

675
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,580
in the red window will remain stable and

676
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,799
by stable it means that they will be

677
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,440
present in all this and entrepreneurs so

678
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,360
we can consider them in our score

679
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,980
function

680
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,559
in fact this optimization was done for

681
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,500
SEPTA Runner was an iterated permutation

682
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,700
operate on a 257 bit State and where the

683
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,399
mixing layer is similar by similar I

684
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,140
mean that one bit at the input always

685
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,559
impact 3 bit at the output in a window

686
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,799
so this is an example for row 2.

687
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,559
however when we look at row 0 we see

688
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,159
that in this example the green bit at a

689
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,279
we Embark 3 bit at B in the green window

690
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,220
so in this example we have only three

691
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,500
bits that can be considered in our score

692
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,080
function and what we want is something

693
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,779
similar that what we have for root 2 so

694
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,640
we want the smallest blue window

695
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,440
possible and the biggest red window

696
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,980
possible

697
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,220
what we can do is we can invest the

698
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,380
active bit button by an alternative

699
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,980
coordinate that that has a relation with

700
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,779
its original index

701
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,659
so we have that the raw component of the

702
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,840
linear layer are we formulated in terms

703
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,760
of a new representation

704
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,020
so we go from not considering 29 bit in

705
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,480
our score function to not considering

706
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,700
only six bits in our score function

707
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,580
extension is also done through US

708
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,299
research where we build AR or b0

709
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:15,059
and since PL apply a linear function to

710
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,640
each row independently we can determine

711
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,039
the bit that will remain active at e0

712
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,480
and BR

713
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,179
we also need a score function to lower

714
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:27,539
bound the weight of the L plus 1 1 to

715
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:30,919
the cores that are obtained

716
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,720
in the forward

717
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,880
Direction our score function will lower

718
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,159
bound on the weight of VR while building

719
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,539
AR

720
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:42,779
we follow the approach using to do and

721
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,000
we have the stable bit at BR that are

722
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,940
represented by a stability mask m

723
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,120
and BR and M will give us the stable bit

724
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,559
of br

725
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,600
and if we like

726
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,620
in each active colon of br will also

727
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,500
remain active in all its descendants and

728
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,600
since each active colon contributes at

729
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,640
least two to the weight we can base our

730
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,500
score function on twice the number of

731
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,279
active colon of VR and M

732
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,279
was a backward extension we have two

733
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:17,039
method for the score Function One using

734
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,019
compatible patterns as it was the case

735
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:22,740
for hrp and the envelope space method we

736
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,360
also want to consider the contribution

737
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,480
of a0 in our score function and to do

738
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,000
that we also use stability mask M again

739
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,120
to determine the stable bits of a0

740
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,340
our score function will be divided by

741
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,240
two with one score from score that will

742
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,220
lower down on the minimum of reverse

743
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,919
weight of e0 and the score B that will

744
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,659
lower bound on the weight of b0

745
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,760
for the metal using compatible patterns

746
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,039
we have the two score based computers as

747
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,500
it was okay check B so we only take the

748
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,480
sum of the minimum weight of each colon

749
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,700
in b0

750
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,320
underscore a is based on the stable bit

751
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,380
of e0 again using stability mask

752
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,659
we use this method when we have a small

753
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:10,639
number of active colon in A1

754
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,440
the method using envelope space will

755
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,379
have the score B that is equal twice the

756
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:19,020
number of active colon in A1 since we

757
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,520
have the same number of active colon

758
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,460
invisible and A1

759
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,879
and plus score a will be the number of

760
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,159
space for each active colon position in

761
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,859
A1 and this envelope space has an offset

762
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:34,679
and a basis and the union of all these

763
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,540
envelope space will form an envelope

764
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,480
space Epsilon that is scanned in the

765
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,879
tree base fashion so it gives us the

766
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,800
score a that is based on the table bit

767
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,280
of e0 again using stability mask

768
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,199
we use this method when we have many

769
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,260
active colon in A1

770
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,480
let's have a look on the result that we

771
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,659
got

772
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,140
so we'll prove the type 1 for 3 1 linear

773
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,480
12 and we improve the bond for all other

774
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,040
number of ones

775
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,440
in particular for sixth one we went

776
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,800
beyond two to the power minus 128 for

777
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,440
differential and linear as well for 12

778
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,119
round we went beyond two to the power

779
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,000
minus 256

780
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,700
and we when we compare our work with

781
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,900
other work using sat milp and smt models

782
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,540
we also noted that we are faster so for

783
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,000
example for 401 differential 12 we could

784
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,040
prove the bound of 2 to the power minus

785
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:36,000
86 in 13 CPU days while other could be

786
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,160
only a request estimation of more than

787
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,640
6000 and More Than 3 000 CPU days to

788
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,680
prove the bound of 2 to the power minus

789
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,260
80.

790
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,079
so in conclusion we developed a

791
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,140
dedicated dedicated tools called first

792
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,359
search for asquan and we prove the type

793
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,520
down for three run linear as well and

794
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,440
improve the bond for all other number of

795
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,339
one

796
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:02,000
thank you

797
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:05,660
thank you for your presentation

798
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,180
do you have any questions or comments

799
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,480
thank you for your talk I was wondering

800
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,079
that we discussed in the big circle Kai

801
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,260
presentation that for small Chi function

802
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,480
we can do this exhaustively but as far

803
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,099
as I understand the score function

804
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:32,040
actually needed for the linear layer not

805
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,920
the is box so do you have any comments

806
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,780
on this is it possible to do it in

807
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,000
exhaustive search

808
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,619
um

809
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:43,020
I mean this instead of using this tree

810
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,300
search can you do it exhaustively

811
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,920
because it's smallest box as we

812
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,480
discussed in the big Circle K

813
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,020
presentation

814
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:57,480
I I think you just faster this way

815
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,880
oh sorry sorry

816
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,339
I think just faster this way like uh

817
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:07,200
okay okay and uh I I understand the sub

818
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,780
trailer and escon and the main and the

819
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,880
difference they are in the linear layer

820
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,839
but as a genetic method uh is there any

821
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,720
um is there any basic difference between

822
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,480
these two approach or big Circle K work

823
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,240
and this work that I wanted to know

824
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,899
so if

825
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,280
[Music]

826
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,680
it's okay okay that's why we cannot

827
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,079
really use this technique in what we did

828
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,839
okay okay okay thank you thank you

829
