1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,240
session of today and we have another

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,640
session of boomerang and rectangle's

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,899
attack

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,540
with two nice papers so the first paper

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,240
is automatic search of rectangle attacks

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,759
on Facebook ciphers application to warp

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,340
by if your

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,500
engineer and Lloyd croquette and loik

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,000
will give a talk

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,400
thank you for the introduction

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,519
so today I will speak about our new

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,560
model to compute rectangle attacks on

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,180
Facebook ciphers

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,399
so in the first part I will shortly

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,559
introduce differential crypto analysis

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,260
and boommark attacks then I will speak

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,800
about our new model to compute rectangle

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,899
attacks and I will finish with a

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,379
conclusion

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,879
so what is the differential Crypt

21
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,680
analysis so the the

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,460
method to compute distinguishers in a

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,579
differential Crypt analysis is to have a

24
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,460
plain text P1 to Cipher it with an

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,939
encryption function EK and give us a

26
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,780
cipher C1 then we choose a second plain

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,799
text P2 which is the result of p1xr an

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,920
input difference Delta p we say for it

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,700
also to obtain a C2 and our objective is

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,500
to compute what is the probability to

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,659
obtain the output differences the Delta

32
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,180
C knowing that we have an input a

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,119
different data B

34
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,780
so a variant of this model was uh was

35
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,299
designed by by Wagner which is a

36
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,180
boomerang attacks in the case of Boom

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,520
brung we do not want to compute the

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,259
probability to have a difference from

39
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,680
alpha to Beta but to have a difference

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,380
from Alpha

41
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,840
and then we put an output different

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,840
Delta and we want to compute the

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,780
probability that the

44
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,020
decipher of the two uh the two pairs of

45
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,920
the pairs C3 and C4s go back to Alpha

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,660
so to compute the to compute it we

47
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,180
we separate the cipher into a two-step

48
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,440
function which are e0k and e1k and we

49
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,200
compute one apartheid we go from alpha

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,739
to Beta and one lower Trace

51
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:25,200
we choose a Lambda and the Delta as a

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,520
differences

53
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,220
one variant of this attack is a

54
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,980
rectangle attacks instead of using a

55
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,560
ciphering and deciphering we always use

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,220
a save first ciphering functions

57
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,280
the problem with this representation in

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,440
two trays is that they can be uh have

59
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,879
incompatibilities between the

60
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,160
differences that are in the middle of

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,720
the distinguisher

62
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,060
so sometimes we can have a better

63
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,640
probability and sometimes we can have a

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,220
worse probability than expected

65
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,459
so to Contour this drawback the sandwich

66
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,459
attack was introduced and then we can

67
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,180
compute the probability of the full

68
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,580
Boombox distinguisher by Computing the

69
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,480
probability of the upper trailer

70
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,700
distinguishers so the probability to go

71
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,739
from alpha to Beta

72
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,379
then we compute the probability of the

73
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,840
middle ones which go from a beta to

74
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,080
lulanda and that go back to Beta And we

75
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,780
compute the probability of the lower

76
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,620
part which is from Lambda to the delta

77
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,260
then we can compute the overall

78
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,799
probability by uh multiplying the

79
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,000
probability of each part

80
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,120
the problem with this representation is

81
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,819
that the attacker needs to uh to

82
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,700
indicate of to cut the cipher into the

83
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,879
three parts so uh the learn and the

84
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,799
quarters introduce a new kind of model

85
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,379
that allow to compute the overall

86
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,440
probability without selecting the runs

87
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,599
which belong to the upper to the middle

88
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,738
and to the lower part

89
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,739
the model of

90
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,459
of the Run encoders work in two steps

91
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,279
and we are we need to add one more step

92
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,199
which is a key recovery to compute the

93
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,580
attack complexity

94
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,440
so in the first step they compute the

95
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,479
truncated Defensor characteristic which

96
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,820
is an abstraction of the problem

97
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,979
and in the second step for each

98
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,259
Tranquility differential Boomerang they

99
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:40,380
compute the instantiation of this

100
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,040
truncated Boomerang and that give that

101
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,320
gives the

102
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,600
manga probability once we have the woman

103
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,560
distinguisher probability we can make

104
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,320
compute clustering analysis to refine

105
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,139
the probability of the distinguisher and

106
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,020
we need to add one key recovery part to

107
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,820
uh to be able to complete the attack

108
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,479
complexity

109
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,820
so in the model of the run and quotas uh

110
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,340
one woman transition is represented by

111
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,340
the following variables so we have uh

112
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,520
four uh differences which are alpha

113
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,340
along the beta and Delta

114
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,560
and we have two trays which are

115
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,280
represented as encryption and decryption

116
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,699
so in the encryption uh in the

117
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,699
encryption phase we have three variables

118
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,280
so a big data indicates if the

119
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,160
transition is active or not

120
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,460
3x and the 3sb indicates if the input

121
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,419
differences or the output differences of

122
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,060
the transition need to be fixed or need

123
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,660
to be known to to compute the the

124
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,820
distinguishable probability

125
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,979
we have the same variables but for the

126
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,160
lowercase which are a free x low a big

127
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,460
Delta low and the first below

128
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,699
the problem is that the model of dolon

129
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,039
and Al was designed to be used on the

130
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,220
face on SPN ciphers and was applied to

131
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,820
skinny but we want to use it to uh to be

132
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,320
able to compute a boom long

133
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,960
distinguisher on phase State Network

134
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,800
so in the case of SPN ciphers when we

135
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,620
want to decipher the the messages we

136
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,520
need to inverse if each set function of

137
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,100
the ciphers but in the case of the

138
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,039
faceted networks we always use the same

139
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,300
encryption function we only inverse the

140
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,360
the branches between the third part of

141
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,259
the ciphers and then this change as a

142
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,020
kind of boomerang transitions that we

143
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,940
are able to use

144
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,699
so on the left we have the boom one

145
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,740
connectivity table that was designed for

146
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,860
SPN ciphers and on the right you have a

147
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,139
face type woman connectivity tables that

148
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:05,340
are used that were designed for faceted

149
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,720
Networks

150
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,419
so you can see that only on the left you

151
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,520
can Define one

152
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,479
one probability that use only Alpha and

153
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,940
the Delta as a parameters

154
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,120
but if you are on the right as you only

155
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,800
use a s box in uh directed Direction

156
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,440
you can be able to compute the

157
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,340
probability uh from Alpha and Lambda but

158
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,599
you can not use you cannot compute

159
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,880
probability that go from alpha to Beta

160
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,639
and go back to Alpha so we need to use a

161
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,139
different uh transitions that uh

162
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:50,639
then that was the defend for SPN

163
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,919
so we change the rules that were

164
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,440
designed in the model of the run and L

165
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,000
to match the SPN transition and we adapt

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,539
them to only use uh as boxes in forward

167
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,300
Direction and that give us the new rules

168
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,819
that are defined on the right and that

169
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,759
are the rules that are

170
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,800
um designed to match the facetail

171
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,340
conditions

172
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,199
now I will speak about our new model

173
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,460
that was applied to up so what what was

174
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,780
presented as at SEC 2020 by your bank

175
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,960
and quotas it was designed to be a

176
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,059
compact our implementation

177
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,299
and uh you have the description on the

178
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,899
safer just here so for each round you

179
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,940
have one Xbox function and we add a

180
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,040
xor between the state and the k

181
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,800
then we Excel the two branches and for

182
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,920
some branches you add one constant for

183
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,339
each round

184
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,260
so uh for our model we have the same

185
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,300
Boomerang representation that was done

186
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,700
by the model of dulon and quarters and

187
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,120
we have the same search steps but we

188
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,820
have some differences we add some

189
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,459
optimization uh that was dedicated to

190
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,399
app to improve the computation process

191
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,019
and if we change the s-box

192
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,600
representation so we change the S blocks

193
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,320
rules and as the transition tables to

194
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,080
merge phase tail networks on the same

195
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,200
tables and we also integrate Jack laser

196
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,880
attack complexity in the optimal

197
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,380
optimization process

198
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,420
so um how to compute the attack

199
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,899
complexity uh we need to add some rounds

200
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,060
before and after our distinguisher to

201
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,820
conclude the attack complexity

202
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
and for in the case of the attack of the

203
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,640
zero and the quarters you have the two

204
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,940
predominant term of the data complexity

205
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,740
that are just here

206
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,100
so the first parameter of this uh two

207
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,320
equations are s which is the number of

208
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,600
quartets that are required to match the

209
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,240
Boom distinguisher

210
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,760
we also have n which is the number of

211
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,220
bits of the block of the ciphers

212
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,600
we have NB uh ND and NF that uh that can

213
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,060
be computed as the number of runs that

214
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,459
are added before the distinguisher the

215
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,200
number of front of the distinguishers

216
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,540
and the number of funds that are added

217
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,240
after the distinguisher

218
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,700
P Square Q square and error are the

219
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,940
probability of our bong distinguishers

220
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,779
and you can compute also a MB which is

221
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,700
the number of bits which need to be

222
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,180
guessed in the K and RF which is the

223
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,720
number of bits of the ciphertext

224
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,200
which is active which are active

225
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,579
so um we can directly integrate this

226
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,860
kind of equation in the model to

227
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,440
optimize the overall time complexity

228
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,640
instead instead of

229
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,779
improving only the distinguisher

230
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,640
probability

231
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,720
so our new model works with these steps

232
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,980
so in the first step we compute

233
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,140
the the abstraction of our attack

234
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,320
complexity so it is an approximation and

235
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,399
in the second step we improve our result

236
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,519
and we are we ensure that the attack

237
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,640
complexity given in the Second Step will

238
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,839
be the best attack complexity that is a

239
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,680
uh that is computable by our model and

240
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,079
we can add some clustering analysis to

241
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,200
refine the distinguisher probability and

242
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,019
to improve the accuracy of our attack

243
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,620
complexity

244
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,720
so now I will show some results on the

245
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,480
web so to compute the distinguisher on

246
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,540
work we have the following results

247
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,959
so until 22 runs we can compute the

248
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,880
distinguisher probability in less than

249
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,440
uh two days

250
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,600
but the number of days the time grows

251
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,959
exponentially when we add some runs but

252
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,140
we see that for 23 runs the

253
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,839
distinguisher is not usable in practice

254
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,180
in the attacks

255
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,360
have a complexity Ayers and the excess

256
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,740
exhaustive key search

257
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,959
we also test the accuracy of our model

258
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,620
by uh evaluating

259
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,519
experimentalized distinguisher

260
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,579
probability of our model so in the model

261
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,620
currents you have the probability that

262
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,579
was that was computed by our model and

263
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,560
on the experimental column you have the

264
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,560
the experimental evaluation of our

265
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,820
distinguishers

266
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,459
and you see that we have a very close

267
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:00,300
results but the more we add the rounds

268
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,700
as the biggest the gap between our model

269
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,180
approximation and the experimentary

270
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,420
evaluation uh increased

271
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,600
so this model allows us to find a new

272
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,440
Boombox distinguisher on the 23 runs

273
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,560
this Boombox distinguisher was beaten by

274
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,019
the model of adipo which was uh

275
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,920
presented uh just after this session

276
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,000
and we compute we are also able to

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,120
compute why new uh rectangle attacks on

278
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,959
26 round of work

279
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,019
we also apply our model to Twain and L

280
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,800
block s and uh Portland and blue case we

281
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,740
find a closed state to the art

282
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,740
distinguishers

283
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,180
to conclude we provide a new automatic

284
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,459
tool to compute the rectangle attacks as

285
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:59,760
can be easily adapted to uh over a face

286
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,519
Networks

287
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,260
the model can be overtaken by the model

288
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,540
of adipo when the clustering effect is

289
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,980
important

290
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,519
but even if we made a concession of a

291
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,160
distinguisher probability we can obtain

292
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,760
a better attacks than only optimizing a

293
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,620
distinguisher probability

294
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,839
that's all thank you for your attention

295
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,480
thank you loik we will take some

296
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,639
questions do you have questions in the

297
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,500
room in Kobe

298
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,100
yes

299
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,680
hi Luke thanks for your presentation

300
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,660
would you please tell us about the

301
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,940
running time for of your tool to find a

302
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,100
23 round distinguisher for war just the

303
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,380
distinguish another whole attack what

304
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,060
can you repeat yeah the running time

305
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,940
yeah your tool to find a 23 round

306
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,480
distinguisher I think it's about uh

307
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,360
uh two weeks yeah yeah thanks so much

308
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,060
do we have more questions

309
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,000
so nobody here do we have questions in

310
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,839
Beijing Maybe

311
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,399
I don't see any more question I have a

312
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,720
short question

313
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,420
um you didn't talk about the tools you

314
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,060
used to model the attack I think you use

315
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,399
constraint programming can you comment

316
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,680
on how this compares to mail per set

317
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,060
because we've seen different papers

318
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,760
using different type of tools

319
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,660
in fact the the model was done in two

320
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,680
steps just

321
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,459
just say the ear so in the first step we

322
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,199
use the constraint programming but the

323
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,440
underlying server is a set solver which

324
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,940
is a picket set

325
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,839
because the model is mainly working on a

326
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,519
Boolean variables to set solvers really

327
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,820
dedicated to to this kind of constraints

328
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,300
and in the second step we use a Shoku

329
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,699
which is a constraint programming solver

330
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,399
we use this tool because in the second

331
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,699
step we need to

332
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:24,800
to represent the Xbox probabilities and

333
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,620
this kind of constraints are not really

334
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,620
well

335
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,899
are not really well uh implementing the

336
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:40,560
set or mihp solvers so in the case of

337
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,680
constraint programming you have a

338
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,320
constraint tables that are already

339
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,860
dedicated to this kind of representation

340
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,620
that's why we use a set for the third

341
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,560
step and the CP for the second step

342
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,638
okay thank you

343
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,380
so if there are no more questions we

344
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,240
will move to the next talk

345
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,520
thank you thank you

346
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,640
so the next paper is titled throwing

347
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,559
boomerangs into Feister structures

348
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,559
application to clefair warp L block and

349
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,480
block s and Twine

350
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,480
it's a paper by Jose nadipur Marcel

351
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,419
nagelar and Maria ashleather and the

352
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,740
speaker will be Hussain

353
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,179
thanks for introduction

354
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,580
hello everyone I hope you have enjoyed

355
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,080
the conference so far

356
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,120
I'm Jose hadipur from grass University

357
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,820
of Technology and I'm very pleased to

358
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,460
present our work entitled Brewing boom

359
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,980
ranks into Feister structures which is a

360
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,900
joint work with master nagala and Maria

361
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,460
Ashley so a long story short when we

362
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,960
started this work in the first year of

363
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,640
my PhD there was no tool to find

364
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,260
Boomerang distinguishers or fighter

365
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,419
sniper so we decided to fill this Gap

366
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:56,700
and we managed to provide a very easy

367
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,340
and fast a very easy to use and fast

368
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,140
method to find Boomerang distinguishers

369
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,660
for Firestone ciphers we applied it to

370
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,520
several black snipers such as calefia

371
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,340
warp l-block and toyne and we got a

372
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,860
series of improved results uh

373
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,900
to mention just a few we improved the

374
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,820
boomerang distinctions of warp by two

375
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,200
rounds we improved the boomerang

376
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,820
distinguisher and Boomerang attack on

377
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,799
clivia by one round

378
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,860
by the way our method is not limited to

379
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,360
final snipers it's essentially

380
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,200
applicable to any strongly aligned Xbox

381
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,299
such as skinny as

382
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,000
so this is my plan for the rest of this

383
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,919
talk first of all I will tell you which

384
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,740
parameters are effective in the

385
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,080
probability of uh in the success

386
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,640
probability of boomerang distinguisher

387
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,039
then I will show you how we can create a

388
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,140
constraint programming model to

389
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,299
considerably effective parameter into

390
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,880
accounts and find a nearly optimal rain

391
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,100
distinguisher then I will discuss about

392
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,559
one of the applications of our tool to

393
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,600
warp and conclude the talk

394
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,299
so let's start by the first part

395
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,980
assume that you have two short

396
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,919
differential transitions for black

397
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,080
Cipher e with a super high probabilities

398
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,240
p and Q respectively but they are they

399
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,840
cannot be linked because Delta 2 and

400
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,720
nobla 2 are not the same you cannot link

401
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,539
them in a basic differential setting in

402
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,520
this case boom rank distinguisher comes

403
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,380
to help and the core idea of boomerang

404
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,240
distinguisher is actually combining

405
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,860
these two short definitions in

406
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,840
adaptively chosen playing text cipherty

407
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,539
setting to do so we encrypt a pair of

408
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,280
plain text with different Delta 1 then

409
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,559
we modify the drive cyber takes by the

410
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,539
same difference Noble three then we

411
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,940
decrypt them to drive the corresponding

412
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,500
plain text and we check if the

413
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,200
difference between P3 and P4 is Delta 1

414
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,220
or not

415
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,200
you see four differential transitions in

416
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,100
this shape

417
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,520
if this uh uh two same transitions at

418
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,200
the top and two same transitions at the

419
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,220
bottom

420
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,260
if the upper and lower differential

421
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,000
transitions are statistically

422
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,400
independent the policy of getting Delta

423
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,679
1 back on the other side is actually the

424
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,360
multiplication of probabilities for

425
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,039
these four differential transitions

426
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,559
which is PS Square t squared

427
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,520
but these two trails are not independent

428
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,440
in practice

429
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,700
that's why the idea of sandwich

430
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,100
distinguisher was proposed uh in

431
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,419
sandwich distinguisher we essentially

432
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:21,539
put an additional part in the middle of

433
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,220
distinguisher to model the dependency

434
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,679
between upper and lower trade

435
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,500
in other words a sandwich distinguisher

436
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,320
is essentially composed of three uh

437
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,960
small distinguishers two basic

438
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,700
differential distinguishers at the top

439
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,860
and bottom and a small boomerang

440
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,840
distinguisher in the middle

441
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,059
just like a sandwich

442
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,740
if the probability of two basic

443
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,120
differential distinguishers at the top

444
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,880
at bottom are p and Q respectively and

445
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,200
the probability of a small boring

446
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,740
distinguisher in the middle BR then the

447
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,059
entire quality of sand which

448
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:57,500
distinguisher is PS squared TS squared r

449
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,179
we have enough information about p and Q

450
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,820
we know that P can be determined by the

451
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,460
number of active as boxes in e0 Q can be

452
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,559
determined by the number of active

453
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:12,480
responses in E1 but uh what about r

454
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,280
let's take a look at the middle part in

455
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,140
more detail this shape represents the

456
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,640
middle part of Sandwich extinguisher

457
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,980
when it includes only one Xbox layer

458
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,799
it's the simplest case

459
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,419
uh

460
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:27,960
as you can see if the s-box in the

461
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,820
middle of sandwich distinguisher is

462
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,000
active in at most one of the upper or

463
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,520
loyal Trail then we can bypass it for

464
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,559
free the probability of boomerang

465
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:41,159
transition over this box is one

466
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,240
if this box is active in at most one of

467
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,580
the upper and lower trays you see if

468
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,100
Delta is zero or Noble is zero we can

469
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,260
bypass it for free it's called a ladder

470
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,200
switch it's some sort of super positive

471
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,059
dependency between upper and lower

472
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,220
Trails you have always heard about the

473
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,380
negative side of dependency but this is

474
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,500
the positive side of dependency

475
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,780
this is for file subscribers they are

476
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,700
almost the same the only difference is

477
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,559
that the inverse of this box doesn't

478
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,000
come into effect

479
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,360
but the ladder switch still works if the

480
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,659
input of this box is zero

481
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:20,400
in one of the upper or lowest rail we

482
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,940
again pass this box for free uh the

483
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,320
probability of moonlight transition over

484
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,140
this box is one

485
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,940
so um

486
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,799
I want to show you a very interesting

487
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,080
example regarding the effect of leather

488
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,480
switch this shape represents 11 rounds

489
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,520
of a skinny

490
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,480
this Trail this differential Trail

491
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,280
which is colored in red

492
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,940
is shown to be impossible in pt22 the

493
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,580
paper which was presented yesterday

494
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,980
these differential Trails is also shown

495
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,960
to be impossible because of dependency

496
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,000
between round cues you know if you

497
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,679
compute this probability using DDT

498
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,419
framework

499
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,340
um you can say okay the policy should be

500
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,799
for example two to the minus under 79

501
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,960
but if you go through the details and

502
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,640
check the dependency between round keys

503
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,159
this differential Trail showed to be

504
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,740
impossible but when we put them together

505
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,780
we get a boomerang distincture with

506
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,059
probability one that works for any key

507
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:25,559
for any plain text everywhere anytime

508
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:28,500
because there is no overlap between the

509
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,900
red and blue propagation over the Xbox

510
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,240
layer remember the ladder switch

511
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,820
all of the s-boxes in this shape are

512
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,280
active in at most

513
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,039
one of the upper or lower trays

514
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,840
theoretically the probability should be

515
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,539
one I experimentally verified it by 2 to

516
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:48,720
the N random keys or plain text is

517
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,340
policy is one

518
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,200
so what it means

519
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,440
it has two I think lessons the first

520
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,020
lesson is the impact of leather switch

521
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,220
if you want to find a Bound for R the

522
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,419
probability of boomerang switch a

523
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,440
boomerang switch in the middle of

524
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,600
Sandwich extinguisher it's enough to

525
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,940
only count the number of common activist

526
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,580
boxes between upper and lower trade

527
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,500
we should just we just we should just

528
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,980
ignore this boxes which are active in uh

529
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,340
only one of the upper or lowest rays

530
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,380
and the second lesson is that uh

531
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,240
dependency issues in the in building

532
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,140
block Trails of boomerang switch has no

533
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,720
impact on the validity of the resulting

534
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,120
Boomerang structure you see two uh

535
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,059
impossible Trails yield a boomerang

536
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,700
signature with probability one

537
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,760
so let's recap this section uh

538
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,059
we wanted to see the effective we wanted

539
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:46,799
to discuss about the effective parameter

540
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,140
in the entire probability in PS squared

541
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,940
key Square R formula p is mostly

542
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,500
determined by the number of activist

543
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,120
boxes in e0

544
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,100
Q is mostly determined by the number of

545
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,200
active responses in E1

546
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,720
and R is determined by the number of

547
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,179
common active Sparks between the upper

548
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:05,480
and lower propagation in the middle part

549
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,039
if we can create a constraint

550
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,159
programming model that count uh that

551
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:13,080
counts the number of active responses in

552
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,880
e0 and E1 and the number of common X

553
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,279
squares Plus in EM we can have a rough

554
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,919
estimation of probability

555
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:21,419
in addition the cost of calculus boxes

556
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,080
in e0 and E1 is higher than the cost of

557
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,539
common actors box in EM because of the

558
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:28,919
exponent of PQ

559
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,900
the exponent of P here and P Squared Q

560
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,200
squared is 2 but the exponent of R is 1.

561
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,059
so with that in mind let me introduce

562
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:37,620
our new method to search for we rank

563
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,140
distincture it's pretty simple

564
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,820
and fast enough

565
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,100
it has three main steps the first step

566
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,400
is uh finding good truncated trails

567
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,020
which aims at minimizing the number of

568
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,240
activist boxes in e0 and E1 and common

569
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,340
activist box in EM

570
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,100
the second step is instantiating the

571
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,659
discovered truncated trails with

572
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,900
concrete differential trays and lastly

573
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,000
when we have concrete differential trays

574
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,940
in hand we compute p and Q and R

575
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,279
separately we put them together to

576
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,659
compute the entire probability of

577
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,179
Sandwich extinguisher let's take a take

578
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,039
a look at the first step in more detail

579
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,320
this is actually the most important step

580
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,380
of our method in this step we divide a

581
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,360
block Cipher into three parts

582
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,460
we create a constraint programming model

583
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,039
to encode the propagation of truncated

584
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:31,260
Trail in e0 and em in forward Direction

585
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,000
but when we switch from e0 to em

586
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,159
we switch from the propagation from the

587
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,260
normal propagation to a propagation with

588
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,059
probability you want

589
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:45,840
we create another CPU model to encode

590
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,720
the propagation in E1 and em in backward

591
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,620
Direction

592
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,720
again when we when we propagate the

593
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,700
propagation when we propagate uh the

594
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,220
difference through E1 as usual we switch

595
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,720
the propagation with probability one

596
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,039
when we go to em

597
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,980
we are also interested to encode uh the

598
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,400
common activist boxes in the middle part

599
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,799
assume that U and L represents the

600
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,900
activeness of the sparxus in upper and

601
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,279
lower trade

602
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,380
to detect the common actress boxes we

603
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,940
Define an additional variable for each

604
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,159
box in the middle the additional

605
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,539
variable s

606
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:27,000
and then we include three inequalities

607
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,340
for each Sparks in the middle

608
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,100
accordingly s is equal to 1 if and only

609
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,440
if the corresponding Xbox is active in

610
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,779
both upper and lower trade so this way

611
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,120
we can count the number of common

612
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,039
activist marks in the middle

613
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,279
then we include an objective function to

614
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,740
minimize the number of active Sparks in

615
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,080
e0 E1 and the common activist box the

616
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,340
number of combinative source in the

617
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,740
middle we also assign some integer rates

618
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,940
uh which are denoted by w0w m and W1 to

619
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,659
adjust the probability

620
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,640
so uh the in the next in this next step

621
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,159
uh when we have tricator Trail we

622
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:06,900
instantiate the

623
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,820
concrete differential Trail for e0 and

624
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,620
E1

625
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,880
however

626
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,860
after finding the

627
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,960
concrete differential trails

628
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,059
we only fixed the difference in four

629
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,440
positions

630
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,919
namely in the input output of e0 and E1

631
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,080
when you fix the difference in the input

632
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,539
output of e0 and E1 you can compute p

633
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:30,659
and Q using a using the existing tools

634
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,520
and you you can take the clustering

635
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,980
effect into account because easy run E1

636
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,700
are short enough

637
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,659
in addition you have the input and

638
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,240
output difference for the s multipur in

639
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,880
the middle so you can compute its

640
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,399
probability using VCT framework fpcd

641
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:48,659
framework or you can do it

642
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:49,980
experimentally

643
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,320
we do it we did it mostly experimentally

644
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,779
because the probability of em is large

645
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:56,640
enough in all of our applications and we

646
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,039
can easily compute this probability

647
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,980
using experimental approach

648
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,360
let's discuss about one of the

649
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,799
applications of our

650
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,720
uh tool

651
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,240
this simple comment represents the usage

652
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,799
of our tool it receives only three

653
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,659
integer numbers

654
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,940
which specify the length of each part in

655
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,399
Sandwich extinguisher for example assume

656
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,720
that you want to find a 23 round

657
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,700
distinguisher for Warp

658
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,059
6 10 7 is a good choice because

659
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,679
the full the legs are fully efficient

660
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,679
for warp is 10. so it's best to choose

661
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,659
the length of the middle part

662
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:33,720
uh 2b10

663
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,940
and running this command takes 20

664
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,059
seconds on a regular laptop what you

665
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:40,740
receive is the boomerang distinguisher

666
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,059
it's a specification and a rough

667
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:45,020
estimation of its probability

668
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,760
this tray represents the round function

669
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,980
of warp uh

670
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,140
we applied our two to war

671
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,360
and in this animation I want to show you

672
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,120
how our method works we propagate the

673
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,500
difference in opposite way

674
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,539
as you can see the dense part represents

675
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:07,620
em

676
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,080
and the sports Parts represents e0 and

677
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,220
E1

678
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,880
here the length of em is 10. as you can

679
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,059
see only three Sparks comes into effect

680
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:21,600
all of the other spices in the middle

681
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,960
are just uh ineffective you know we can

682
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,559
bypass all of them for free and

683
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,179
the policy of middle parts is large

684
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,880
enough to to compute it experimentally

685
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,480
it's my 2 to the minus 4.5 58 you can

686
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,820
just uh experimentally

687
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,860
um measure it you can compute it on

688
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,299
regular laptop

689
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:43,440
so

690
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,159
um

691
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,740
this is a summary of our results for

692
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,059
work the best previous distinguisher

693
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:54,059
covered up to 21 round of Warp

694
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:57,120
but we discovered a 23 round

695
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,100
distinguisher which again has a much

696
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,600
higher probability

697
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,700
we proved that distinguisher by two

698
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,980
rounds but take into account running

699
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,620
this command takes only 20 seconds

700
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,559
on a regular laptop because our model is

701
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,899
the simplest model we don't go through

702
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,179
the Beats level because we believe for a

703
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:17,039
strongly aligned Cipher you don't need

704
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,500
to go to the through the Beats level

705
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,120
if you want to find a good boomerang

706
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,340
distinguisher

707
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,140
award-wise model is quite enough

708
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,539
and we come to the end the star end of

709
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:30,059
the start where I would just like to

710
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:32,279
thank you for your attention before I

711
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:34,620
finish let me just say that uh our tool

712
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,179
is publicly available in this guitar

713
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:37,860
repository in the combat repository

714
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,520
during this work he also developed a an

715
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,679
open source tool which is a Xbox

716
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,340
analyzer and it can be used to

717
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,200
encode the differential linear or

718
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,080
integral properties of Sparks and it can

719
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,600
be used as a sub-module of Xbox class in

720
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,658
sagemath thanks I hope it will be useful

721
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,399
in Q was saying do we have questions in

722
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,699
the room

723
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,880
yeah thank you for your talk so you said

724
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,760
that for highly aligned Cipher you don't

725
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,519
need to go to the beat level uh can you

726
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,159
explain this a bit more I mean thanks

727
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:30,659
for your question

728
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,159
um

729
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,919
let me see if I can find a picture maybe

730
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:36,299
this one

731
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:40,080
beats well to this question you know to

732
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,519
find a

733
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,260
to find a good Boomerang distinguisher

734
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,720
what you need is actually

735
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,679
um

736
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:49,679
finding a good truncated Trail not a bit

737
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,960
wise differential Trail

738
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,480
because the leather switch plays the

739
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,940
whiter role it's the it's the strongest

740
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,279
uh switching effect in Boomerang

741
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,840
analysis

742
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,480
uh so if you take it into account you

743
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,580
can find a nearly Optimum distinguisher

744
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,159
and it is uh the thing that you can

745
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,580
model in a worldwide uh MLP or

746
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,020
constraint programming model you don't

747
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,139
need to go through the wheat level you

748
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,960
don't need to model the DDT it's just

749
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,940
like counting the number of common

750
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,918
activist boxes

751
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:26,599
it's also the case for skinny AES craft

752
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:30,179
warp or Cliff yeah I can mention some

753
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,699
other strongly aligned black snipers but

754
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,500
it's not suitable for present gift

755
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,859
because they have bitwise operations

756
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,300
this doesn't work

757
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,219
but for essentially a line Cipher I

758
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:43,260
think according to previous experiences

759
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,480
for example comparing this paper with

760
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,099
the previous one or our FSA 22 paper

761
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,918
um we got a

762
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,260
even better results in a shorter time

763
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,859
you know it's it means a word wise model

764
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:01,920
are sufficient or strongly aligned by

765
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,119
Cipher

766
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,339
yeah I'm not sure if I I have answered

767
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,640
the question

768
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:16,320
uh I have a question regarding the time

769
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,720
uh so for example uh if you change the

770
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,760
number of middle rounds for example from

771
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,820
10 to 8 to 6 like this then while

772
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,500
keeping the overall number rounds same

773
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,440
how does your time change or the tool

774
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,619
okay if anything correctly you mean if

775
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,900
we change the configuration for example

776
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,119
here yeah the number of middle rounds oh

777
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,920
yeah while keeping the total number of

778
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,140
rounds the same is the time still same

779
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,839
for your tool or it changes yeah uh so

780
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,000
let's review the method it has it has

781
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,500
three steps right the first step is

782
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,140
defining truncated pattern then you

783
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,240
instantiate with concrete

784
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,940
these two steps the time for these two

785
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,800
steps doesn't change

786
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,380
uh and it doesn't matter if you get the

787
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,560
middle part so for example 10 Rounds or

788
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,619
less than or more than 10 rounds but for

789
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:06,780
the last step when you want to compute

790
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,400
its probability

791
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,760
if you uh if you if you consider the

792
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,280
middle part very long

793
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,500
what goes wrong is that you know

794
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:21,480
uh it's first of all it's not necessary

795
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,400
you know I mean I mean the full

796
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,400
diffusion of Cipher gives us a good uh

797
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,579
indication for choosing the length of em

798
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:31,500
if for example first you need the length

799
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,020
of the will diffusion I as far as I

800
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,940
remember should be seven or six if you

801
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,500
choose the middle part more than six

802
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,660
rounds is useless because dependency

803
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,940
disappear after six or seven rounds you

804
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,560
don't need to choose the middle part you

805
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,180
know do you remember we choose the

806
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,280
middle part to model dependency so if

807
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,720
you choose it longer than six rounds

808
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,760
it's useless

809
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,980
but uh

810
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,020
another problem is that if you choose it

811
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,820
too long the probability of middle part

812
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,359
cannot be computed experimentally

813
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:01,800
even if you want to compute

814
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,480
theoretically the number of involved

815
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,880
parameters might be very high and again

816
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,820
your program stuck in the

817
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,980
in the computation

818
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,020
so

819
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,700
I would say I would say the running time

820
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,220
change for just the last step when you

821
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,260
want to compute the probability of each

822
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,079
parts but for the two First Steps it

823
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,760
doesn't change yeah

824
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,320
okay thank you you're welcome

825
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,980
so there's one more question

826
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,359
thank you so yeah uh

827
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,660
my general question so what about the uh

828
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,300
result uh on twine

829
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,900
is there any progress unfortunately I

830
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,859
didn't put them into the slides but uh

831
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:56,040
uh four four clivia and warp we

832
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,079
significantly significantly improve the

833
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,880
previous results by a number of rounds

834
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,880
but for toying L block we just improved

835
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,220
the probability not the number of rounds

836
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,780
but I don't have the exact number

837
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,140
numbers in my slides but as far as I

838
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,240
remember the aspects of Towing and

839
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,240
Adblock was uh

840
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,400
stronger against Boomerang analysis this

841
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,980
is the ethicity of War

842
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,980
um it's it represents the the the the

843
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,220
s-rings of a Sparks against

844
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,040
Boomerang analysis you see there are for

845
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,640
example two uh

846
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,500
uh cases where

847
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,660
you have a lot of large entries in the

848
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,160
table this is some sort of weakness

849
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,579
because if you choose two or a as the

850
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,020
input of boomerang switch in the middle

851
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,480
you can make the most of clustering

852
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,839
effect you get a very high probability

853
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,440
distinguisher but for toying and a block

854
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,460
you cannot find such a

855
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,000
I remember but sorry I didn't put the

856
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,060
exact numbers for 29 okay but you're

857
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,980
welcome to refer to the paper I think we

858
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,240
have

859
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,140
uh discussed about this question in our

860
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,879
paper thanks for your question yeah

861
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:18,480
so your attack is independent of the key

862
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,400
schedule right it's a CL key attack

863
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,640
yeah yeah

864
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,720
so that the key skill doesn't come into

865
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,700
effect because but there is there is no

866
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,339
difference the key schedule

867
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:34,099
so yeah

868
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:37,380
our work is mostly focused on the boom

869
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,300
on the distinguisher part

870
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,220
but it can be simply extended for the

871
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,780
key recovery I actually did it after

872
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,579
publishing this work I applied this

873
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:46,680
method so on a skinny as you can see for

874
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,820
example in my first example here

875
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,300
this is just one one of the outputs of

876
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,640
the tool or a screening yeah I applied

877
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,320
it to a skinny as I climbed this

878
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,960
applicable to any align black ciphers

879
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,540
but and we extended for kirikori as well

880
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,720
it's not complete but it's it's it can

881
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,119
be extended for key recovery okay as far

882
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:09,859
as

883
00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:12,480
finding the distinguisher so the key

884
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,480
schedule is not done yeah related yeah

885
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,599
so in any key schedule yeah yeah

886
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,359
things as long as it's a single key

887
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:23,579
distinguisher yeah okay yeah thank you

888
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:26,359
you're welcome

889
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,920
thank you do we have some questions

890
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,380
online or in Beijing

891
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,619
so I guess no more questions

892
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:44,160
uh I have maybe a short question

893
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,820
um

894
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,220
you you have results on warp you have a

895
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,260
better Boomerang distinguisher than in

896
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,240
the previous paper

897
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,460
can you explain what is different in

898
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,140
your work compared to the work is it

899
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,880
because I optimize for an attack on your

900
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,619
only optimize for a distinguisher or

901
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:02,940
other other parameters uh

902
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,520
if I'm not mistaken they also try to

903
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,320
find the best distinguishers beside

904
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,680
finding that attack but again they

905
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,140
I think the problem is that they try to

906
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,300
make the model very accurate they

907
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,099
modeled they they went through the Beast

908
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,060
levels

909
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,859
when you go through debut levels and you

910
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:22,260
want to compute everything theoretically

911
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,240
or

912
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,820
take the clustering fix into account you

913
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,260
know all of these stuff

914
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,900
the model the stocks in running time in

915
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,760
the in the running time it never

916
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,220
terminates so you have to sacrifice the

917
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,960
accuracy you have to include some

918
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,579
additional constraints

919
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,740
and

920
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:46,200
and uh due to the I think

921
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,020
uh

922
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,260
uh complexity of the resulting model I

923
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,359
think that uh

924
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:58,079
maybe that's the reason that

925
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,060
we got a better result because our model

926
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,180
is simple and

927
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,880
it's as I mentioned it it seems the

928
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,599
award-wise model is enough for because

929
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,420
let me clarify this um you know for the

930
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,420
middle part uh or the middle part for

931
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,560
example here

932
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,780
if you want to compute the probability

933
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,820
theoretically assume that there are

934
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,680
innocent of three s bars three common as

935
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,740
far as there are ten common Xbox

936
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,700
in the middle

937
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,560
if you want to do it theoretically it

938
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,579
doesn't work

939
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,619
you can drive the formula but when you

940
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:33,359
want to evaluate this formula the

941
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,000
complexity could be two to the 50 to the

942
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,599
60 can do it so we start sacrificing the

943
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,940
act in the accuracy and

944
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,760
it causes you to get a maybe worse

945
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,320
result

946
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,619
uh but if you just uh

947
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:55,400
I think

948
00:42:56,339 --> 00:43:00,720
uh it's just the the problem uh the

949
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,200
efficiency versus accuracy problem

950
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,290
[Music]

951
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,680
maybe the main reason is that we just

952
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,260
compute the probability of middle part

953
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,880
experimentally

954
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,300
and we get a maybe a more accurate or

955
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,760
okay which is close more accurate uh

956
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,260
probability which is closer to the

957
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,460
actual probability if you want to

958
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,560
estimate theoretically

959
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,380
yeah okay thank you thank you for a

960
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,880
question

961
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,839
so thank you

962
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,740
according to my understanding you have

963
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,920
you first built uh byte the mode in a by

964
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,180
the layer right

965
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,660
in the Bible the translated model then

966
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,480
you find the compatible uh yeah yeah

967
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,319
yeah so do you find some cases where uh

968
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,780
after you find a solution for the

969
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,180
truncated model then you cannot find a

970
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,359
solution in the byte model it's in a

971
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:04,260
video did you find some cases thanks for

972
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,060
your very interesting question it could

973
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,160
be the case but as far as I know for

974
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,660
many cyphers that have this issue you

975
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,099
can again put some constraints in the

976
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:14,579
world level model to get rid of this in

977
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:16,079
possible

978
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,240
or tranquiliters for example for AES

979
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,339
if you

980
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:26,460
you may find some truncated trades that

981
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,040
cannot never be

982
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,740
instantiated with real bitwise ways but

983
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,579
as far as I know for all for as far as I

984
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,140
know to the best of my knowledge for

985
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,660
most of the strongly aligned by black

986
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,520
snipers we can again put some additional

987
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,920
constraints in the world level model

988
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,960
to get rid of this

989
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,380
impossible uh Trails tranquila Trails it

990
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,780
can be handled I would say again in the

991
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,060
world level in the world wise model we

992
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,800
don't need to go

993
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,760
through the beat level

994
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,020
I myself uh

995
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,480
no but I think in the previous papers it

996
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,060
has been discussed here there it's

997
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,839
possible I think yeah

998
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:15,960
okay thank you so let's thanks uh sign

999
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,940
again and all the speakers of this

1000
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,160
session

1001
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,819
you want to answer

1002
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,480
I just want to add some extra

1003
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,960
information to the previous question so

1004
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,640
I think the main difference is is that

1005
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,859
when we compute the probability of the

1006
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:36,900
distinguisher we are actually Computing

1007
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,140
the

1008
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:45,060
so we fix each different of each word of

1009
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:48,420
the site first and when uh in their work

1010
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,819
as they are Computing experimentally the

1011
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:53,099
probability of the distinguisher

1012
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:55,680
they obtain a better approximation a

1013
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,440
better evaluation of the probability as

1014
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,339
we are not Computing the same things so

1015
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,800
I think there is the main differences

1016
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,619
that why there are better probabilities

1017
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:09,780
as

1018
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,599
that so thank you huge for explanation

1019
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:16,380
yeah you made my life easier

1020
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,740
okay so now it's over right

1021
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,319
so let's thank all the speakers and we

1022
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,920
can go to lunch
