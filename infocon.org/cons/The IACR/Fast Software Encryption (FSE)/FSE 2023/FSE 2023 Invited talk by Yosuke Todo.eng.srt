1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
Kobe it's my pleasure to introduce our

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,700
second invited speaker of this

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,720
conference yusuke Todo so yosuke is a

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,960
distinguished researcher at NTT

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,480
and before this he started here actually

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,500
in Kobe where he obtained in 2017 his

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,340
PhD from the Kobe University

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,619
during his PhD he invented the division

9
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,260
property that you have already also we

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,320
heard about it's a very powerful

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,460
technique to search for integral

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,040
distinguishers

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,380
um so this in particular this technique

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,320
permitted him to break the the cipher

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,559
block Cipher Misty one a very old and

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,239
well-known Cipher and break it was an

17
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,579
open problem for many years and this

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,879
work uh gave him the best paper award at

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,420
crypto 2015. so yosuki worked also in

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,160
other types of crypto analysis well he

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,260
has very very nice results published at

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,780
the best on the best conferences of our

23
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,159
domain is surely one of the most

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,439
brilliant and talented analysis of his

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,979
generation and so it's our pleasure to

26
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,619
have yes okay with us today that will

27
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,200
tell us a story behind the invention of

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,220
the division property

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,060
okay so thank you very much for

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,479
introduction so I'm yosuke Todo at the

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,780
NDT social informatics Laboratories so

32
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,759
first of all so that I would like to

33
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,700
thank a programming coaches and uh so

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,280
also the our editorial about the members

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,860
so thank you very much for inviting me

36
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,920
so that I'm very pleasured to give the

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,460
invited talk at this nice conference

38
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,759
so today I want to talk as a story

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,520
behind developing the division property

40
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,298
so the

41
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,159
it doesn't work

42
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,240
okay it works okay so the topic is about

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,079
division property

44
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,800
so the division property was initially

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,980
proposed euroclip 2015

46
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,020
and so this is a tool to find the

47
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,780
integral distinguishers regionally

48
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,000
so the

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,200
uh very soon after so at crypto 2050 so

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,459
this technique can be used to break the

51
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:33,360
mystery one

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,280
so I think it's um my fortune maybe so

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,379
uh this paper got the best paperwork

54
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,319
that crypto 2050 and many researchers

55
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,900
recognize these techniques and after

56
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,080
that many papers uh I don't know many

57
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,660
assets many researchers have focused on

58
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,420
these topics and uh published many many

59
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,099
follow-up works

60
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,459
so actually this is our last day so I

61
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,879
count the number of papers in the IH ISL

62
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,800
conference to the crypto eurocrypt Azure

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Crypt and FSC and I just count the

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,959
number of papers highly related to the

65
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,019
division property so I found almost a

66
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,360
set of papers so from the 2015 so one is

67
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,239
the foundations who have more mass

68
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,000
magical or something so there uh and

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,120
another one is

70
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,060
SMD based automatic Search tool and also

71
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,480
the extension to the cube attack and

72
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,239
sometimes those are like uh breaking the

73
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,959
Misty one so it uh gets a best key

74
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,180
recovery attack against some important

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,819
cell phones

76
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:49,799
so now here is FSC so I think uh many

77
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,959
nice symmetrical cryptographers joined

78
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,659
this conference so here so I want to

79
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,420
thank all the contributors for enhancing

80
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,340
the division property

81
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,940
so today so I don't talk the latest

82
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,260
results so just uh oh so uh Pastor I

83
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,599
only talked the past story so beginning

84
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,180
story uh so I developed the division

85
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,978
property so because I think as a I'm no

86
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,519
longer as a proper person who speaks uh

87
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,820
uh latest result maybe as a many many

88
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,080
researchers already know the latest

89
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,560
result so I think today I want to talk

90
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,580
uh the topic only I can talk

91
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,979
so this is a story from the 2012 to

92
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,380
2050.

93
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,139
but of course the before the talk so I

94
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,540
need to explain the brief introduction

95
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,060
of the division property so because uh

96
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,580
someone didn't doesn't know this

97
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,720
technique

98
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,419
okay so the topic is about integral

99
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,680
attack so also known as a square attack

100
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,020
so that so the target is uh AES so now

101
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,639
you know

102
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,680
uh as state

103
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,919
consists of 16 bytes so and with this

104
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,600
Matrix structures

105
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,000
so now we prepare the two to the eight

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,220
to the print text so that means this

107
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,800
lead byte xor value

108
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,759
and white byte is a constant

109
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,940
so now we apply sub byte of course uh

110
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,460
sub byte Xbox is the permutations

111
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,400
so this property can be preserved

112
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,759
and next apply the shift rules but uh so

113
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,979
faster low is the identity map so it's

114
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,539
exactly the same

115
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,199
and next mix comments so the big scrum

116
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,380
is a linear layer and this one byte

117
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,440
active uh goes to the four bytes acting

118
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,479
in this columns

119
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,600
so it means we focus on one by two with

120
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,419
the lead byte so it takes the whole

121
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,000
value from 0 to 0xff

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,880
and the white bytes are constant

123
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,539
okay this is a one round properties then

124
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,460
next two rounds

125
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,979
uh some bite is the same and the shift

126
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,740
row goes to the chance active positions

127
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,539
and mixed garments

128
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,600
we have this structure it means uh if we

129
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,259
pick one byte from the 16 bytes it takes

130
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,580
all value okay then next uh sub byte

131
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,979
shift row so that we keep the same

132
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,300
property

133
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,360
after that in the mixed garments

134
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,840
we no longer observe all properties but

135
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,860
uh mixed scrum is linear so the sum of

136
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,580
the value is zero so this property is

137
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,240
preserved and we score this property

138
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,100
balance property

139
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,639
and so now we get three round integral

140
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,919
Square distinguishers

141
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,100
so it's a powerful attack Tool uh

142
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,180
against AES and also we can extend this

143
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,979
attack with four rounds distinguishers

144
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,440
by using these methods higher of the

145
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,360
integral techniques

146
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,860
so we have focus on the this uh

147
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,500
diagonals and we activate the four bytes

148
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,300
at the same time so that we use the two

149
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,400
to the 32 chosen plain text

150
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,940
then uh one Lounge encryptions

151
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,699
we have these structures but this

152
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,479
structure means we have two to the 24

153
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,060
structures and each structure has this

154
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,900
form

155
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,620
so it as a result so we have a four

156
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,800
round integral distinguisher

157
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,960
so when I explain the division property

158
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,979
I sometimes use this right so uh a yes

159
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,560
maybe as a family consists the AES so

160
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,800
that we have integral property can get

161
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,319
the foreground integral distinguishers

162
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,520
but

163
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,220
we also have very similar results to the

164
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,319
degree estimations so when we estimate

165
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,979
the algebraic category then we have uh

166
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,280
some result but uh so

167
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,220
even if we use some nice uh so the upper

168
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,880
round of the degree estimations so that

169
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,800
we can't get the same result

170
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,139
so the usual area the integral property

171
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,240
is better than a degree estimation in

172
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,560
that case but okay so now we extend the

173
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,800
Xbox so originally AES box is the

174
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,680
algebraic category table but now so that

175
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,740
we modify the Xbox and we choose a very

176
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,200
weak Xbox whose legal is only algebraic

177
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,380
category three then uh what happens to

178
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,958
the in regular estimation we can get

179
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,140
more nice results than integral property

180
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,500
so at that case the good estimation is

181
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,480
better than integral property

182
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,459
so

183
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:54,779
uh

184
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,640
actually this is a very interesting

185
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,279
situation because uh now we have

186
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,160
integral attack and also uh higher the

187
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,959
differential attack comes from the

188
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,620
degree estimation so I think this both

189
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,680
attacks are the same because we fast

190
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,800
prepare the set of the chosen plain text

191
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,140
and computes the set of the ciphertext

192
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,779
and focus on the sum of this hyper text

193
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,200
and if this sum is zero or not so this

194
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,300
is a Distinction on the integral and the

195
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,660
higher the differential attack so these

196
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,060
two these two attacks has the same

197
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,860
interface but uh different result so

198
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,560
this is the main Motivation by division

199
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,260
property is important so

200
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,899
initially the my motivation is we take

201
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,240
the best of the two methods

202
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,820
so for example the integral property so

203
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,580
that in the s-box the permutation so if

204
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,279
input takes all value of course output

205
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,160
takes all value if the input is a

206
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,899
balanced property balance means the sum

207
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,779
of the this value to zero and so that

208
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:01,980
it's unknown

209
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,860
but the integral property overlook this

210
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,399
property so now Xbox is the degree D so

211
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,860
if we activate the D plus 1 bit active

212
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,260
then the output is advanced

213
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,080
because of the digital estimation

214
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,940
so but the integral properties

215
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,440
overlooked this amount so as a this is

216
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,240
the interesting point so that we want to

217
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,300
if we can use the degree RJ black

218
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,160
category at the same time with integral

219
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,240
property

220
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,459
there is the possibility we can improve

221
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,320
something

222
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,480
so this is the IDS of the division

223
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,560
property

224
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,160
originally X is a set of chosen brain

225
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,640
text and so the Y is the set of the

226
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,339
cipher text and we want to focus on the

227
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,820
sum of the white to the e i if that EI

228
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,940
is a unit Vector so if we focus on the

229
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,240
high speed of the cipher text so that we

230
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,360
want to know this value is 0 or not for

231
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,560
or key

232
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,940
but if we want to compute this

233
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,860
uh this distinct if we want to get this

234
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,019
distinguishers in experimentally for

235
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:10,920
example

236
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,019
it's a practically impossible because

237
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:16,140
the set of the X is too many and the

238
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,300
number of key is also too many so it's a

239
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,040
practically impossible

240
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,380
so now in the division property we

241
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,800
change the set of x to the set of the k

242
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,320
so that it's a Samsung basis

243
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,620
Transformations so originally this is a

244
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,740
set X but we use a set of the use such

245
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,360
that sum of the X to the U is non-zero

246
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,060
so

247
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,380
and

248
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,680
we also have the same property of the

249
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,459
set of the K of the ciphertext site and

250
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,120
uh if that you need to back the e i is

251
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,300
and we check the unit back the EI is

252
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,640
included in the kro not

253
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,040
if it's not included

254
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,100
so from the definitions we can say as a

255
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,399
sum of the e x to the e i is always zero

256
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,339
so we need all elements in y but there

257
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,700
are I think is that maybe originalized

258
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,620
from the left side so that we need all

259
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,720
elements in y

260
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,700
but of course there are too many

261
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,380
elements so it's a practically

262
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,740
impossible to compute it that's after

263
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,040
basis transformation from X to K so the

264
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,560
partial information because the KR is a

265
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,380
too many elements here includes too many

266
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,620
elements but only uh the focus is a unit

267
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,740
back that is included or not so these

268
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,540
are partial information so the KR is

269
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,660
enough so it's a one of the reason uh

270
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,040
the left side is a practically

271
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,579
impossible but light side is a possible

272
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:57,620
and so after that the uh

273
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,839
2016 FSE so I introduced the three

274
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,700
subset variant so that we use the

275
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,920
cassette LSAT like this

276
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,060
and the cassette is now the uh some of

277
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,160
the X to the U is the polynomial of the

278
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,339
key and LSAT is the sum of the X to the

279
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,120
U is equal to the one and so the we get

280
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,600
the same uh we get and the goal is the

281
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,519
same

282
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,980
okay so after proposal so we have

283
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,360
um so related Works about the edited so

284
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,540
I initially saw the

285
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,019
so K set is enough and maybe as a if we

286
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,540
use the lsats to the it's a bit

287
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,300
difficult to embody the propagations in

288
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,380
practice

289
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,839
and the cassette is a much simpler and

290
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,820
there's a it's a practically possible to

291
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,620
compute the propagation so I mainly

292
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,139
focused on the case set but so that if

293
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,880
there's a proposal and there are many

294
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,519
follow-up bugs and by using the mid tool

295
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,940
and nowaday LSAT propagation is more

296
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,060
common and we have a different name so

297
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,639
the one is a party set so it's a crypto

298
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,700
2060 so this is a very similar to the

299
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,480
asset and it provides a beneficial

300
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,500
mathematical View

301
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,740
and also Asia could be 2020 so the

302
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,959
monomial prediction so this also the

303
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,760
equivalent with the asset propagations

304
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,579
and monomial trade and monomial is a

305
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,560
propagation of the asset

306
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,440
so I think as a cassette and LSAT is a

307
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,899
meaningless but so it's so uh just the

308
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:39,779
alphabet so I think so this type of

309
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,120
terminology is a material reflected to

310
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,940
the meaning so direct wording so

311
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,820
using this type what is a better

312
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,600
okay so up to here so I so from from

313
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,380
here so I want to go back to that so 10

314
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,399
years ago so and let's that's uh uh main

315
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,760
story

316
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:10,680
okay so what was the first step

317
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,300
uh so 2012 so almost 10 years ago so I

318
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,800
joined the cementor kid research group

319
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,519
entity uh corporations

320
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,459
so in this group so there are three uh

321
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,920
symmetric cryptographers in our group so

322
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,380
one is a customer okay so that now he

323
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,199
stays he sit here so he is a subgroup

324
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,480
leader of our research group

325
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,180
and another passing is a kanyasuda so

326
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,699
that he is a probable security expert

327
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,459
and maybe as a last one is a very famous

328
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:45,660
researchers I use asaki so she is a

329
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,399
teacher for me

330
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,240
okay so when I entered this group so the

331
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm not so familiar with symmetric

332
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,399
crypto analysis actually because I don't

333
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,899
know the differential crypto analysis

334
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,820
linear crypto analysis of course

335
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,240
integral crypto analysis so the my

336
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,699
colleagues say okay so that you study

337
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,199
everything

338
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,579
so I experiment so my Approach is

339
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:12,600
experimentally verified the famous

340
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,000
crypto analysis to understand them very

341
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,399
well so okay so the I faster is the

342
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,260
differential crypto knowledge paper and

343
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,800
I I implement it and next okay so I so

344
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,959
look at the linear crypto knowledge

345
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,760
paper and implement it and like this

346
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,480
so

347
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,680
during this process so I I'm interested

348
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,259
in the I was interested in the integral

349
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,459
attack

350
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:41,399
so the my first experiment is like this

351
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,079
so face serve Cipher very uh easy to

352
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,620
understand so now I first implement the

353
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,339
faster Cipher with random Publications

354
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,519
so a function is generated at random and

355
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,100
we check the integral integral

356
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,160
distinguisher experimentally

357
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,160
so in the integral attack we use all

358
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,959
balance constant

359
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,380
so like this okay so so fast left branch

360
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,540
is a constant then what happens this

361
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,299
blue line is fixed to constant

362
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,240
and we activate the light Branch so we

363
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,919
take all value

364
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,559
in the light Branch then what happens so

365
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,880
like this

366
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,439
so this led line takes all values

367
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,100
so in the three round you can see

368
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,880
exclusive or with two old values what

369
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,559
happens so that is the same as the

370
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,260
integral Square tag on the AES

371
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,960
it's advanced

372
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,500
so as a result we get all round integral

373
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,720
distinguisher so it's a very simple and

374
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,539
but powerful and easy to understand so

375
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,520
maybe uh everyone understands this

376
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,240
attack

377
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,900
yeah so I first implement this

378
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,500
distinguished this Cipher and I

379
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,220
experimentally verified this

380
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,799
distinguisher

381
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,380
next forecast is a general right to face

382
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,360
this so uh

383
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,620
now we I change the structure of the

384
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,620
facilities to the general festival and

385
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,080
similarly to the face there

386
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,900
I experimental check integral

387
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,940
distinguition against generalized

388
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,360
question so now here's the CC shim in

389
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,360
the constant and only the most light

390
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,460
Branch takes the old value

391
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,500
okay we do the same

392
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
okay so this blue line is a constant so

393
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,240
it's a totally fixed

394
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,679
and

395
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,700
this red line is all values okay so

396
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,340
similarly it is the festival in the one

397
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,280
two or two one two three four around the

398
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,820
five rounds so we have uh X collectible

399
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,000
with two or values so what happened so

400
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,480
that this value becomes balanced

401
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,900
so this pass is a bit meaningless but

402
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,840
here okay so that we have six round one

403
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,179
two three four five six yes so we have

404
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:10,980
six down the integral distinguisher

405
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,580
using two to the b b means uh uh size of

406
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,220
the branch so to the beach shouldn't

407
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,580
play text

408
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,340
okay so then

409
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,039
now we want to extend this idea to

410
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,500
higher order integrals so that's

411
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,679
similarly to the higher order integral

412
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,480
attack on AES

413
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,360
so now we add two rounds to the

414
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,039
beginning of the integral six round

415
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,000
integral distinguishes and all goes to

416
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
like this so the uh the structure is c a

417
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,260
a

418
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,160
there's a a means if even if we

419
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,520
concatenate these three values it has

420
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,320
all property

421
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,580
so now uh if we have two three B chosen

422
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,760
print text so after two rounds we can

423
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,640
get two to the 2B set

424
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,360
where it's set to take c c c a so it's

425
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,039
the input of the six round integral

426
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,299
distributions

427
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:16,200
so after two plus six rounds the sum is

428
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,059
always zero

429
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,780
so as a result we get eight round

430
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,520
interval distinguishes by using two to

431
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,160
the 3B chosen vertex

432
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,500
so of course it's also simple and maybe

433
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,640
I you understand very well I think

434
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,860
okay so what

435
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,419
I did in there

436
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,620
so I think I prepare the facer and the

437
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,080
gfn with several parameters so that I

438
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,080
change the size of the bit of the F

439
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,460
functions and uh I change the

440
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,160
number of the branch and I check that

441
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,280
each integral distinguish experimentally

442
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,140
sometimes

443
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,640
I observed very strange distinguishes so

444
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,380
strength means

445
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,200
we I can't prove this distinguisher by

446
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,320
using integral property

447
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,840
so this is example

448
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,780
so now here is a type to generalize the

449
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,340
face there

450
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,160
but a function is

451
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,039
like this so notes uh so Random

452
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,520
permutations we fast apply two Xboxes in

453
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,660
parallel

454
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,460
and the linearlya is applied

455
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,179
so of course this is a kind this is a

456
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:39,120
one class of the Apostle generalized

457
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,080
Festival

458
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,140
so similarly to the uh London

459
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,520
permutation case

460
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,860
we have a six round integral

461
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,900
distinguishers by activating the last

462
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,860
branch

463
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,200
so of course it's the same

464
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,520
that's surprisingly

465
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,580
then the size of the Xbox is full we

466
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,260
observed the balance property in this

467
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,559
branch

468
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,360
and

469
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,720
pen the size of the size box is 5. we

470
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,039
can't observe a balance anymore

471
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,360
so this is uh faster questions uh for me

472
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,159
so from debate I developed the division

473
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,539
property

474
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,780
so originally I saw the integral

475
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,460
property is a very nice and very

476
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,280
powerful tool and everything I can prove

477
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,900
it better now

478
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,159
we have we had something strange one so

479
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,600
that we can't prove the integral

480
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,980
integral property

481
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,120
that this is a not new fund

482
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,220
and very interesting

483
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,620
so

484
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,559
I

485
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:55,200
surveyed several kinds of paper not only

486
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,900
English one but also Japanese one

487
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,679
I found very nice papers so this one

488
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,760
maybe you can't understand so uh it's a

489
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,640
ipanka faced the records on the whole in

490
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,559
Japanese so they just it's a saturation

491
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,480
capitalistics of General Electric faster

492
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,020
structure

493
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,960
is very famous researchers in Japan so

494
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,400
and he develops he analyzed several

495
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,039
kinds of the integral distinguishes

496
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:30,960
and in his Japanese article I found very

497
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,799
very similar property

498
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,280
so they showed a very related

499
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,380
conjectures and uh strange integral

500
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,020
distinguish on graphia so craft here was

501
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,820
selected the test of time available

502
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,460
yesterday

503
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,659
so

504
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:52,260
the product presents very nice integral

505
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,900
distinguisher very strange and so the

506
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,380
easy to not easy to verify integral

507
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,760
distinguishes

508
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,940
so assuming this conjecture hold

509
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,880
we can prove this strange Behavior so

510
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,539
what he did

511
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,880
so this is that's no conjecture

512
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,480
so he presents LK model

513
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,580
LK model is defined like this

514
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:27,539
is input and now so that this x is p so

515
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,580
this x i is applied to the balanced

516
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,980
function GI and balanced function is

517
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,840
defined like this

518
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,179
and compute the sum

519
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,640
and output is a y okay

520
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,679
so he defined this LK model and

521
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,940
in so not conjecture say if L is equal

522
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,440
to 2K

523
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,740
the number of appearance such that Y is

524
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,039
equal to B is equal to the number of

525
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:00,720
appearance the Y equals zero model 2.

526
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,500
and if air is less than 2K the number of

527
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,559
appearance Y is equal to B is equal to

528
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:11,100
zero motor 2. okay so what is what I say

529
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,940
so the this is the image here is a model

530
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,340
to all property so we call this property

531
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,799
model to all but sometimes we call this

532
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,080
property evil or old property in the

533
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,600
integral crypto analysis but uh so I

534
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,179
called this property model or in during

535
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:28,740
my research

536
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,159
so model to R is like this okay so now

537
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,799
this is a case of the error is four so

538
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,380
we focus on the number of appearance y

539
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,520
so the uh zero appear so the number of

540
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,299
appearance of zero is 30 and 50 50 21

541
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,039
blah blah blah

542
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,539
so

543
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,700
you notice

544
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,620
or case the number of appearance is Alt

545
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,559
so then if we compute the model to all

546
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,299
it's equivalent with all

547
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,600
and

548
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,880
um so if we apply the additional Xbox

549
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,140
here

550
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,840
so model to all property is perfectly

551
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,379
preserved

552
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,799
okay so now we debut as a type to

553
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,380
generalize the face there so the problem

554
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,960
that's not conjecture

555
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,419
so now ccca okay so now here is X1 X2

556
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,659
and she is y1 Y2

557
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:31,860
so

558
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,539
this

559
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,720
function is like this

560
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:43,740
S1 S2 L1 is F3 and S3 S4 L2 is f8

561
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,140
and that's what the y1 Y2 is computed

562
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,700
like this

563
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,120
but linear function can be decomposed

564
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,900
so we can rewrite this uh function like

565
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,140
this

566
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:00,900
so now so in my experiments we use 4B

567
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,020
test box and the number of the input is

568
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,919
a two so it means L is equal to 2K

569
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,720
so this this case

570
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:17,220
so we know y1 Y2 has a property model 2

571
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,520
or

572
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,580
so this pink line is a modulator and as

573
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,059
I say model 2 or can propagate through

574
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,039
the non-linear functions

575
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,700
so here at the motor tool and here all

576
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,980
property is excelled with modulator or

577
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,840
so now he is balanced

578
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,840
so Sanctus that's not conjecture

579
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,399
we can prove this property

580
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,740
but so I say it's a conjecture

581
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,900
so yes called This is a conjecture so

582
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,400
not supportive

583
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,460
because they in in his Japanese paper

584
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,400
they didn't prove educate model

585
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,059
they only prove whole K model

586
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:07,200
so if the size of the Xbox is a full

587
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,520
they provide proof so their proof is

588
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,919
enough to explain my small experiments

589
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,720
so because my small experiments use of

590
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,220
hobby test boxes

591
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,980
but not enough for crefia because you

592
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,220
know crafty I use 8-bit Xboxes

593
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,419
so

594
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,880
it did

595
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,580
several kinds of the many time many

596
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,220
experiments and that's the experimentary

597
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,240
shows a H4 model is built

598
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,640
but of course in general so there are no

599
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,799
proof about the LK model

600
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,900
so this is the conjecture

601
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,419
this is a fast step of the division

602
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,299
property so I've passed and noticed

603
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:54,179
these are conjectures so my first work

604
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,779
how to prove this conjecture

605
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:02,700
so I think so this proof is a personal

606
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,860
step of the division property

607
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,700
so of course so the Sonos conjecture is

608
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,640
very specialized structures so fast we

609
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,320
apply the balance function and the sum

610
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,659
and that's all so more complicated

611
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:17,340
functions

612
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,620
LV no longer apply it

613
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,760
but uh so so the this proof is not so

614
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,919
General like division property

615
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,559
but nowadays so that I leave you this

616
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,539
hurts notes conjectures then we wanted

617
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,659
to prove this conjectures by using the

618
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,899
division property it's trivial

619
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:40,219
okay so now

620
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,440
we want to understand we want to Beyond

621
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,419
that's not conjunctions okay so

622
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:46,980
originally

623
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,640
we have c c a a and this is by combining

624
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,220
higher order integral attack and that's

625
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,220
not property then we observe a balanced

626
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,440
property here so now all all and this is

627
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,120
one land this is a ccca then uh to know

628
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,059
the property we get balance here yep

629
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:08,899
however very interesting one so the

630
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:11,940
experimentary again I did this

631
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,200
experiment and uh as a result

632
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,820
if

633
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,020
this a function consists of four four

634
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,340
bit s boxes and linear layer

635
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,779
surprisingly we observed balance

636
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:30,779
property more one long

637
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,580
five

638
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,840
so unfortunately so that it's not in

639
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,539
it's not possible to prove this property

640
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:42,659
by using the two nodes property

641
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:47,100
so we need more uh so General

642
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,559
Theory to understand this phenomenon

643
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,600
so how to generalize to know the

644
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,320
property so this is my next step

645
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,679
so we expect the similar

646
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:03,059
phenomenon's property in more

647
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,860
complicated functions so that's not

648
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,020
property only focus on the balance

649
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,679
function the sum but maybe we have more

650
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:12,840
complicated case

651
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,080
and uh maybe rehab is a similar result

652
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,100
but we don't know so my Approach maybe

653
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,260
understanding model 2 or is very

654
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,820
important

655
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,279
but unfortunately the face there is too

656
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,600
complicated so that it's uh so uh not

657
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,159
unlike SPN so the input print data comes

658
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:39,480
from the uh uh so this Branch comes from

659
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,880
the identity like and as it's very

660
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,460
complicated to understand the property

661
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,500
of the festival so

662
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,919
let's go to the SPL okay so we faster so

663
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,020
the gifs are faced it and we next go to

664
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,539
the SPN because SPN is much simpler and

665
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:55,740
that to understand

666
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,279
yeah so this is my next experiment on

667
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,880
the SP and structure so whole phobit

668
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,440
Xboxes and then linear layer

669
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,039
okay so my experiments fast so we have

670
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,919
this one two three branch takes all

671
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,419
values so we use the two to the

672
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:22,140
uh 12 chosen predicts so 4 8 12. and the

673
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,360
last branch is fixed constant

674
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,720
so if we use the integral property only

675
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,460
then

676
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,799
uh the distinguisher is up to two round

677
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,240
always

678
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,299
independent of the Xbox and linear layer

679
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,940
but of course there's a yeah so there is

680
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,080
the possibility of the higher the

681
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,279
differential attack

682
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:46,799
but if we only use the integral property

683
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,659
aptitude log

684
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:50,539
that's also the

685
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:54,899
experimentally I observed three round

686
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:57,720
integral distinguishes and very

687
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,940
interesting one is the one land before

688
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,700
of the three rounds so the two round

689
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,080
output takes model to all

690
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,020
so

691
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,600
I think uh okay so the SPN is also

692
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,120
interesting so I try to

693
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,880
several kinds of things experimentals

694
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,539
for the SPN so I Define and add model so

695
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:25,860
that it's use n edit Xboxes

696
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,779
and

697
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,480
repeats the number brand and I

698
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,399
experimentally check how many number

699
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,539
brands distribution

700
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,880
so this is the case then we use 4-bit

701
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,620
Xboxes

702
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,980
so n is the number of Xboxes in one

703
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,620
round and active it means the number of

704
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,140
active Xboxes

705
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,200
so up to here so that it's a two round

706
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,539
integral distinguisher so it's exactly

707
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,460
the same as the integral propagation of

708
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,100
the integral property but from here so

709
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,320
we observe something strange property in

710
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,019
the context of integral property

711
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,540
so here we observously down the integral

712
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,300
distinguishes and moreover if we have

713
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,500
six Xboxes six four bits boxes

714
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,719
we have four round integral

715
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,319
distinguisher

716
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,440
so

717
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,599
I initially thought

718
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,119
oh it's very nice result

719
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:35,099
because I only know integral property I

720
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,960
didn't know the higher order

721
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,820
differential attack so far I did this

722
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,379
research

723
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:43,020
so oh three round integral distinguisher

724
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,580
it's pretty nice

725
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,399
because I thought it's a non-poliberal

726
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,800
distinguisher but very soon my

727
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,639
colleagues say ah you overlook the

728
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,800
ugly estimations higher the differential

729
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,000
attack

730
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,260
so I was super surprised so because I

731
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,700
didn't know that Iota differential

732
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,320
attack so it's up here I did this

733
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,900
research and so the island is higher the

734
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,660
differential papers and so I

735
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,780
at that time I understand what is

736
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,640
algebra activity

737
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,000
algebraic normal form so before that I

738
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,579
didn't know about uh degree and the

739
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,339
Boolean functions anymore

740
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:26,160
so but

741
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,640
I fast at least that

742
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,520
essential social media so first paper

743
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,020
but the higher the differential attack

744
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,480
so I didn't know the advanced method to

745
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,460
estimate algebraically

746
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,980
so I first think ah okay but it's a no

747
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,560
problem because we observe four round

748
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,540
integral distinguisher too

749
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,820
so they don't distinguish here yes we

750
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,859
can prove it by using the degree

751
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:51,960
estimations so simple the algebra

752
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,440
category bound but uh fall round

753
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,900
so three times three times three is just

754
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,260
27 uh but it's a larger than 20. okay no

755
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,760
problem because four round integral

756
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,660
distinguishes new

757
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,320
but

758
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,619
it's my mistake because I didn't know

759
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:15,119
this nice paper FSC 2011 so that we have

760
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,520
a nice house of the upper bound papers

761
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,500
of the algebraic category for the Spain

762
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,640
structure so if we use this technique

763
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,680
we can prove our fall on the integral

764
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,099
distinguishers but we at that time I

765
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:32,040
haven't I hadn't recognized it

766
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,420
so

767
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,099
I want to prove my method

768
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,720
so

769
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,599
my view com always comes from the

770
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,579
integral property so integral property

771
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,680
like analysis

772
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,440
so now here is the SP instructions of

773
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,079
the old or constant okay so after one

774
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,320
launched

775
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,359
I don't know and so the next one land

776
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,078
model

777
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,280
one question is so the previous integral

778
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,820
property we have many a

779
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:17,640
is a here is a here is a everything is a

780
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,960
so it's super complicated so we have

781
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,060
many a but uh

782
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,480
each a is a different property I think

783
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,540
so the question is how to distinguish

784
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,060
these different kinds of the air

785
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,940
so now let's understand

786
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,400
what is a model to all

787
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,859
so now here is our property your

788
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:45,480
property is very nice so that because

789
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,359
they are very beautiful to the from the

790
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:52,140
0 to F so that it appears only at once

791
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,320
now so that we use higher order integral

792
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,619
it's a one branch of the a so then it's

793
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,540
also beautiful so the the number of

794
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,440
appearance to zero is a 16 and the 60s

795
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,640
so it's very beautiful

796
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,200
but in model 2 or not so like this

797
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,000
so yeah so if okay so if we say oh

798
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,940
property but everything is different

799
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,880
it's all it's all it's all but uh it's

800
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,859
different property so we need to

801
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:25,700
distinguish them

802
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,760
so model 2 or is very similar to a or a

803
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,400
a so this property is preserved even for

804
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,380
permutation supplied

805
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,220
but different how to distinguish it so

806
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,040
this is the next step so my Approach is

807
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,720
like this

808
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,720
so first

809
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,300
originally so that we focus on the this

810
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,440
Branch 4-bit values so now we have

811
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,900
additional one bit from the different

812
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,599
branch and we take the number of

813
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,540
frequencies of the five bit value not

814
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,980
4-bit

815
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,780
then this nice uh or or property then we

816
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,300
again observe nice property

817
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,480
0 appears eight times and uh so now we

818
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,460
have additional one bit from the top

819
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,820
Branch so we have one F so the number of

820
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,980
appearance of one f is also eight so

821
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,480
it's very beautiful

822
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,180
but in model 2 or is not solve

823
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,780
if we you if we involve additional one

824
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,420
bit from the top and in total we focus

825
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,720
on the fiber bit then

826
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,820
it's not we no longer observe a model to

827
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,560
all

828
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,579
okay so from this uh so observation so

829
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,359
that we need to change our salt

830
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:46,560
originally so that in the integral

831
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,339
property we focus on the property of

832
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:51,780
each branch

833
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,060
so we focus on this branch and this

834
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,640
branch is all balance to a constant or

835
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,160
even or modulator

836
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,060
but it's not enough so instead

837
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,480
my focus is by what side do we keep the

838
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,020
motor tool

839
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,960
so this is a experimental result on the

840
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,859
SPN in the context of the model tool

841
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:21,300
so now here is it here is or or or and

842
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,480
here the CAA means so we use the 2 to

843
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,440
the eight input so in total to the 23

844
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,099
input videos

845
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,740
okay so now we extract 23 bit from the

846
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,599
bottom

847
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,560
it's a model to all model it's all

848
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,880
exactly all

849
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,700
okay so now we apply one round what

850
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,960
happens

851
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,520
as a result up to 25 bit extraction it

852
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,180
has multiple but if we extract 22-bit we

853
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,339
no longer Observer model tool

854
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:58,380
and similarly

855
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,980
50-bit extraction model to all hybrid

856
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,079
extraction model 2 or

857
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,960
a bit extraction model tool

858
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,020
and to beat the extraction model to arm

859
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,460
is equal to the balanced

860
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:18,240
so from now we first build we first

861
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,240
think about the algebraic structure okay

862
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,660
so now we have cabinet extraction hot

863
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,119
model 2 or in the input and we are price

864
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,140
of plant body uh function f vectoral

865
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,260
Boolean function f and now here is

866
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,720
algebraic number of home

867
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,940
the question is how many bits of

868
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,040
extraction do we have a model to or in

869
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,460
the output

870
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,460
so now here is an algebraic normal form

871
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,800
and also we want to focus on the sum of

872
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,700
the X over the f x and Theta like this

873
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,079
and

874
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,660
so we can change the positions and uh

875
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:01,140
this part this part is a fixed so we

876
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,760
can't control anything because it's

877
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,640
defined by the fabulary function f and

878
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,079
this part so the input set only affects

879
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,220
to distance

880
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,579
so maybe this term is very important

881
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:17,640
and ah okay so then

882
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,820
we now combat the model to orders uh

883
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,280
some of the exits the U by using this

884
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,480
method

885
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,000
okay so now this is a 4-bit value and

886
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,579
the model 2 all in four bit value

887
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:32,640
so the sum of the X to the zero XF is

888
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,560
equal to the number of appearance of the

889
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,339
f

890
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:38,220
so it's a 15 yes

891
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,900
okay so now

892
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,780
we focus on the number but PR no x to

893
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,420
the the sum of the X to the e

894
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,800
but this is equal to the sum of the

895
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,619
number of appearance of E and F

896
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:56,660
but now this is a model tool

897
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:01,920
plus alt is of course even

898
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,400
so zero is the sum of the X to the E is

899
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,740
0 motor 2. what

900
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,380
okay comes

901
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,560
okay

902
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:22,140
and uh zero XD again is a zero model 2.

903
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,859
C is a sum of the four values and it's

904
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:28,560
of course model to zero and she said

905
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,740
that I didn't use uh I don't need to use

906
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,900
this property in the division property

907
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,180
but in fact this is a zero model

908
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,460
and model 200 model to zero and the

909
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,800
model for zero and so

910
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,920
so as that is that if the set X has a

911
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,839
model to all

912
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:51,839
info bit value at the sum of the X to

913
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,859
the U is always equal to zero for any U

914
00:43:55,859 --> 00:44:00,200
is less than 0x f

915
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,680
so by using this view so that we can

916
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,640
distinguish all or and model

917
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,880
so originally this is all all but so

918
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,700
that this is now we want to understand

919
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,980
this property

920
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,520
so the sum of the X to the U is equal to

921
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,599
zero who all U is less than 0x FF

922
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:27,839
but model to R is defined the sum of the

923
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,380
X2 U is equal to zero four U is less

924
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,619
than 0 x 0 f over U is less than zerox

925
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:36,060
F7

926
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,400
otherwise there is a possibility the sum

927
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,380
of the X's that you can be non-zero

928
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,640
so from here so we can come up with the

929
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,980
division properties so the idea is to

930
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,280
divide the set of U into two subset

931
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,160
one is the set of you such as the sum of

932
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,560
the X to the U is equal to zero and

933
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,720
another is the set of the users that's

934
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,839
the sum of the X to the U is non-zero so

935
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,560
can be independent

936
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,079
so the name of a division property comes

937
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,180
from this idea so we have originally the

938
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,579
set of U and we want to divide the set

939
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,980
of U into two cases

940
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:22,140
and also another important reason is D

941
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,060
is missing

942
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,359
so I originally think into from the I

943
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,280
always think about the integral property

944
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,240
or property a balance property B

945
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,500
constant property C even property e okay

946
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,540
oh D is missing

947
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,579
so this is the main reason so that I've

948
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:43,920
actually is the impact in there so I'm

949
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,380
looking for the good name from the

950
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,540
initial alphabet into d so I use the D

951
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,319
okay so now we want to focus on the low

952
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,319
degree function so the of course so that

953
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,660
I now so that you find the division

954
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,880
property but I need to

955
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,200
get some propagations uh something so

956
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,599
now if the degree of the function is D

957
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,960
so what we can say so now uh the sum of

958
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,420
the X2 j u can be non-zero friends the

959
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,460
weight of the U is coming weight of the

960
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,380
U is larger than k

961
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,960
then if this function is algebra

962
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,720
category D the sum of the white is the U

963
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,880
Can Be non-zero and the weight of U is

964
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,880
larger than K over B so we can prove

965
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,220
result by using the conversion the

966
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,800
algebraic number form and so that it's a

967
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,900
possibility for a bit

968
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,240
oh okay it's uh this idea is very nice

969
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,060
because we can successfully handle the

970
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,920
low degree function

971
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,560
and of course so there we need to embody

972
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,020
as a propagations

973
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,060
so

974
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,520
this is the idea so the originally we

975
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,520
have the division property fff0 then

976
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,740
what happens with the Xbox but it's Xbox

977
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,400
permutation then FFF zero so that after

978
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,160
the Xbox and the Indian layers the

979
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,839
everything is a mix

980
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:09,000
that's the harming weight is must be

981
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,400
preserved so 12 so the sum of the human

982
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,579
you to use the u4 must be larger than 12

983
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:17,520
so if the sum of the X to the U Can Be

984
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,720
non-zero

985
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,480
so for example we simply assign okay

986
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,260
7777 is that just as example then after

987
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,200
Xbox one one one one and it's a seven

988
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,480
one zero zero and this is one one one

989
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,140
one one one zero zero but it's a two

990
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,380
of course it's uh this is just one play

991
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,260
so we need to constell all kinds of the

992
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,260
trade and if there is no trade from the

993
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,079
beginning to the end as in the uh this

994
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,960
uh it becomes a unit vector

995
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,339
we can prove the integral distribution

996
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:55,920
Okay so

997
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,420
okay I skipped this right

998
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:04,560
uh so very sadness for me

999
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,079
uh so actually

1000
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:10,980
then I developed this tool up to here I

1001
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:13,980
didn't recognize this paper I'm sorry

1002
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,460
for them so

1003
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,300
I so fast I

1004
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,380
a very nice PCC pants and uh so oh

1005
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,380
I checked the my results and I compare

1006
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,040
the result with SPN Cipher almost the

1007
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,540
same lizard

1008
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,240
yeah so of course the Xbox the first

1009
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,000
layer so we use Xbox and we have stripes

1010
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,940
pretty straight difference but uh almost

1011
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,640
the same and uh actually the conversion

1012
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,060
from the this bound to the uh integral

1013
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,300
integral analysis and uh it's a it's a

1014
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,819
trip here so maybe uh by using this

1015
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:56,640
bound it's a possible to Pro to get the

1016
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,060
same result

1017
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:02,760
so however I couldn't give up of course

1018
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,220
so I you I always use them very much

1019
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:09,000
time so almost one year or two years

1020
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,540
I can't give up that of course uh I

1021
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,319
thought uh so this idea comes from the

1022
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,119
algebra record degree but my idea comes

1023
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:19,740
from the integral property so something

1024
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:24,000
different ah maybe I can give I can have

1025
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,460
different results or other kinds of the

1026
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,700
Sci-Fi so I can focus on the face there

1027
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,260
so it's a non-trivial to apply the

1028
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,359
degree estimations for the SPN to the

1029
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:38,099
FSA is the non-trivial but the division

1030
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:40,980
property can be possible and fortunately

1031
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,980
that I have um so defined result

1032
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,140
and also the as

1033
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,800
so linear layer is perfect is the fully

1034
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,140
mixed so then there is no difference

1035
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,680
with the BCC pounds but if we use

1036
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,260
shifter laws and the mix chromas so the

1037
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,740
linear layer is defined uh not the

1038
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,740
diffusion one then we have a different

1039
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,140
result

1040
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,319
anyway this is our original question

1041
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,300
so

1042
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,180
initially this is the question so now to

1043
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,060
know the property can't believe this so

1044
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,420
the question is division property proved

1045
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,640
is property or not this distinguish or

1046
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,540
not so as so we can prove it

1047
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,319
so not so good picture so this is the

1048
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,000
initial division property with Hamming

1049
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,160
weight and there is a trailer from the

1050
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,980
he this weighted too it's possible and

1051
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,500
one line is also possible battle from

1052
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,700
one to here to here so there is no trade

1053
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,579
so it's impossible to input properties

1054
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:49,200
here and the output property here so

1055
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,059
that's an impossibility from here to

1056
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:53,940
propagate to here so we say the sum of

1057
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,579
the wiser to the U is equal to zero when

1058
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:59,880
the humming rate of U is one

1059
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,700
okay so the

1060
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:06,599
uh in seven one eight minutes I think so

1061
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,400
the quickly

1062
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,319
like also the story behind breaking

1063
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,780
Misty one

1064
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,180
okay so after proposal of the my

1065
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,520
eurocrypted paper so I'm I uh no no

1066
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,559
after submitting to the euro crypto

1067
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:20,460
papers

1068
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,400
not uh so to accept before acceptance

1069
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,280
I was looking for more attractive

1070
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,960
targets

1071
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,660
so

1072
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,819
so the originally the division property

1073
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:35,040
is applied to the general structure SPN

1074
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,000
Festival but uh so only this maybe a not

1075
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,240
so good so I think it's maybe I want to

1076
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,520
break someone nicer Cipher

1077
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,460
by using this uh new techniques

1078
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,819
and what this target is better one is

1079
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:52,440
low degree this box

1080
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,440
because if the degree of the Xbox is

1081
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,339
high

1082
00:51:56,339 --> 00:51:58,319
integral crypto analysis integral

1083
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,700
property is nice

1084
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,099
and another one is a no full diffusion

1085
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:04,200
linear layer is good because if as a

1086
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,880
linear layer is a very sort of

1087
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,339
complicated and mixed everything

1088
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:10,920
then BCC pounds is the same

1089
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,800
and another it's we want to avoid two

1090
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,079
complicated linear layer so it's a

1091
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,099
contradict to the second condition so

1092
00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:22,319
linear layer is

1093
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:27,059
simple is better but to Simply is not

1094
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:29,460
good but too complicated it's not so

1095
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,640
good so something so so is a better

1096
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,440
otherwise we can't embody the

1097
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,359
propagation in Practical time

1098
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:39,900
and we must Cipher it's of course very

1099
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,800
important

1100
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,020
and if possible I want to break the full

1101
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,260
specification okay so yes I found nice

1102
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,780
targets it's a misty one

1103
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,720
so because Misty one has 9B test box and

1104
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,900
7B test box but this algebra category is

1105
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:59,359
only two or three it's too small

1106
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:03,260
linear layer is complicated

1107
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,079
I'm not sure so that it depends on value

1108
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,839
so for me

1109
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,700
still possible

1110
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,059
and so famous

1111
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:17,480
at least so the what Japanese instrument

1112
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,020
cryptographic Community super famous

1113
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,640
is a hero

1114
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,460
so if possible I want to break the full

1115
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,000
specification

1116
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,839
so now I want to debut the previous

1117
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,780
existing attack against Misty one but I

1118
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,859
said I don't want to explain everything

1119
00:53:37,859 --> 00:53:40,619
because the time is limited that's uh

1120
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:43,859
one nice thing is here so the before the

1121
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:45,660
division property

1122
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:49,859
we can attack seven rounds with 5 f l

1123
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:53,099
good specification is eight round with 5

1124
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:54,240
FL

1125
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,880
security margin is only one round oh

1126
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,520
it's a possible it could be possible so

1127
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,559
I just try so then

1128
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:04,380
I've successfully found a new integral

1129
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,599
distinguishers covering sixth round

1130
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:09,540
original one is only four rounds so that

1131
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,940
we can improve at two round

1132
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,040
we can improve the number of rounds of

1133
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,900
the integral distinguisher by two rounds

1134
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,819
okay so the two Randy probe is enough

1135
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:22,260
because one round it covers it could be

1136
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,740
possible

1137
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,280
uh so after

1138
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,400
I found this attack so that I talk with

1139
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,440
the magician at the

1140
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,020
Japanese domestic conference

1141
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,780
so and so that I say ah I break the

1142
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,780
Misty van so she said oh

1143
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,319
which which attack so I said ah so

1144
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,359
something higher the differential okay

1145
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:51,660
okay so this is just a story so that I

1146
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,180
discussed with medicine but after that

1147
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,579
after getting the best paper award at

1148
00:54:56,579 --> 00:54:59,460
crypto 2050 so I received the one made

1149
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,400
from the magician so she said

1150
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,000
congratulations for breaking my Cipher

1151
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,339
congratulations for getting best paper

1152
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:10,260
what

1153
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,760
I

1154
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,940
want to get best Target about

1155
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,140
so this is a massive

1156
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,300
okay so I want to conclude my talk sorry

1157
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,420
the time is limited step was my first

1158
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,359
step was just experiment

1159
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,520
but the division property comes from my

1160
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,859
ad hoc analysis and I should have

1161
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:34,440
surveys better so the one something I

1162
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,160
should

1163
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,579
have surveyed existing works seriously

1164
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:39,900
in advance

1165
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,960
so at least it was heartbreaking to find

1166
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,760
out right here so so

1167
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,359
in case I can't find any differences

1168
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,359
with the BCC pumps it's a very sad thing

1169
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:57,059
for me but unfortunately so that it's a

1170
00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:00,000
no problem but uh yeah so

1171
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,720
I should have something in advance

1172
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,119
but uh I think it maybe it's a good drug

1173
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:09,300
but uh going on my way might cause a

1174
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,540
good result okay so thank you very much

1175
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:15,440
listening to my talk so question

1176
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:22,079
well thank you very much for the very

1177
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,480
nice talk uh so probably we can ask if

1178
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,660
there are some questions from Beijing

1179
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,319
first

1180
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,740
then any questions from Kobe

1181
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:50,040
so thanks for the very interesting and

1182
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,280
yeah inspiring talk so because of that

1183
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,800
is my yeah one of my super well my

1184
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,160
supervisors oh yeah my maybe it's my

1185
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,140
responsibility to ask something about

1186
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,220
those

1187
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:06,480
so yeah yeah so you did you have did you

1188
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,000
receive any Leaf uh

1189
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,099
response from that no sign in regarding

1190
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:14,900
their invention of the division property

1191
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,760
yeah so because I didn't explain it

1192
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,319
before so so maybe as a link visits not

1193
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:25,200
property so that I explained this link

1194
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,619
uh here at first time so maybe it's no

1195
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:31,099
sense didn't recognize it

1196
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:34,980
and this is a very bad thing is but sad

1197
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,319
I don't know City but writing user

1198
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:39,720
better so I can't cite

1199
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,359
so those papers because it's a Japanese

1200
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:44,420
so he campsite

1201
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,339
submitting the Euro clip I can't cite

1202
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:51,059
this Japanese papers say it's a so maybe

1203
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:55,440
uh he didn't didn't recognize it yeah in

1204
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,460
Japanese Community yeah yeah we many

1205
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,839
yeah many researchers are focusing on

1206
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:03,000
the integral crypto analysis and

1207
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,460
targeting trying to break the Misty one

1208
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:07,500
because yeah as you mentioned it it's

1209
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,359
it's a primary target in Japanese

1210
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,640
community so yeah it's quite

1211
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,259
understandable and yeah

1212
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,579
yeah yeah he should be very yeah happy

1213
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:23,160
to hear yeah your Invasion and the

1214
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,700
successful story yeah okay thank you

1215
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,619
very much

1216
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:32,059
are there any other questions

1217
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,000
Kobe or Beijing

1218
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,280
ask one question

1219
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,319
so

1220
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,319
so thanks for your interest in talk

1221
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,359
indeed I always want to know how you

1222
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,760
invented the the important flip and now

1223
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,000
you give the answers here so it's very

1224
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,720
I'm very glad to be here yeah so one

1225
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,319
question is that in my imagination I

1226
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,180
always thought for your Divine

1227
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:03,859
probability whether there is indeed some

1228
00:59:03,859 --> 00:59:07,920
inner structure for example you choose a

1229
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,220
large uh plain test set I mean only one

1230
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,680
bit is for example only one bit is

1231
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,260
constant and then the propagate the

1232
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,079
probability of this set what I thought

1233
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:22,619
is just like the integral attack on 400

1234
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:25,559
is so indeed the foreland attack is

1235
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:27,960
based on a three round attack so it is

1236
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,420
in the inner structure in the SRI Rand

1237
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,599
attack so is it possible for your attack

1238
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,480
indeed there are some

1239
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,319
similar structure I mean for some uh

1240
00:59:39,319 --> 00:59:42,119
intermediate around there are only one

1241
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:43,859
bit some cancer and then we propagate

1242
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:49,140
backwards uh some then we get this set

1243
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,059
so

1244
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:52,680
in my

1245
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,020
so the end so in the context of the

1246
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:58,260
integral attack so the as my view is

1247
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,319
different so the original thing original

1248
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:04,260
idea is that the first has inner

1249
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:08,040
distinguishes and it extends to the this

1250
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,299
side but it means so the in my view so

1251
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:14,760
that now we have the input initial in

1252
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:19,079
this initial structures at the analysis

1253
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:20,819
of this side and this side is

1254
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:22,319
independent

1255
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:25,859
better maybe so I think

1256
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:29,160
in the results are not analyzing

1257
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,720
independently

1258
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,880
so the analyzing the same triggers is

1259
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,020
much better

1260
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,839
so My Views so the

1261
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:39,240
yeah so and actually it's the same I

1262
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,220
developed the division property and this

1263
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,460
is the main question is the storage

1264
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:46,260
property when we use higher order

1265
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:49,200
integral and but the higher the integral

1266
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,960
comes from the uh so the inner

1267
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,599
distinguishes and extend to the project

1268
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:58,079
side but if we use it so we can't

1269
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,599
observe nice property then

1270
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:02,339
maybe it's something we actually

1271
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:04,740
something a nice properties you know if

1272
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:09,420
we consider the top from the top to the

1273
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,160
bottom at the same time

1274
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:16,140
so I think maybe as a uh analysis

1275
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,780
uh from the beginning to the end at the

1276
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,640
same time it's better so but this is

1277
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,240
just my view

1278
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,520
thank you

1279
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:30,319
maybe very last question someone

1280
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:38,700
so I have a small question so

1281
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,740
um if I be interested you know now wants

1282
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:43,680
to work on the division property uh what

1283
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,079
you suggest him like to look on what do

1284
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,760
you think are the challenges that are in

1285
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,480
Maine

1286
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,180
for this kind of attacks

1287
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,880
like a more algorithmic aspects like a

1288
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,420
look at the milk models or if there are

1289
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,099
some of magical things to do I don't

1290
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:00,420
know

1291
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:05,400
also division properties it's uh so

1292
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:05,880
um

1293
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,010
[Music]

1294
01:02:11,819 --> 01:02:16,680
so I think maybe so the effects of the

1295
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:20,520
students do now so I think one

1296
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,640
open question is something a milk model

1297
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:27,599
maybe so because uh

1298
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:32,040
so the LSAT so party set propagations so

1299
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,920
it's a practice so not so practical so

1300
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,440
that it's a still fish it's a something

1301
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,780
feasible but the application is very

1302
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:43,799
limited and this is a maybe we need some

1303
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:47,700
new techniques or what you found so

1304
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:51,660
they've uh we want to find much

1305
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,000
if you want to get the Practical

1306
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,579
algorithm to evaluate it so I think this

1307
01:02:56,579 --> 01:03:01,440
is a one good uh open questions

1308
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,420
thanks

1309
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:06,420
so we can thank again yosuke for his

1310
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:09,079
very nice talk

1311
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,520
and can have the coffee break
