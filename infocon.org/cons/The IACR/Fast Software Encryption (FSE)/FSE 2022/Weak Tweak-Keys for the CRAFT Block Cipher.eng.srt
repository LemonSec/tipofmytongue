00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,840
hi everyone i'm shahram la suzader from

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,080
ghatbad university of namhan in the

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,359
netherlands

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,280
and in this video i'm going to talk

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,040
about our paper

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,120
named weak tweak keys for the craft

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,799
block cipher

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,119
this work is done together with my phd

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,600
supervisor grigor landa

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,520
from george university of bochum in

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,000
germany

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,640
first i will talk about the craft block

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,000
cipher itself how it is designed how and

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,880
how it works

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,440
the cipher was designed by our group in

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,040
bochum and was and we presented at fsc

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,120
2019

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,039
the main motivation and the goal to

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,920
design this new cipher was to present in

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,600
cypher which is which to be efficient

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
while it is implemented together with

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,280
fault detection or fault the correction

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,120
countermeasures

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,840
however there were other secondary goals

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,680
we wanted the cipher to support

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,799
decryption on top of encryption while

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,880
with a small overhead

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,680
also we wanted to be a two equal block

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,640
cipher and be lightweight as much as

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,119
possible

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,159
we came up with the craft block cipher

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,479
which its name is crafted from this

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,040
phrase efficient protection against

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,680
fault attacks

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,640
its block and tweak sizes both are 64

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
bits and the key size

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,040
is 128 bits about its security

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,320
we claimed 120 bit security level in the

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,600
related tweak model

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,439
its general structure is a substitution

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,200
permutation network

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,840
it has 32 rounds that the first 31

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,640
rounds up to key and constant additions

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,320
are identical

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,880
the last round is all linear and does

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,759
not add any security to the cipher

47
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,560
its reason for being there is to make it

48
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,639
possible to have the same structure for

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,560
decryption as the one for encryption

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,440
it's in the internal state of the cipher

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,640
is shown by by a four times four matrix

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,840
of nibbles and its

53
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,239
overall structure is very similar to the

54
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,360
one in iskini and midori block ciphers

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,599
but there is a big difference here and

56
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,720
that is all the round operations used in

57
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,360
craft are involutive

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,800
inflative operations

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,640
in more details

60
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,720
there are five operations in each round

61
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
starting with an input state shown by

62
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
this figure

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,440
the first operation is mixed columns

64
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,920
which is a which a binary matrix is

65
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,840
multiplied to each column

66
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,319
then there is at round constants that

67
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,200
only a 4-bit and distribute values are

68
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,599
exhorted to the fifth

69
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,959
fourth and fifth nibbles of the state

70
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,400
it follows by

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,120
an adron toy key which depending on the

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
round index

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,680
one of the four tweaks is exert to

74
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,319
all of the state

75
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,040
the fourth new of the fourth operation

76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,519
is permeate nibbles that using a

77
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,200
permutation p

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,599
changes the position of the nipples in

79
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,440
the state

80
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,080
the last and the only gender

81
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,879
and the only nonlinear operation

82
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,840
is the sub box layer that an inflative

83
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,519
s-box is applied to each of the nipples

84
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,959
note that in the last round only only

85
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,519
this the first three operations are

86
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,159
included

87
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,680
about the tweaky schedule it's a tweaky

88
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,239
iterating one it builds four to eight

89
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,319
keys and depending on the reminder of

90
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,840
the round index to four uses one of them

91
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,840
precisely it splits the 128 bit key into

92
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,560
two 64-bit keys k0 and k1 k0 will be

93
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,040
used in the rounds with an even index

94
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,478
and k1

95
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,280
in the rounds with an odd index

96
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,560
by ignoring the tweak itself to each of

97
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,000
these keys the first two three keys are

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,199
produced

99
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,479
then by using a succulent permutation q

100
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,280
it changes the position of tweak nibbles

101
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,160
and by exhausting this modified tweak to

102
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,880
each of the keys it computes two other

103
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,600
tweaks

104
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,840
all together this structure of craft

105
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
makes it possible that the decryption

106
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,160
with the cipher to be as same as the

107
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,320
encryption up to a multiplication under

108
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,680
three keys

109
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
and the round constants

110
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,600
it just needs to reverse

111
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,080
the order of round constants and also

112
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
multiply the two equals with this

113
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,119
equation shown here

114
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,479
now we explain how to get the victory

115
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,280
key structure of the craft cipher we

116
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,000
started by explaining two properties of

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,360
its round operations

118
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,199
the first one is about the mixed columns

119
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,400
operation in the mixed columns operation

120
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,400
for the js column of the state

121
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,680
for the js column of the state we have

122
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,320
this equation

123
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,720
it means that only a linear

124
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
combination of the second and third

125
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,000
neighbors

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,639
is exert to the zeros and first

127
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,120
neighbors

128
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,560
extending this to all of the columns and

129
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,840
the state

130
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,720
one

131
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,520
and considering x prime as the upper

132
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,720
half of the input state and x double

133
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,360
prime as the bottom half

134
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
in the output of the mixed columns

135
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,800
operations

136
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
operation

137
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,199
x double prime stays unchanged and a

138
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,600
linear mapping of x double prime is

139
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,479
exact to x prime

140
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,000
we showed this

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,080
linear mapping on example prime by mxpr

142
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,880
mc prime

143
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,000
the second property is about the permit

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,919
nibbles operation

145
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,560
as previously shown in this operation

146
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,360
upper half of the state in the input

147
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,319
goes to the bottom half in the output

148
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,560
and the bottom half in the input goes to

149
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,680
the upper half in the output

150
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,319
we separate this operation to p n prime

151
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,639
mp and double prime

152
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
and since pn itself is an evolutive

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,520
operation it makes that pn double prime

154
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,599
to be inverse of the pn prime

155
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,280
using these two properties

156
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,440
it is possible to represent the round

157
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,840
function for craft

158
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,400
and for this purpose we also separate

159
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,360
both

160
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,599
the addron toy key and sub box

161
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,199
operations into two parts that each part

162
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,360
works on half of the

163
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,880
state

164
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,919
here in this figure we depict the two

165
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,639
consecutive rounds of craft

166
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,800
the left branch shows the

167
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,680
upper half upper half of the state and

168
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,639
the right branch shows the bottom half

169
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,599
it starts with mixed column

170
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,039
then add round

171
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,199
adron constants

172
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,000
at round tweak is that is separated to

173
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,720
two parts then sub box

174
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,199
that is again separated to two parts and

175
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,560
then permute nibbles

176
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,000
it is possible to bring the

177
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,440
sp prime and pn double prime and switch

178
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,599
their position

179
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,280
and also

180
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,599
here sp prime mpn prime

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,039
moreover it is possible to bring these

182
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,520
sp prime mpn prime

183
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,599
from here ending

184
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,639
end of the left branch

185
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,759
to the

186
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,400
beginning of right branch in the next

187
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
round

188
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,840
as it is shown in this figure

189
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,640
again these two operations

190
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,039
can be uh transmitted to inside of mix

191
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,799
inside of bridging branch and also after

192
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,919
the bridge

193
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,120
point so like this

194
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,640
we bring this two operations to here and

195
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,040
also here

196
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,480
as i said we can switch the position of

197
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,959
these two operations and also these two

198
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,320
operations

199
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,720
by switching a position of these two

200
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,360
operations

201
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,320
since p and prime and p and double prime

202
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,720
are inverse of each other

203
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,279
we can remove them just by modifying

204
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,160
this

205
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,880
three key addition

206
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,000
we denote this modified to e key by

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,480
by tk triple prime

208
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,399
this is a new representation of the

209
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,800
craft round function which is very

210
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,839
similar

211
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,839
similar to the faisal network

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,880
with the the only difference is that in

213
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,519
the physical network the right branch

214
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,920
transits to the left branch of the next

215
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,440
round without any changes

216
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,800
in uh

217
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,839
that in our case in

218
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,080
here uh

219
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,200
this transition is over a key dependent

220
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,839
s box layer for craft

221
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,399
but in the case of 5 cell network it

222
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,000
should be identity function

223
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,680
however due to the involutive being of

224
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,640
the s box if and only if

225
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,560
the value 40k triple prime is zero then

226
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,360
this key dependent s box layer will be

227
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,120
the same as the identity function

228
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,680
then for a run with these week two key

229
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,880
values

230
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,320
we will have

231
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,600
this round function and if all the runs

232
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,040
have the same kind of big toy key value

233
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,560
the cipher will follow the

234
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,319
vista network's structure

235
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,640
therefore for the current tricky

236
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,120
schedule of craft with the proposed key

237
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,800
permutation the 128-bit key must be one

238
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,880
of the two to the 88v keys and for

239
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,680
each wiki there are exactly two to the

240
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,440
eight big tweak

241
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,600
big tweaks

242
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,440
we should emphasize that the q

243
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,120
permutation plays an important role here

244
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,680
in determining the size of

245
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
sets for v keys

246
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,920
or weak tweaks

247
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,640
in this in the paper we showed that

248
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,640
depending on the queue permutation the

249
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,240
size of

250
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,079
the key set

251
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:30,000
can vary from 2 to the 68 to 2 today

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,680
from 2 to the 68 to 2 to the 96.

253
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,920
we recall that the only criterion for

254
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,680
the current queue permutation

255
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,079
was to be circulated permutation

256
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,920
from those 15 factorial six

257
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
15 factorial

258
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,240
circulant permutations

259
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,200
satisfying this condition

260
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
only one thousand

261
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,079
one thousand were taken randomly and the

262
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,720
one with maximum resistance against the

263
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,959
related tweak differential

264
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,839
was chosen as the q permutation

265
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,760
here in this paper

266
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,680
we showed that the queue permutation

267
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
could be also chosen in a way to

268
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,760
minimize the size for

269
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,880
for the big key set

270
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,839
there is another observation in the big

271
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,320
three key structure of the craft

272
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,079
it is well known that

273
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,599
we can bring the rank twicky from here

274
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,839
to input of the bridging branch

275
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,040
since the round tweak is used in the

276
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,320
craft are iterating over

277
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,839
every four rounds in the round functions

278
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,440
in the right figure

279
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,200
the equivalent tweak is will be

280
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,839
iterative over eight rounds

281
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,839
and uh

282
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,440
these equivalent eq tweaks will be as

283
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,200
as it is shown in this equations

284
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,160
as you see the first and the last

285
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,800
three keys equivalent three keys

286
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,360
both are zero and the two middle ones

287
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,839
are only dependent on the tweak values

288
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,639
this new representation and the and the

289
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,959
victory key structure of the cipher can

290
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,440
be applied against different types of

291
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,720
attacks to evaluate its security but in

292
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,560
this paper we only did it for

293
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,360
differential analysis and now i'm going

294
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,680
to talk about

295
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,320
about the details

296
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
we started with counting the number of

297
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,120
minimum activist boxes in the different

298
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,360
in the differential trails

299
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,160
for this we use the milp tool introduced

300
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,839
by sunital at asiacrypt 2014

301
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,399
to find all the differential patterns

302
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,199
with the minimum activist boxes

303
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,680
and here are the results the numbers in

304
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,240
the first row are for the original craft

305
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,720
and the numbers in the second row are

306
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,959
for the victory key structure of the

307
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,240
cipher

308
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,680
as you see in almost all of the rounds

309
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,959
numbers for week 2 key is half of the

310
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,000
ones

311
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,279
for original for the original cipher

312
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,440
note that this tool does not consider

313
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,320
the s box used in the cipher and only

314
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,560
considers the transitions within the

315
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,760
linear

316
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,160
layer

317
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,360
then using these differential patterns

318
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,199
with the minimum number of activist

319
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,320
boxes

320
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,880
for each number of rounds we use the

321
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,920
tool introduced by maria alseta corlanda

322
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,800
and me at indocrypt 2020

323
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,959
to find the differentials with the

324
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,360
highest edp value

325
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,040
precisely

326
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,680
for all individual input and output

327
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,800
differential values this tool sums

328
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,000
edp of all differential trails within

329
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,240
the given activity pattern

330
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,120
therefore the edp value written by this

331
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,320
tool will be will be a lower value than

332
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,160
its exact value

333
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,720
in the table we report the maximum value

334
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,760
for etp of these differentials

335
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,000
note that the values are given in the

336
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,839
logarithmic

337
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,959
in the basis of two

338
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,440
as you see we could find 19 round

339
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,160
differences with edp of slightly better

340
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,040
than 2 to the minus 64

341
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,320
but it was not possible uh to find any

342
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,120
for

343
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,560
20 rounds or more

344
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,800
for the next step of our

345
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,440
analysis we try to make the big three

346
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,839
key extract victory key sets larger

347
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,240
for this

348
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,000
for this

349
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,880
goal we use this simple relation that

350
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,680
for an inactive kid s box

351
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,000
we do not necessarily need the three key

352
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,079
value to be to be

353
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,399
zero

354
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,560
because for any trick

355
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,519
to a key value if the input difference

356
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,040
to the to this keyed xbox is zero the

357
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,040
output difference also will be zero

358
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,560
for example here we show one of

359
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,440
one of the four 18 round differential

360
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,360
patterns with the minimum number of

361
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,959
activist boxes

362
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,880
and also

363
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,920
the one

364
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,199
active

365
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,079
a differential pattern uh

366
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,279
that

367
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,680
includes a differential with the highest

368
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,320
reported edp value

369
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,279
here we only need to fix the run two key

370
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,600
neighbors which correspond to the

371
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,720
activist active kid as boxes

372
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,519
and we show these nibbles in blue color

373
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,280
those two key neighbors are listed here

374
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,559
and since

375
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,039
the run tweakies are iterative after

376
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,319
four rounds

377
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,039
all of these equations can be can be

378
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,400
simplified

379
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,839
to this short list

380
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,280
satisfying these equations needs that

381
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,280
the 128 bit key must be one of the two

382
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,160
to the

383
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,000
112 v keys and the tweak must be one of

384
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,200
the two to the 48-week tweaks

385
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,480
which but with three extra conditions

386
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,760
between key and tweak nibbles so there

387
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,720
are exactly two to the 36 weak tweaks

388
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,240
for each weak key value

389
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,480
until this point we have discussed the

390
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,960
single tweak differentials

391
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,400
to use the related tweaks in the weak

392
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,720
key structure of the craft

393
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,440
we need to make sure that in the keyed

394
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,280
x-boxes

395
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,919
the three key difference

396
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,360
all are equal to zero

397
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,799
using this condition on

398
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,600
all the rounds

399
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,960
we need that the differences in these

400
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,200
nibbles listed here

401
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,679
to be zero

402
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,000
therefore two nibbles of the tweak

403
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,160
namely nibbles index 2 and 5 are free to

404
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,120
have enough road differences

405
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,760
the second attack represented in this

406
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,799
paper

407
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,240
is based on the 1

408
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,280
the 21 run differentials with index rt0

409
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,440
using these differentials we could do a

410
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,400
key recovery attack on 26 rounds of the

411
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,440
cipher

412
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,480
the differentials used in this attack

413
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,919
have an edp of about 2 to the minus 61

414
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,480
and we extend them by 4 rounds on the

415
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,559
plaintext side and one round on the

416
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,600
ciphertext site for key recovery

417
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,520
the attack works for

418
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,520
2 to the 108b keys and 2 to the 52 weak

419
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,640
tweaks

420
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,120
but there are three extra conditions

421
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,000
between key and twitch nibbles so it

422
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,679
means 2 to the 40 week tweaks for

423
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,720
each

424
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,559
v key value

425
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,799
the complexity of this

426
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,840
attack is about 2 to the 105

427
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,559
encryptions

428
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,000
and two to the

429
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,919
seventy three chosen

430
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:24,799
tweak

431
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,840
uh

432
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,000
tweaked plenty except for text types of

433
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,120
data

434
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,679
and it needs two to the sixty blocks of

435
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,679
memory

436
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,120
to summarize this paper first we

437
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,440
presented an equivalent representation

438
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,159
of kraft black cipher then we showed how

439
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,960
to make this representation to a victory

440
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,360
key structure that follows the feistel

441
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,400
network

442
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,880
and then we analyze this structure

443
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,640
against the differential attack

444
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,840
we presented 23 rounds single tweak and

445
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,720
a 26 round related tweak differential

446
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,919
attacks in the v key scenario and as far

447
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,480
as we know they are the best attacks

448
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,280
against craft by definition of best to

449
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,039
be

450
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,280
the highest to be with the highest

451
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,799
number of rounds

452
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,520
emphasize that these

453
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
attacks do not overcome the security

454
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,679
claim of the cipher

455
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,520
and thank you for watching this video
