00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
hello everyone the title of this talk is

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,480
v keys in reduced agis and chaoshin this

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,880
is a joint work with takanoli isobe

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,920
willimer and jose sakamoto

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,719
this is an overview of this talk

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,119
so first i will

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,960
introduce the cryptanalysis of agis then

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,840
i will introduce the application to

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,560
kaohsin finally i will make some

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,439
discussions and draw the conclusions

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,599
first i will briefly introduce the

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,960
background of ags

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,920
128. it belongs to the aegs family

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,719
submitted to the kaiser competition in

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,280
the ages family there are ages 128

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,239
ags 128 air and ages

17
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:51,039
256

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,559
the first of which targets for the 128

19
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,800
bit security were the last one targets

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,120
for the

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,559
256-bit security

22
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,799
among them ags 128 has been selected in

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,840
a final portfolio for high performance

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,640
applications in the competition

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,040
for its normal and efficient designs

26
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,280
it's surprising that there's no

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,159
cryptanalysis of aegs initialization

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,960
phase during the six-year competition

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,119
and there are only two papers targets

30
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,680
for its keystream phase

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,000
where only ags

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,520
256

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,960
was shown to be insecure

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,799
this makes us wonder

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,759
whether analyzing the initial phrase is

36
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,960
too difficult or

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,640
this topic is just not interesting

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,479
whatever it is

39
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,799
we think it's meaningful to analyze it

40
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,200
because it has been selected as one of

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,840
the winners of the competition and its

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,119
design using the aes run function as the

43
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,640
main component has inspired several

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,600
ultra fast symmetrical primitives

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,119
designs

46
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,120
this is an illustration of the aegis 128

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,480
run function

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,200
as you can see the state is divided into

49
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
five blocks

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,440
and each block is of size 128 bits

51
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,680
in this figure a denotes the a as around

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,480
function by omitting the add around

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,400
constant operation

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
the run function slightly differs

55
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,920
depending on the random number r if i is

56
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,360
old

57
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,519
updating xr0 will involve k however when

58
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,040
r is a un updating x r0 here will

59
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,840
involve both k and n

60
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,519
we are both where k

61
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,480
and n denotes the

62
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,440
128 bit key and 128 bit

63
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,239
nouns respectively

64
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,560
there are in total 10 initialization

65
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,840
rounds and the initial stage

66
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,840
is defined in this way where c0 and c1

67
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,560
are both 128 bit constants

68
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,080
supposing the target is i initialization

69
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,840
supposing the target is our

70
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,720
initialization runs what we can know is

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,239
only theta where theta equals 2 x r1

72
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,920
plus xr4 plus xr2 and xr3

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,519
so we cannot know the specific value of

74
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,560
each block what we can know is only

75
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,920
a citar which is

76
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,120
computed according to some combinations

77
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,239
of the

78
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,799
uh blocks so

79
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,040
how to analyze the security of such a

80
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,560
construction

81
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,599
from its description it cleared out aes

82
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,360
and ags 128 are very similar

83
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,680
so it is inevitable to use some

84
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,480
distinguishes for reduced aes to start

85
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,439
it

86
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,720
for such distinguishers we have the four

87
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,200
round integral distinguisher the file

88
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,680
run multiple of a distinguisher and the

89
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,840
five sixth round or yo-yo like

90
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,360
distinguishers

91
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,000
however not all of them are friendly to

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,839
our attacks

93
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,839
the main problem is that what the

94
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,000
attacker know is only zeta not the exact

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
value of the of each block of internal

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,320
state

97
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,680
obviously the integral distinguisher is

98
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,199
more friendly because we can

99
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,040
independently study the integral

100
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,040
properties of x i y x xr4 and xr2 and

101
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,400
xr3 however if we use the remaining

102
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,960
distinguishers we may be required to

103
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,840
study the interactions between them

104
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,400
which will increase the difficulty to

105
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,000
analyze it so we finally chose to use

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,479
the integral distinguisher to analyze

107
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,800
reduce ages 128 the main strategy is to

108
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
write down and study the integral

109
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,360
properties of the expressions of x r1

110
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,240
xr3 and xr and xr3 in terms of the nonce

111
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,440
a and the key k respectively

112
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,000
so what kind of expression should we

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
study

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,880
the boolean expression obviously this is

115
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,759
not

116
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,400
this is impractical because it is too

117
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,479
complex

118
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,800
considering the nature of the round

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,759
function we find it more feasible to

120
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,080
write and analyze the expressions by

121
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,240
treating a 128-bit

122
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,160
world as a unit

123
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,479
this is because the diffusion between

124
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,520
different 100 and bit blocks

125
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,759
is very slow

126
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,639
during the round update so

127
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,360
you can see from this figure so the

128
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
diffusion between each blocks is very

129
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,000
slow

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,639
with this basic strategy in mind we

131
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,280
first write expressions after file runs

132
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,960
of update

133
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,520
for simplicity we eliminate the constant

134
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,319
and key variables in the expressions

135
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,240
note that

136
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,919
only x file y x f 2 x value 3 and x 4

137
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,360
are involved in the calculation of theta

138
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,160
and in their expressions m passes

139
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,960
through at the most 4 8 runs so there

140
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,600
seems to be chance to find an integral

141
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,199
attack on fire round aes aegis 128

142
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,840
however there are still some problems

143
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,840
first although m passes through 4 8 runs

144
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,960
in x-file 4 the way it passes through

145
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,360
4-8 runs is rather complex so it is

146
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
unclear whether we will lose the

147
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,199
foreground aes

148
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,520
integral property for

149
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,599
x file 4.

150
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,800
the second and the most important

151
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,759
obstacle is that

152
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,000
we have to start the integral property

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,400
for x valve 2 and x 3.

154
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,199
however the expressions are very complex

155
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,400
and this there seems to be little chance

156
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,800
we can find uh

157
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,360
usable integral properties for it

158
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,759
so

159
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,960
the problems now become clear

160
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,360
that's the integral properties for x

161
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,000
value 4 and the integral properties for

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,639
x factor 2 and x 5 3.

163
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,120
with the problems in mind we now

164
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,520
carefully write and analyze the actual

165
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,560
expressions after each round of update

166
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,280
after run run update the expressions are

167
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,759
listed here so you can see that they are

168
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,000
very simple note that we always

169
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,720
introduce newer variables new constant

170
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,360
variables ci to represent the constants

171
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,440
derived from k c0 and c1

172
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,759
after two rounds of update the

173
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,800
expressions are still very simple

174
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,680
however after three runs of update the

175
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,120
expressions are somewhat complex

176
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,440
a critical observation is that we can

177
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,919
simply simplify the expressions by

178
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,758
adding proper conditions on k

179
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,319
specifically uh if equation while holds

180
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,039
then we can introduce a new row a

181
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,240
constant variable c9 to represent the

182
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,599
whole a whole complex expression

183
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,679
this is because when equation 1 holds

184
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,559
and

185
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,599
when

186
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,560
only

187
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,440
in

188
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,560
and when

189
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,440
n only varies at the first

190
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,000
diagonal

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,480
then in a plus n plus a

192
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,399
m plus a k plus c y is constant

193
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,120
in this way the expressions of the three

194
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,080
rounds of update can be simplified as

195
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,600
shown here

196
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,240
in addition if we further introduce a

197
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,040
variable t to represent the expression c

198
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,440
0 plus a k plus m

199
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,200
the expressions can be further

200
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,440
simplified as shown here

201
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,320
so now the expressions has become much

202
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,760
more concise and simpler

203
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,480
which is easier for us to do some

204
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,200
analysis

205
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,880
the benefits to introduce the variable t

206
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,959
is obvious first

207
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,440
it can make the expressions more concise

208
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,480
and easier to start it second it can

209
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,680
invisibly append what we can invisibly

210
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,760
we can visibly open one round for

211
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,560
perhaps for key recovery if we can find

212
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,440
properties of zeta but only starting t

213
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,320
there they aim

214
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,760
a pending runs for key recovery

215
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,480
for a distinguisher it's common for the

216
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,279
cryptanalysis of block ciphers this is

217
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,680
obviously not uh intuitive for ags

218
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,360
because

219
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,440
due to the construction of the run

220
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,480
function

221
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,360
at the first glance we seem to lose its

222
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,040
integral property

223
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,240
however is it true

224
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,800
let's uh we can we can introduce a new

225
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,920
variable g to represent the expression

226
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,880
we proved in the paper that when g

227
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,440
zero takes all the 2 to the 8 values and

228
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,560
the remaining bias of t are constants

229
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,440
for each ig the same value of g i gl

230
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,079
will appear an even number of times

231
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,480
specifically so for this state the same

232
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,640
value of each byte

233
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,240
will take

234
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
the same value of each byte will appear

235
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,440
a even number of times obviously this

236
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,920
property will be preserved through the

237
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,000
xbox transformation then after the

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,279
linear transformation obviously

239
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,480
each byte is balanced in other words the

240
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,160
sum of x bar 4 is 0.

241
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,399
at the last we need to start the

242
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,440
integral property for x valve two and x

243
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,200
factor three

244
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,279
this is uh

245
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,839
now our thin probe because we only need

246
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,720
to study the integral property for this

247
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,720
expression

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,279
and from this figure we can immediately

249
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,120
observe that the last uh the last three

250
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,320
columns

251
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,720
are all balanced

252
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
so

253
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,880
for foul round ages 128

254
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,079
we have the we have such so we have this

255
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,160
integral property

256
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,720
but considering the relation between t

257
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,639
and n we also we we have that when the

258
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,440
first diagonal of n takes all the two to

259
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,760
the 32 possible values

260
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,240
the last three columns of theta are

261
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,760
balanced

262
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,639
indeed we can further prove that in this

263
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,120
case the whole state of scita is

264
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,600
balanced

265
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,480
this is mainly because

266
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,079
so

267
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,680
here so

268
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,360
we can prove that in this case

269
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,839
these four these four bytes are also

270
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,320
balanced

271
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,040
so

272
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,680
based on the distinguisher we can

273
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,120
mount a key recovery attack specifically

274
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,839
based off of according to the v key

275
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,760
condition we can pre-compute 2 to the 20

276
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,320
uh 24 possible values for the first

277
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,839
diagonal of k

278
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,399
then

279
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,360
according to the uh this distinct

280
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,680
according to the distinguisher built on

281
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,440
t and the relation between t and n we

282
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,240
can

283
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,480
uh really recover the fast first

284
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,200
diagonal of k with time complexity 2 to

285
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,800
the 32

286
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,079
after recovering the first diagonal of k

287
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,880
we can recover the remaining diagonals

288
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,000
independently by checking the condition

289
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,639
on kii and by taking this condition

290
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,920
and in this in this after this phase we

291
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,200
will obtain 2 to the 24 possible values

292
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,399
for each

293
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,360
uh

294
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,240
for each of the remaining diagonals of k

295
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,920
so

296
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,519
there are in total 2 to the uh

297
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,240
due to the 72 possible candidates for

298
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,600
the whole k

299
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,279
and therefore

300
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,240
the num uh the time complexity of the

301
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,079
key recovery attack is 2 to the 22 and

302
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,040
the

303
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,639
data complexity is 2 to the 32.

304
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,760
since the number of weakest is larger

305
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,120
than the

306
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,920
uh

307
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,480
complexity of our text

308
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,399
so we obtain a valid key recovery attack

309
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,880
due to time limit i will only describe

310
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,639
the main problems we made when

311
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,720
constructing the eight round integral

312
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,959
distinguisher for calcium

313
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,680
the role of the v case in calcium is to

314
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,440
turn a probabilistic integral

315
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,680
distinguisher into a deterministic

316
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,199
integral distinguisher specifically

317
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,000
for absolute choice of four

318
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,279
four constants c 0 c 1 c 2 3 3 there

319
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,440
will be no deterministic integral

320
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,000
property uh for

321
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,279
for this one so so there's no integral

322
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,639
property for

323
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,399
for this one however

324
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,199
if we add one of the

325
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,399
one of any one of the three conditions

326
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,600
this

327
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,639
this

328
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,320
or this

329
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,279
uh there will be a deterministic

330
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,360
integral uh

331
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,160
property for the thumb

332
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,000
so this is where

333
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,920
we need to add the

334
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,000
so this is why we need to use the

335
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,839
weakest

336
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:12,959
then

337
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,760
we're analyzing the expressions we also

338
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,600
we're also faced with the problem to

339
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,160
determine the integral property for this

340
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,720
expression

341
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,680
as the first glance it seems that

342
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,839
we may have the integral property

343
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,880
because

344
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,079
s only passes through four eighth rounds

345
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,839
however

346
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:34,880
if you

347
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,440
if you start it by

348
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,800
by by drawing some figures by drawing

349
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,279
some figures like this you will find

350
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,320
that

351
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,240
you don't know what's the actual

352
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,920
integral property

353
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,720
uh it is

354
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,040
it has

355
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,639
indeed we prove that for archery aim

356
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,399
or it will always be balanced this is

357
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,720
surprising and

358
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,959
the main reason

359
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,759
why we have such a property is that the

360
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,759
same value of

361
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,800
this will appear an even number of times

362
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,320
when a certain diagonal of s traverses

363
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,839
all the 2 to the

364
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,360
32 values it's interesting to see

365
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,600
whether the divine property can capture

366
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,240
such an integral property

367
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,320
we gave an example in the paper to

368
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
explain why the conventional bit based

369
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,480
division property cannot capture such a

370
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,639
property where the same value of the

371
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,639
whole state appears an even number of

372
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,959
times in a much set

373
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,880
a possible solution is to count the

374
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,079
divine the number of divine trails

375
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,959
which is a reasonably new idea however

376
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,959
for large aim that also seems

377
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,959
impractical because such chairs will

378
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,040
explode as the number of missed column

379
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,360
increases

380
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,399
this seems to reveal the importance to

381
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,680
prove such an integral property and

382
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,599
these also seem to reveal there are

383
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,160
still some they still some room

384
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,039
for

385
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,880
divine property for this problem

386
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,919
at the last we draw conclusions for we

387
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,760
draw some conclusions of this talk first

388
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,720
starting ajs and calcium-like ciphers in

389
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,119
the weakest setting has more potential

390
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,160
second

391
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,799
for ajs taoshi for aegis 128

392
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,280
we use conditions on the key to simplify

393
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,080
the quadratic part of the observable

394
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,720
output which can be equivalently viewed

395
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,520
as reducing the algebra degree

396
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,160
for taoshin we use conditions on the key

397
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,000
to turn a probabilistic integral

398
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,120
distinguisher to a deterministic

399
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,720
deterministic distinguisher however

400
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,520
uh

401
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,679
we have to carefully study the

402
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,960
expressions

403
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,120
before we noticing it

404
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,840
in addition for taoshin there seems to

405
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,880
be one useless round because indeed

406
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,080
because we indeed started a n rather

407
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,600
than n

408
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,960
finally for both aegis 128 and calcium

409
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,080
key recovery techniques are demands

410
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,320
are assured and

411
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,480
its feasibility much depends on the

412
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,840
dedicated analysis of the expressions

413
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,120
and this is not visible as common

414
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,720
methods to append runs for key recovery

415
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,520
that's all thank you
