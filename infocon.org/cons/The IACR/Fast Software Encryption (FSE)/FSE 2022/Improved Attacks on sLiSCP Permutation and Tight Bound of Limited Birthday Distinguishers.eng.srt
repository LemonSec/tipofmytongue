hello everyone

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,520
the title of the story is improved

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,800
attacks on sli scp foundation and the

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,040
tight band of limited birthday

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,400
distinctions

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,839
the ulcers are nori yamada mariana

presence here and myself isis saga

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,880
our analysis target is sli scp

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,599
which is a cryptographic annotation for

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,880
lightweight aeds designed by avatably at

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,520
the original version was presented at

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,520
the sac 2017

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,879
and later

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,480
the improved version called the snr scp

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,120
light was presented

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,760
and the slr cpu light

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,440
is an underlying primitive for specs and

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,360

graphics competition

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,120
this slide shows overview of our

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,360
contributions

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,240
for the first part we present improved

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,560
crypto nurses of sli ssdp and sli as cp

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,159
lite

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,680
previous best attacks on sdna scp were

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,640
limited birthday decisions by rebound

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,240
attacks

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,520
here we introduced more sophisticated

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,840
procedure of the event phase and the

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,479
more optimized the differential trails

33
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,759
for the outbound phase

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,840
then we achieved a reduced complexity or

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,400
more attacking rounds

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,320
this is the first third party analysis

37
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,039
reaching more rounds than the desires

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,360
for the second part

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,720
we give a proof of the low amount of

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,200
limited volatility distinctions for

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,000
publications

42
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,920
previously the lower bound was known

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,799
only for functions

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,280
in this research we first define the

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,400
game and identify the best strategy to

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,800
win the game and then simply but

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,520
preciously evaluate the number of

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,840
queries to win the game with a

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,000
sufficiently large probability

50
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,920
as a result the lower bound matches the

51
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,640
conjecture for the best generic attack

52
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,160
in many existing verbs

53
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,239
our attacks only work for the underlying

54
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,200
communications of states and stock

55
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,080
thus do not threaten the security of ada

56
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,560
at the time of the fabrication

57
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,920
the next lwc was in the middle of its

58
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,200
second stage

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
and speaks in stock while valid

60
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,440
candidates

61
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,400
speaks and spock unfortunately didn't

62
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,560
make in the final round

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,040
while mist correctly understood the

64
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,800
impact of our other results

65
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,680
missed statements can be found in their

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,000
status report on the second round

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,640
from now on i've explained the first

68
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,840
part of the paper which is improved

69
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
attacks on two publications

70
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,040
this slide shows the limited positive

71
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,679
essentials

72
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,879
limited positive distinctions are

73
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,920
discussed to measure the security of a

74
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,200
function or a plantation

75
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,040
the goal is to find a pair of text such

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,760
that the input difference is filled in

77
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,319
and the output difference is build out

78
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,599
the known best generic dac was presented

79
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,519
by gb and

80
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,680
at 2010

81
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,200
and the complexity is shown here

82
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
and this was

83
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,400
proven to be tight for functions

84
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,519
however the tightness is unknown for

85
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,319
publications

86
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,839
rebound attacks are popular approaches

87
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,479
to mount limited birthday designations

88
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,400
rebounded tags are inside out approaches

89
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,680
to satisfy differentiable trails for

90
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,880
keyless primitives

91
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,680
the permutation is divided into three

92
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,840
parts

93
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,199
and the dark consists of inbound base

94
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,720
and outland phase

95
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,360
in the inbound phase

96
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,600
attacker generates

97
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,080
many paired bodies

98
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,320
satisfying the differential transitions

99
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,040
for the middle part

100
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,440
and in the outbound phase

101
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,600
paired values are propagated to the

102
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,639
input and output to satisfy the target

103
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,120
difference

104
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,600
the keyless nature

105
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,400
allows attackers to stop from the middle

106
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,280
this page shows the structure of slr

107
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,680
sctp and sli scp light

108
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,919
for sli scp

109
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,479
the permutation size can be chosen from

110
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,160
two options

111
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,240
the 192-bit version is called sli

112
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,520
scp-182 and

113
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,479
the 256-bit version is called sli fcp256

114
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,160
both adapt the full branch type 2

115
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
generalizes the piston network

116
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,240
and the partition consists of 18 steps

117
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,919
and the step function of sli-scp is

118
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,160
shown in the left-hand side of the

119
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,560
middle

120
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,280
if the functions of the stiff function

121
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,680
are reduced around the cement

122
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,120
particularly

123
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,360
six runs make 48

124
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,479
for sli sp182

125
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,080
and

126
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,000
eight months make 64 for 256 bit version

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,960
the round function of cmec

128
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,600
is shown in the right hand side of the

129
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,000
middle

130
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,199
the design of sli scp light is

131
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,319
similar to the one of sli scp

132
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,080
it used the full branch misty structure

133
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,840
to

134
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,719
introduce paradigm computations

135
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,080
the step function of sli speed light is

136
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,120
shown in the bottom

137
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,520
the previous twitter nurses on sli scp

138
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,400
focused on six step iterative

139
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,520
differential trails

140
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
so suppose that

141
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,080
the f function i mean the reduced random

142
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,039
cement

143
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,440
satisfy the following differential

144
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,039
propagation

145
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,000
first

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,199
alpha is propagated to vector with

147
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,039
probability p1

148
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,160
and beta that's the alpha is probability

149
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,319
p2

150
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,000
then the 6-step iterative trail is

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,360
satisfied with the probability p1 to the

152
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,440
power 4 and

153
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,400
p2 to the power 2.

154
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,240
we found a similar six-step iterative

155
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,599
differential betrayals for slr sscp lite

156
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,199
this trail has the same probability

157
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,759
which is p 1 to the power 4 p to the

158
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,360
power 2

159
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,000
but the difference at the iterating

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,080
point is switched from advantage

161
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,199
in this research

162
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,240
we

163
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,960
did a detailed analysis

164
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,000
both

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,919
of sli scp and slr ssp lite

166
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,120
however the results are often

167
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,000
very similar to both

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,839
so in this talk we focus on sli scp

169
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,559
this page shows a lot idea

170
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,959
how we gathered the improvement

171
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,920
first

172
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,640
a 15 step differential trail was built

173
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,080
by simply iterating the six step

174
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,959
iterative trail

175
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,360
in the previous work

176
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,560
the iman phase is located in the middle

177
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
three steps

178
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,360
which is

179
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,920
filled by yellow in this figure

180
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,399
this means this means that

181
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,200
these are 12 steps are covered by the

182
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
other one phase

183
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,680
and

184
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,240
differential transitions are satisfied

185
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,240
probabilistically

186
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,200
in this work

187
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,480
we found that the inbound phase can

188
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,839
cover one more step without increasing

189
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,519
the complexity

190
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,680
which is filled by blue in this figure

191
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,600
so the number of steps

192
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,279
in outbound phase is reduced

193
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,240
and

194
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,120
the complexity is also reduced

195
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,160
or this gives us an opportunity to

196
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,160
extend the number of steps

197
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,200
this slide shows the previous three-step

198
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,839
inbound

199
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,120
phase there are four active cements

200
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,399
in the inbound base

201
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,120
for each active cmac

202
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,760
the attacker should test all input

203
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,360
values

204
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,560
and store

205
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,279
all the paired values satisfying the

206
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,320
differential transition

207
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,360
note that the cost of this part

208
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,480
is to test all inputs to the cmec

209
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,480
so which is at most two to three 48 or

210
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,519
this is 64 depending on the publication

211
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,839
size

212
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,040
as an output of the inbound phase

213
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,560
any paired values for each cement can be

214
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,600
chosen independently

215
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,040
and this will fix the interstate so the

216
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
remaining is

217
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,839
just to test if the outbound phase can

218
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,120
be satisfied or not

219
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,360
this page shows our new inbound phase

220
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,279
that can cover four steps

221
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,959
the first part of the dark procedure is

222
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,720
exactly the same

223
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,680
so for each active cement

224
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,120
the writer should test all inputs and to

225
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,079
store all the everybody's satisfying the

226
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,359
differential transitions

227
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,760
then we carefully choose paired values

228
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,279
in an appropriate order

229
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,480
first

230
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,440
we choose paired buttons for three

231
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,079
particular active cement which are

232
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,920
colored by blue in this figure

233
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,720
the choice of those three active cement

234
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,639
can be completely independent

235
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,040
but after fixing those three

236
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,000
paired values for another synonym filled

237
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,839
by green's figure of

238
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,839
it so we can test the validity of step

239
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,200
one

240
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,519
here

241
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,959
finally after satisfying steps one and

242
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,360
two we still have degrees of freedom in

243
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,519
another active cement

244
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,639
which is filled by yellow in this figure

245
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,360
and the choice of appeared values of

246
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,639
this yellow cement is completely

247
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,160
independent from the other part

248
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,440
so we can start the outbound phase by

249
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,639
using degrees of freedom of this yellow

250
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,639
sink

251
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,000
this slide shows a love idea

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,560
to extend the number of adaptive steps

253
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,079
the techniques in the previous slides

254
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,760
are for reducing

255
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,600
the complexity

256
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,240
to exploit the remaining degrees of

257
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
freedom

258
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,240
however to extend the number of steps

259
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,839
the bottom neck is the total amount of

260
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,160
degrees of freedom

261
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,680
now unfortunately degrees are short to

262
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,399
satisfy one more steps

263
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,680
so they

264
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,600
extending the number of steps is

265
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,320
non-trivial

266
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,480
in the previous 15 step attack

267
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
in the last step

268
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,800
differential propagation

269
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,600
is

270
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,399
uncontrolled

271
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,959
so the attacker

272
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:53,920
doesn't

273
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,639
spend any cost to control the

274
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,800
propagation

275
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,639
as a result

276
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,639
probability one

277
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
the docker doesn't know the output

278
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,518
difference from the symmetric function

279
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,240
so in this research

280
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,920
we try to control the 15th step

281
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,600
only partially

282
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,959
so we specify that alpha

283
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,839
is propagated to gamma

284
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,480
where only a part of the bits of gamma

285
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,279
is specified active or inactive

286
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,160
so we have to be careful that

287
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,040
with

288
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,680
more unknown bits in the output

289
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,320
the generic attack cost is also reduced

290
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,160
so we need to find

291
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,839
a good trade-off between

292
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,120
the amount of consumed decrease and the

293
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,639
amount of

294
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,199
the number of bits of gamma which is a

295
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,880
specified octave or inactive

296
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,760
and we found a configuration to be a

297
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,600
valid 16 step attack

298
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,720
from here

299
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,000
i'm going to explain the lower bound of

300
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,079
limited pathway distinctions or

301
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,800
permutations

302
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,079
recall that

303
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,040
in the limited business distinctions

304
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,240
the doctor tries to find a pair of the

305
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,000
text

306
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,120
whose input difference is built in and

307
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,079
the output difference is built out

308
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,440
the previous this attack complexity

309
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,720
is as shown in the middle

310
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,360
and we prove

311
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,920
the lower bound

312
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,120
which is

313
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,199
tight up to a constant factor of 1 over

314
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,680
4.

315
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,079
the game of limited birthday problem can

316
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,440
be formalized as shown here

317
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,920
the top one is the definition of the

318
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,839
game which is quite natural

319
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,519
the middle defines the procedure for the

320
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,399
foreign query

321
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,800
so when x

322
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,959
is curved

323
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,000
then

324
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,680
the oracle checks

325
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,480
if a pair x y

326
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,839
is already

327
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,120
equivalent before for some point

328
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,480
if it is

329
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,759
then the oracle returns by

330
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,800
so that means for

331
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,040
for the query which has already been

332
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,680
asked then it returns the same results

333
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,920
as before

334
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,440
if x is new then

335
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,839
it chooses y randomly from enemy space

336
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,720
except for the values which

337
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,519
were already queried as y

338
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,119
then the x

339
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,480
y and the pair x y

340
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,679
are added to the list

341
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,799
the behaviors

342
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,359
for the inverse query can also be

343
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,599
defined in the similar manner

344
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,319
this page shows the proof approach

345
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,320
at each query

346
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,160
the adversary tries its best to obtain a

347
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,240
new pair

348
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,080
such that the input difference and

349
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,120
output difference satisfy the goal of

350
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
the limited loss extinctions for

351
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,039
existing explosion by dash

352
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,160
so namely the adversary performs the

353
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,120
following in every query

354
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,840
first the adversary choose the largest

355
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
subset s

356
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
such that

357
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,200
for all x plus y dash and x does dash y

358
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
dash

359
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,400
the input difference

360
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,160
satisfies delta e

361
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,280
then adversely choose a fresh x such

362
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,080
that the input difference satisfies

363
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,120
delta in for all x dash y dash in the

364
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,600
subset

365
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,840
then x is queried to p

366
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,000
to expect that

367
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,679
its output y satisfies the target

368
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,240
difference

369
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,640
let p i be the probability of win at the

370
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,960
i query

371
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,880
and we first

372
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,799
down the probability p i

373
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,720
so then the probability of adversary

374
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,880
wins is

375
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,799
bounded by the sum of p i where i stands

376
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,760
from 1 to q

377
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,600
so obviously

378
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,520
pq is the largest among any pi so it's

379
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,200
bounded by

380
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,960
q times uh

381
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,840
q times p u

382
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,039
and finally we involve eight p as both

383
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,880
wins to show that it is less than one

384
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,039
over two if

385
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,440
the query the number of queries q is

386
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,960
smaller than of about

387
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,240
so i try to give concluding remarks

388
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,200
so in the first part of this talk i

389
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,919
explained improved crypto analysis of

390
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,520
sli scp and sli scp light

391
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,559
the number of duck steps reached 16

392
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,240
steps out of 18 steps

393
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,720
in the second part

394
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,600
we proved the new lower bound of limited

395
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,200
positive signatures for permutations

396
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,520
the lower bound matched the known best

397
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,158
generic attack up to a constant factor

398
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,039
that's about the talk thank you for your

399
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,039
attention
