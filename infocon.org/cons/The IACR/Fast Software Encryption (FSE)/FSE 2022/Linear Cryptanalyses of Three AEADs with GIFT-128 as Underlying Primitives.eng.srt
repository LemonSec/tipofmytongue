00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,760
hello everyone the name of the

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,200
presentation is linear crypto analysis

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,120
of 380ad

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,599
with gift

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,879
128 as underlying primitives

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,439
in this presentation we start with the

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,000
motivation and contributions

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,640
following that we briefly recall some

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,199
related preliminaries

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,519
then we introduced the linear crypt

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,320
analysis of gifts ufb hyena sunday gift

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,200
and gift 128.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,360
at last we gave a conclusion

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,360
so firstly the motivation of this work

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,640
linear cryptanalysis is one of the most

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,199
fundamental methods to evaluate the

17
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,199
security of symmetric key primitives

18
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,160
compared to differential cryptanalysis

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,800
we find that linear method is more

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,880
suitable to the analyze of the aead

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,920
since it works under the known plaintext

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,640
attack setting

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,080
this paper aims to evaluate the security

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,520
of some aed with a linear method

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,840
the contribution of this work can be

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,560
divided into four parts

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,439
firstly we create specialized set

28
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,680
problems for the search of linear

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,240
distinguishers coordinate with the

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,759
attack setting

31
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,400
with this method we improve linear

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,400
attacks on gift cofb and sunday gift

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,360
certainly they proposed the first script

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,560
analytics result on hyena

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,759
also they provide improved linear attack

36
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,200
on gift 6 of 128.

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,920
now we briefly recall some necessary

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,920
preliminaries

39
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,440
gift 128 is one version of gift with vc

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,120
at

41
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,720
128 bit block size

42
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,040
it is a 40 round spin server and has a

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,319
cadence of 128

44
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,120
each round of gift

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,760
128 consists of three steps

46
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,360
in the sub sales operation an invertible

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,080
4-bit s-box named cs is applied to an

48
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,640
enable of the separate state

49
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,840
next the perm beats operation performs a

50
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,319
bit permutation operation on the

51
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,680
separate state

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,440
at last the adron k operation includes

53
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,760
adding the round k and the round

54
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,519
constant

55
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,000
in this figure we only illustrate the

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,400
piece that should be axled with the

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
round k

58
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,319
as adding the round constant does not

59
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,518
alter validity of text in the paper

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
the most important steps in differential

61
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,720
and linear attacks are offending

62
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,560
distinguishers activating random

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,400
cryptanalytic properties

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,440
in this work we explored an automatic

65
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,640
method based on boolean satisfaction

66
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,959
problem always it said

67
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,280
to accomplish the set the search of

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,000
linear distinguishers

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,480
the set problem is a problem of

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,200
determining whether there exists an

71
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,720
evaluation for the binary variables such

72
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,879
that the value of the given boolean

73
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,680
formula equals one

74
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,799
boolean formula can be converted into an

75
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,680
equivalent formula in conjunctive normal

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,120
form

77
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,000
each disjunction is called a clause

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
each cig can be a variable a constant of

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,840
the negation of a

80
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,760
variable

81
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,640
since almost all exciting set solver

82
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,720
accept boolean formulas in cnf as inputs

83
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,200
so the distinguished certain problem

84
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,478
should be specified with cni formulas

85
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,320
benefiting from the simple but elegant

86
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,759
structure of gift 128

87
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,479
describing the propagation of the linear

88
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,680
mask inside the cipher boils down to

89
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,160
tracing the propagation of the linear

90
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,120
mask across the x-box

91
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,320
we donate x and y is the input and

92
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,520
output masks of the xbox

93
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
to encode the absolute value of the

94
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,000
correlation we employ two boolean

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,680
variables epsilon 0 and epsilon 1 so

96
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,960
that's the sum summation of them equals

97
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,400
this value

98
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,360
next we define a 10-bit volume function

99
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,720
f look like this and simplify the

100
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,120
expression with the off-the-shelf

101
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,080
software logic freddy

102
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,360
then we get a set of boolean formula

103
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,160
that precisely depicts the relation

104
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,600
among x

105
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,199
y epsilon 0 and epsilon 1

106
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,759
aside from tracking the propagation of

107
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,240
linear mass inside the cipher

108
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,720
the set problem should clarify the

109
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,560
correlation of the targeted linear trial

110
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,039
suppose they intend to search for the

111
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,320
iron trio with the absolute value of the

112
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,680
correlation in less than 2 to the minor

113
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,440
psi

114
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,479
let epsilon kij be the auxiliary

115
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,240
variable regarding the jss box in the

116
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
esrons

117
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,039
then the very valid linear trial should

118
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,759
satisfy this condition

119
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,160
this inequality constraint can be

120
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,840
converted into a sequence of boolean

121
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,919
expressions with the sequential encoding

122
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,479
method

123
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,560
now let's move on to the linear

124
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,720
cryptanalysis of gift cofb

125
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,280
if cofb is an aead that

126
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,479
instantiates the combined feedback mode

127
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,720
with gift

128
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,440
128

129
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,319
the input of the encryption algorithm

130
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,960
include a

131
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,319
128 bit k

132
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,479
unknowns associated data and message

133
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,160
the output uh several texts say under

134
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,840
128 feet tag

135
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,240
the uk function in the figure are

136
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,360
referred to as the cipher gift 128.

137
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,160
the ciphertext generating phase it

138
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,880
explodes the feedback function g

139
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,560
which is a linear function over the

140
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,880
108 bit

141
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,560
input we target the encryption function

142
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,400
in the message processing phase

143
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,319
highlighted in red

144
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,520
the property of the primitive puts some

145
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,479
restrictions on the linear approximation

146
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,880
in the linear attack

147
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,840
firstly since the designers claim 64-bit

148
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,039
ndcpa security under the non-respecting

149
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,720
scenario the data complexity of a valid

150
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,400
attack on gift cofb should be zero land

151
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,840
lower than 2 to the 64.

152
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,360
secondly

153
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,560
note that the most significant 64 bit of

154
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,000
the input

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,960
of the uk function are masked by the

156
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,879
value l and l depends on the value of n

157
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,000
and k

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,319
and that is not unknown

159
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,199
therefore the verification of the linear

160
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,919
relation should be irrelevant with the

161
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,520
most significant 64 bits

162
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,759
to accomplish the search of linear

163
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,039
approximation fulfill these restrictions

164
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,000
they attempt to encode it with boolean

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
equations

166
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,640
we create a specialized set problem

167
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,679
targeting the conditional linear trio

168
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,679
to begin with given that gift 128

169
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,880
achieves full division after four rounds

170
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,680
we conjecture the maximum number of

171
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,000
rounds appended before the linear

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,399
distinguisher in the attack

173
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,320
is 3 regarding the three runs extended

174
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,040
before the linear approximation

175
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,399
we introduce extra variables to locate

176
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,279
the bits involved in verifying the

177
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,200
linear relation

178
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,640
according to the functionality the extra

179
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,360
boolean equation in the specialized set

180
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,600
problem can be divided into three parts

181
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,480
the first part identifies the necessary

182
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,959
bits for the calculation of the linear

183
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,240
relation

184
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,360
the second part ensures the irrelevance

185
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,279
with the most significant 64 input bits

186
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,480
the last part connects the extended runs

187
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,839
with a linear trio

188
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,560
now we look into some details

189
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,519
for each xbox in the three appended

190
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,839
rounds they introduce four billion

191
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,440
variables mu zero rule to mu 3 to

192
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,160
signify whether the four values of the

193
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,880
input bits should be known for checking

194
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,079
the linear relation respectively

195
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,040
if the value of x i should be known for

196
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,079
the verification of the linear relation

197
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,560
mu n is set as 1.

198
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,200
likewise we utilize four boolean

199
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,279
variables new 0 to nu3 to stand for

200
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,680
whether the four values of the output

201
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,480
piece are the necessary bits for

202
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,839
calculating the linear relation

203
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,440
since the xbox is a nonlinear operation

204
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,240
the four values of the input bits must

205
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,600
be known if any of the four output bits

206
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,079
turns into necessary bits

207
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,120
last

208
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,079
the newly included variables should

209
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,560
satisfy this constraint

210
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,360
and it can be converted into boolean

211
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,160
expressions with a similar approach used

212
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
for the x-box

213
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,040
this expression constitutes the first

214
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,920
part of extra boolean equations in the

215
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,839
specialized set problem

216
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,680
then donate new kij and new kij the

217
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,040
variables for the js box in the as

218
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,360
appended round before the linear

219
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,120
approximation

220
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,760
to make sure that the evaluation of the

221
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,480
linear relation does not rely on the

222
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,480
most significant 64-bit of the input

223
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,000
we should append 64 equations to the set

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,120
problem

225
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,160
these equations are the second part of

226
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,079
extra boolean equations

227
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,079
now suppose that the input mask of the

228
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,360
linear trio in the original set problem

229
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,200
is simple symbolically represented as a

230
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,760
0 rule to a127

231
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,959
the value of the piece masked base v a i

232
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,320
e cos1 should be known so that we can

233
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,639
estimate the validity of the linear

234
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,920
relation

235
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,360
thus to establish the connection between

236
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,920
the affects three runs and the linear

237
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,920
trio they generate

238
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,279
256 equations

239
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,399
these equations form the third part of

240
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,360
extra boolean equations

241
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,440
we apply the specialized set problem to

242
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,200
assess the search of linear

243
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,240
distinguisher for give cofb

244
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,360
in the test phase we observed that the

245
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,399
absolute value of the correlation for

246
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,040
the optimal 11 round linear trial

247
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,079
regarding gift 128

248
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,959
is 2 to the minus 31

249
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,200
giving the linear heart effect of gift

250
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,360
128 is relatively big

251
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,240
we get that the data requirement for

252
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,680
linear attacks with 11 round

253
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,600
approximations may be larger than 2 to

254
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,120
the 6a4

255
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,680
thus we utilize turnaround linear

256
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,200
approximations

257
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,560
to realize k recovery attacks for 380aad

258
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,120
the maximum absolute value of the

259
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,440
correlation for the turnaround linear

260
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,800
trio is 2 to the minus 26

261
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,279
with a neutral satisfying the

262
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,639
specialized set problem if the absolute

263
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,519
value of the objective correlation for

264
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,120
the linear trio is fixed as 2 to the

265
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,360
minus 26 or 2 to the minus 27

266
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,160
when the objective correlation is set

267
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,040
set as 2 to the minus 28.

268
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,079
about 70 thousands of linear trials are

269
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,399
returned by the set solar

270
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,440
but none of them can be used to launch

271
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,199
the 16 round attacks so we lower the

272
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,760
objective correlation of the specialized

273
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,680
set problem to 2 to the minus 29 and

274
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,720
discover more than 400 thousands of

275
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,959
linear trios

276
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,199
the distinguisher is a unique one

277
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,000
achieving the minimum number of gases of

278
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,279
kbs

279
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,720
the elp of the linear approximation is 2

280
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,639
to the minus

281
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,639
57.68

282
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,160
the data complexity of the 16 round

283
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,399
attack is 2 to the

284
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,399
62.1

285
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,959
the total time complexity is 2 to 722.8

286
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,199
the memory complexity is roughly 2 to

287
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,959
the 47 and the success probability is

288
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,920
about 80 percent

289
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,920
now we look at the linear cryptanalyze

290
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,160
of hyena

291
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,399
hyena is the instantiation of the hybrid

292
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,880
feedback based encryption with

293
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
authentication mode of operation with

294
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,040
the sephora gift 128.

295
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,000
the input of the encryption algorithm

296
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
includes

297
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,519
128 bit k

298
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,759
96 bit nonce

299
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,720
associated data and message

300
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,360
the outputs are cipher text c and 128

301
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,880
bit tag

302
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,680
the uk function in the figure i referred

303
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,399
to as the cipher gives 128.

304
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,600
the ciphertext generating phase explores

305
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,519
a linear feedback function

306
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,199
we target the encryption functions in

307
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,600
the message processing phase highlighted

308
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,720
in red there are some restrictions on

309
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,440
the linear approximation in the linear

310
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,639
attack

311
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,759
under the nonce respecting scenario the

312
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,040
designer claims that for a valid attack

313
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,759
the data requirement should be less than

314
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,040
2 to the

315
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,199
64 and the term complexity is bounded by

316
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,000
2-128

317
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,839
beyond that hyena also created a 64-bit

318
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,120
unknown value data before they associate

319
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,440
data processing phase

320
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,680
so the verification of the linear

321
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,160
relation should be irrelevant with the

322
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,480
least significant 64 bit

323
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,399
to accomplish the search of linear

324
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,680
approximation fulfill these restrictions

325
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,799
we replace the second part of extra

326
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,599
boolean equation in the specialized set

327

problem

328
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,280
the turnaround distinguisher is a unique

329
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,760
one achieving the minimum number of

330
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,000
gases of kbs

331
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,480
the linear correlation of the dominating

332
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,959
trio is 2 to the minus 28 and the elp of

333
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,640
the linear approximation is 2 to the

334
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,280
minus 55.36

335
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,480
the data complexity of the 16 round

336
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,559
attack is 2 to the 61.51

337
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,280
the total time complexity is 2 to the

122

339
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,480
the memory complexity is roughly 2 to

340
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,000
the 52 and the success probability is

341
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,360
about 80

342
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,760
80 percent

343
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,320
next we introduce the analyze on sunday

344
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,320
gift

345
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,120
sunday gift is a family of aead that

346
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,160
explodes the skin sandy with gift 128

347
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,960
as the underlying block server

348
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,400
the encryption algorithm takes as input

349
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
of

350
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,679
128 bit k

351
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,880
and associate data and message

352
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,600
the output of the encryption is a cipher

353
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,879
text and a tag

354
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,160
unlike the case in previous two

355
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,840
primitive

356
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,880
there because there is no limitation as

357
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,440
the input of the k function

358
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,160
they proposed to attach four rounds and

359
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,320
three rounds before and after the

360
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,240
distinguisher

361
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,799
the ten round extinguisher is a unique

362
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,840
one achieving the minimum number of gas

363
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,760
sub k bits

364
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,400
the linear correlation of the dominating

365
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,160
trio is also 2 to the minus 28 and the

366
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,280
elp of the linear approximation

367
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,200
is 2 to the minus

368
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,200
55.36

369
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,160
the data complexity of the 17 round

370
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,559
attack is 2 to the 61.51

371
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,280
the total time complexity is 2 to the

372
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,280
123.38

373
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,240
and the memory complexity is roughly 2

374
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,760
to the 49. the success probability is

375
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,840
also about 80 percent

376
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,280
in the last part we introduced the

377
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,639
cryptanalytic result on gift 128.

378
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,360
we intend to attach four rounds and

379
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,440
three runs before and after the

380
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,039
distinguisher

381
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,720
all the 8192

382
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,840
optimal 19-round trios with correlation

383
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,400
2 to the manners 59 cannot derive 26

384
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,840
from the text so we gradually reduce the

385
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,000
objective correlation

386
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,240
when the objective correlation is

387
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,159
reduced to 2 to the minor 6a2 it finds a

388
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,240
unique distinguisher attaining the

389
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,840
minimum number of gas subcapes

390
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,200
the elp of the linear approximation is 2

391
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,080
to the minus 123.11

392
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,960
after a careful investigation we notice

393
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,240
that the time complexity of the 26th

394
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,720
round attack goes beyond 2 to

395
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,440
728

396
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,320
thus we finally launched a 25 round

397
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,120
linear attack with a newly identified

398
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,320
19-round linear approximation

399
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,400
the data complexity of the 25 round

400
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,440
attack is 2 to

401
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,440
724 point

402
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,000
the total time complexity is 2 to the

403
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
126.77

404
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,640
the memory complexity is roughly 2 to

405
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,400
the 96 and the success probability is

406
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,039
about 50 percent

407
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,600
note that the success probability of the

408
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,720
attack can be improved by repeating the

409
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,520
entire work with a new group of

410
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,840
plaintext ciphertext pairs

411
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,799
now we finish all the contents in the

412
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,080
paper and give a conclusion

413
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,799
in this work firstly we create

414
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,520
specialized set problems for the search

415
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,559
of linear distinguishers coordinate with

416
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,320
the attack setting

417
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,960
this is method they improved linear

418
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,200
attacks on gift cofp and sunday gift

419
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,840
they proposed the first script analytic

420
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,080
result on hyena

421
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,559
also they provide improved linear

422
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,480
attacks on gift 128.

423
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,799
that's all for the presentation thank

424
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,440
