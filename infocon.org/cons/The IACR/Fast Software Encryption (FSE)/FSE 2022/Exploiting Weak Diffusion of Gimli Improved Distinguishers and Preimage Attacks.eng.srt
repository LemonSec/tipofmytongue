00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,279
hello everyone the title of this talk is

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,680
exploiting weak the feeling of gamely

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,000
improved distinguishes and pre-immediate

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,040
attacks

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,599
this is a joint work with takano isobae

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,679
and the willimer

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,320
this is an overview of this talk so i

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,640
will first describe gimli and then

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,240
describe our text finally

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,760
this talk will be summarized

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,400
gimli is a cross-platform implementation

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,480
designed by bursting at ho at chess 2017

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,320
it was one of the second round

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,239
candidates in a nice lightweight

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,320
cryptography competition

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,079
two notable features of the gaming

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,600
implementation

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,160
low diffusion and high symmetry

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,280
this is the gimli state it can be viewed

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,920
as a three times four two dimensional

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,960
array

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,480
and each

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,680
element in the array is a 32-bit state

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,000
word

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,680
the total number of runs of the gimli

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,880
implementation is 24 and the sequence of

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,680
rotations for the game implementation is

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,040
specified here so as the first round

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,080
the sp operation small swap operation

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,000
add one constant operation will be

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,280
applied

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,080
at the second round only sp operation

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,119
will be applied at the third round

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,600
the sp and the big swap operation will

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,240
be applied as the first round

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,960
again only the sp operation will be

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,079
applied

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,759
after repeating

39
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,560
such

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,000
operations for 6 times we obtain the 24

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,799
round permutation

42
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,280
this is the summary of related attacks

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,920
on gimli in the classical setting

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,640
as you can see from this table we can

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,960
construct a distinguisher

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,240
on 18 round gimli with time complexity

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,119
2.

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,399
in addition we can improve the best

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,200
foreign distinguisher

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,679
by a factor of 2 to the 12. in addition

51
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,800
the premier attacks on gimli hearts and

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,680
the gimli xof-128

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,400
can reach up to 5 and 9 runs

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
respectively

55
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,760
so all the results are the best as far

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,120
as we know

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,200
first i will describe the 18 round

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,959
distinguisher

59
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,640
let us consider the state a9 which is

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,160
the state of nairon gimli

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,920
so we consider a state a nice at that

62
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,879
the

63
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,200
second column and the first column are

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,319
the same

65
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,080
for the

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,480
first column and the third column they

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,920
only defer as the first as the first row

68
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,200
and the

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,400
the testify the condition that the the

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,480
xo is exactly the used run constant

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,599
then

72
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,879
at the state a8 we can find that the

73
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,840
third column so this the third column

74
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,239
will be equal to the first column and

75
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,319
the fourth column will be equal to the

76
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,319
second column

77
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,200
such symmetry will not be destroyed by

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,319
the inverse of sp and the big swap

79
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,000
operation so at the state a5

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,879
we still have such symmetry

81
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,040
however due to the addron constant

82
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,000
addition and the small swap operation at

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,760
the state a4

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,760
we can only have that the first column

85
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,560
is equal to the third column

86
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,159
again

87
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,280
such a property will not be destroyed by

88
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,599
the inverse of sp and

89
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,760
big swap operation so as the state a1

90
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,000
so we still have the first column will

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,720
be equal to the third column then at the

92
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,360
state 8.5

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,040
we can have the

94
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,480
the so so

95
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,000
so for the

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,799
last two rows of the first column and

97
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,599
the third column they are still equal

98
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,799
however for the input a zero

99
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:13,680
uh

100
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,440
we we we we no longer have such a strong

101
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,199
symmetry

102
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,798
however we can

103
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,000
by studying some property of the sp box

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,680
we can find that there are still some uh

105
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,040
bits

106
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,680
here there are still some identical bits

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,560
in the first column and the third column

108
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,720
so later i will give the details

109
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,199
then we trace the symmetry forwards from

110
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,520
a knife for four rounds

111
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,639
as the state a 10 we can only have that

112
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,600
the second column is equal to the fourth

113
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,720
column however uh

114
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,800
the third column and the first column

115
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,520
will not be equal anymore

116
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,840
then at the state a12

117
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,960
we still have the second column is equal

118
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,800
to the fourth column while there is no

119
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,720
such beautiful symmetric property

120
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
between the third column and the first

121
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,919
column

122
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,000
then at the state

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,960
a 13 we can only have

124
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,759
for the so we can only have that at the

125
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,039
last two rows of the

126
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,960
second color and the first column they

127
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,440
are identical

128
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,960
so you can if we further start a 14 we

129
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,440
can find that we completely lose such

130
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,039
beautiful symmetric properties

131
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,400
so

132
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,160
how to

133
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,720
find a way to make

134
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,199
such a symmetric property

135
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,120
hold for as many runs as possible

136
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,199
let us consider a state b9 which is

137
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,639
obtained by swapping the words

138
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,840
at the

139
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,560
first and the third columns of the first

140
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,960
row of a9

141
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,440
in this way we can find that

142
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,960
as the state b13 the

143
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,840
second column b13 will be equal to the

144
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,639
fourth column of a13 and the fourth

145
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,280
column b13 will be equal to the second

146
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,360
column of a13

147
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,400
then we are interested

148
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,440
in the

149
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,600
evolution of the symmetry between 8 13 b

150
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,759
13 for more rounds

151
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,720
we can find that as the state b14 a14

152
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,440
a15 b15 a16 b16

153
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,000
uh such a such symmetry will be

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,199
preserved

155
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,280
then at the states

156
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,280
at the state a17 and the b17

157
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,680
for the last two rows

158
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,319
as the first call as the second column

159
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,400
and the fourth column

160
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,280
uh

161
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,840
such a property will still be

162
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,560
preserved so our aim is to study whether

163
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,560
we are still some uh symmetric beats in

164
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,400
18 in a 18 and a ba 18.

165
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,639
we find that there are still some

166
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,840
deterministic symmetry between a18 and

167
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,000
b18

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,800
also we have some deterministic symmetry

169
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,400
in a0 and b0 respectively so we

170
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,960
immediately obtain a distinguisher for

171
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,360
18-round game libremutation with time

172
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
complexity 2.

173
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,000
this is

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
the illustration of the compilation

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,840
between our distinguisher and other

176
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,599
distinguishers

177
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,120
in a world in our distinguisher we not

178
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,720
only started the

179
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,440
evolution of the symmetry for one state

180
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
but also study the

181
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,199
evolution of the symmetry between

182
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,960
different states

183
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,440
then we describe our improved fluorine

184
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,960
distinguisher at asia curve 2020 a

185
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
foreign distinguisher on the gimli

186
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,680
permutation with time complexity 2 to

187
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,960
the 64 was proposed constructing such a

188
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,919
distinguisher consists of two steps as

189
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,440
the first step

190
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,199
we need to search for a solution for

191
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,840
abcdef such that the second column and

192
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,360
the first column of a24 are the same the

193
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,759
time complexity of this phase is 2 to

194
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,199
the 32

195
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,759
then as the second step

196
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,759
we need to ensure

197
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,080
the first column and the third column of

198
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,240
a0 are the same

199
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,440
this is equivalent to the condition a x

200
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,679
equals to a y which holds with

201
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,640
probability 2 to the minus 32

202
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,279
so the time complexity to construct such

203
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,640
a foreign distinguisher is 2 to the

204
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,440
32 plus 32 equals to 2 to the third

205
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,279
to the 64.

206
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,160
our idea to improve the full long

207
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,240
distinguisher is to relax the

208
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,279
constraints on the symmetry in a0

209
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,160
in other words we will keep step 1 the

210
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,000
same while changing step two

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,720
our critical observation is that

212
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,440
when there are w's consecutive bits

213
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,920
between a s and a y

214
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,839
which holds with

215
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,880
which hold with time which hold with

216
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,440
probability two to the minus w

217
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
there will be

218
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,160
three times w plus two symmetric

219
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,399
relations between the

220
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,880
third column and the first column of a

221
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,519
a0

222
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,120
in this way we can find such an input

223
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,760
output pair with time complexity 2 to

224
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,640
the 32 plus w while for random dista for

225
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,920
random permutation finding such an input

226
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,640
output pair will require time complexity

227
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,440
2 to the 3w plus 2.

228
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,920
so by choosing we as 20 we can we

229
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,320
reconstruct a valid distinguisher with

230
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,360
term complexity due to the 52.

231
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,680
now i will describe the

232
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,160
premiere text on gimli harsh

233
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,399
the general procedure can be divided

234
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,560
into three phases as the first phase

235
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,600
we need to find a valid inner part of

236
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,480
sh0 that that it can match the outer

237
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,640
part of sh1

238
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,839
as the second phase

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,640
our m is to utilize the degree of

240
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,440
freedom provided by the message words

241
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,079
specifically we will randomly choose a

242
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,760
value for m3 m4 to obtain a value for

243
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,320
the inner part of s2

244
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,279
then as the third phase our aim is to

245
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,480
match a valid inner part with two blocks

246
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,000
specifically find find we our aim is to

247
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,320
find a valid value for m

248
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,320
0 of m 0 and 1 such that the inner part

249
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,240
of s2 can be matched for the first phase

250
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,720
of the premature attack on fire run game

251
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,040
rehash

252
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,720
our aim is to find a valid inner part of

253
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,600
sd row such that it can match the output

254
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,040
part of

255
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,480
s5 specifically we mean

256
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,000
so this can be divided into three steps

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,920
at step one we guess we randomly choose

258
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,160
2 to the 64

259
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,000
rand values for these four state words

260
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,880
then

261
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,480
we can compute

262
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,839
these state words these state words

263
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,120
these state words these state words and

264
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,560
these state words then at step two

265
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,680
we guess when we randomly choose 2 to

266
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,120
the 64 random uh we randomly choose 2 to

267
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,040
the 64 values for these four state words

268
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,639
and once for each guess we can compute

269
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,839
these state words these state words and

270
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,760
these state words

271
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,360
then we fi we try to do some match

272
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,200
we try to do some match in these 128

273
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,040
bits

274
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,920
and we can expect one match

275
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,360
because because we we have computed 2 to

276
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,320
the 64 uh

277
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,040
possible values for this part

278
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,920
in this direction and we can we also

279
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,680
computed uh one two to the 64 possible

280
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,000
values for these four state words in the

281
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,399
backward direction

282
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,959
after step one and step two

283
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,600
so these values are fixed these values

284
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,079
are fixed so these are fixed these are

285
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,880
fixed these are fixed these are fixed

286
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
these are also fixed these are also

287
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,160
fixed these are also fixed our aim is to

288
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,120
find a valid solution for

289
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,399
these four

290
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,079
uh state words

291
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,040
and they can be

292
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,760
find in a very similar way

293
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,480
with time complexity due to the

294
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,200
64.

295
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,600
then for the

296
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,079
third phase of the fire run premier

297
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,360
attack

298
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,320
the aim is to find a solution for the

299
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,240
first two message blocks m0 and m1

300
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,680
the general idea is very similar to the

301
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,279
to that of the first phase so we mainly

302
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,920
exploit the low diffusion of the run

303
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,199
function specifically by guessing only a

304
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,480
few state worlds state worlds we can

305
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,120
compute some state words after many

306
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,399
rounds

307
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,240
this is the critical observation

308
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,040
so you can see the details in our paper

309
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,800
uh so in this way so in

310
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,600
after evaluating the time complexity for

311
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,160
the two phases we can find that the

312
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,639
total time complexity of the foul run

313
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,000
premier attack is 2 to the 96 and the

314
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,480
total memory complexity of the

315
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,560
pre-media attack is 2 to the 65

316
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,000
by using the

317
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,079
general attack procedure to find the

318
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,959
prematures and a useful property for the

319
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,959
two-run sp box

320
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,720
we could find we could amount a

321
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,279
practical to run a premier attack on

322
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,440
gimli harsh

323
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,079
and this is a message which can lead to

324
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,720
an audio state for two round dimly hash

325
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,519
to support the correctness of our attack

326
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,399
finally i will describe the neuron

327
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,800
pre-media attack on gimli xof-128

328
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,560
the only difference is that the

329
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,199
difference is that we need to set some

330
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,399
conditions on the second row of

331
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,279
s0 to control the diffusion in other

332
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,480
words

333
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,839
we need we need these conditions to

334
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,720
allow us to compute some state worlds by

335
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,480
only guessing

336
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,639
a few state words of s0

337
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,000
the general ideas indeed were similar to

338
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,199
the premier attack on gimli harsh

339
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,519
that's specifically by

340
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,320
by guessing only a few state words we

341
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,920
compute some

342
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,120
state words after several

343
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,519
rounds

344
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,360
so i will not explain the details

345
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,480
the total time complexity of our neuron

346
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,199
premature attack on gimli xo os 128 is 2

347
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,240
to the 104 and the total memory

348
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,680
complexity is to to the 70.

349
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,800
in summary the symmetry and load viewing

350
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,560
are the weaknesses of the gaming

351
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,040
permutation and they couldn't and they

352
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,279
can be exploited to construct powerful

353
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,800
distinguishers

354
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,199
second the low defeating also makes the

355
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,440
divide and conquer method feel real with

356
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,720
the pre-immediate clean and

357
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,079
distinguishing attacks on gimli

358
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,079
third

359
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,040
we constructed an almost practical forum

360
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,440
distinguisher with time complexity 2 to

361
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,279
the 52

362
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,079
at the last our premiere attacks on

363
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,240
gaming hearts and gimli xof-128

364
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,399
could reach up to five and

365
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,040
nine rounds respectively which are the

366
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,240
best attacks as far as we know

367
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,839
that's all thank you
