1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,160
can you hear us online

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,920
yes

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,120
okay good

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,080
yeah so welcome everyone to the ram

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,400
session

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,400
welcome everyone to the ram session of

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,320
this year's fse 2022

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,920
so before we start

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,560
before we start

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,800
i would just like to explain the the

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,439
basic rules of this session

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,079
so previously until yesterday evening

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,399
officers were allowed to submit to talks

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,880
of one up to five minutes in length

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,840
so there are a few special talks like a

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,760
report of the program shares which could

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,000
be longer

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,360
and

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,239
the authors could submit talks in four

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,520
categories

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,360
announcement like announcement of new

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,360
conferences humor

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,840
actual research or they could say just

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,719
say i just want to win a prize

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,960
and remote presentations were actually

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,520
allowed and we got a few remote

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,680
submissions

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,520
the most important rule

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,400
is that we want to honor our hosts

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,560
and we're doing this by allowing only

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,320
greek letters when in math mode

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,600
yeah so

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,840
you could not write a s of x

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,320
of course what you have to do is you

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,439
write

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,439
alpha delta epsilon of k

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,600
what

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,119
sigma yeah sorry

39
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,790
it's about writing not saying yes

40
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,680
[Music]

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,680
but you could also use delta that's not

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,119
it's not forbidden

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,320
just harder so except omicron and delta

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,159
yeah for obvious reasons you should you

45
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,720
should avoid

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,840
and authors who failed to follow this

47
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
basic rule will face terrible

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,680
consequences

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
just like the ones foolish enough to not

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,399
respect the time limit

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,520
for these terrible consequences well you

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,280
will see because some of the authors

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,800
were actually foolish enough not to

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
respect the greek rule so you see what

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,280
happens to them

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,879
and one of the things that could happen

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,520
is that they are downgraded in the least

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,840
to be awarded one of our amazing prizes

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,200
that we're planning to give at the end

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,720
of this rum session

61
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,800
so the prices will be the aristophanes

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,319
price which will be given to the

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,200
funniest talk aristophanes being

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,160
the writer of some comedies

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,040
like in parthenon times

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,879
the electra price which will be given to

67
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,959
the most tragic performance so we don't

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,879
want people to talk about sad stuff but

69
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,640
we want them to talk about it in a very

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,160
tragic and impressive and epic way

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,760
uh which is named after elektra the

72
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,560
character in the greek tragedy and the

73
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,480
odysseus prize which will be given to

74
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,920
the talk with the most expertly

75
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,640
shoehorned mythological references named

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,440
of course after odysseus the inventor of

77
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,599
the trojan horse which was the

78
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,599
inspiration from my actual talk earlier

79
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,599
today

80
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,440
however as you will see in the next

81
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,040
slide there was a slight conflict of

82
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,440
interest between some of the chairs and

83
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,280
by which i mean me

84
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,480
and the talks themselves so instead of

85
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,879
deciding ourselves we have decided

86
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,680
to ask the organizers of the event which

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,519
is collocated with this ramp session

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,879
this fsc

89
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,239
thing

90
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,840
and they have kindly agreed to be this

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,000
council of the wise ones because we

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
trust their wisdom from what we could

93
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,879
see so far so christina italia and bart

94
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,920
the young

95
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
will be

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,720
those who decide who gets the prices

97
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
as for the prices

98
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,440
it's going to be pizzagorus cups

99
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,000
so the best ranked uh

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,440
speakers will get to choose exactly

101
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,560
which ones they get because we have

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,720
slight variations

103
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,400
but now you might wonder what is a

104
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,239
pitagorus cup because obviously it's not

105
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,519
just like

106
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,959
cup it has to have some special

107
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,519
functionality and the way they work is

108
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,360
illustrated by this picture which i

109
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,799
obviously did not do myself understood

110
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,480
from wikipedia

111
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,040
if you feel it too much it completely

112
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,200
empties itself

113
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,879
so we thought it was a fitting symbol

114
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,519
that once they have uh the the winners

115
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,639
have reached the

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,440
apex of their career as uh being awarded

117
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,199
a price at the ram session that they do

118
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,199
not become too greedy that if they bask

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,120
too much in the glory of this of this

120
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,440
event they might lose everything

121
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,520
like a memento mori it's mediterranean

122
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,280
but the wrong type so went with this

123
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,000
with this one instead

124
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,520
um and now some statistics yes so

125
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,240
we received 12 submissions and we are

126
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,720
glad to say that we have a acceptance

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,800
rate of 100 so

128
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,720
we will see 12

129
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,400
talks

130
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,880
and two of them are online and 10 of

131
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,000
them are given in place

132
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,120
so several authors chose multiple topics

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,080
yeah so it does not add up to 12

134
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,840
but actually

135
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,720
announcement and research are the most

136
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
most talks but some actually some want

137
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,759
just to chase the price so we let's see

138
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,759
if they will actually get the price in

139
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,840
the end

140
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,360
and the average length of the talk is

141
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
five minutes so there were some talks

142
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,479
that are longer yeah as i said before

143
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,680
yeah so

144
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,919
enjoy

145
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,950
and so we're according on stage

146
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,160
[Applause]

147
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
please make sure if

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,080
you're the next talk in the session to

149
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,360
already come up

150
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,960
on stage and wait there so we do not

151
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
have a lot of delay

152
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,400
okay thank you very much so uh

153
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,560
as on behalf of the program chairs i

154
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,639
would like to

155
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,479
tell you a bit on

156
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,880
how the papers for this conference uh

157
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,759
fsc i mean were selected apparently it's

158
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,160
not a completely random process

159
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,080
um so

160
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,479
i assume that most of you know that

161
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,840
since uh 2016

162
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,280
fse

163
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,520
operates in a hybrid

164
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,400
journal conference model and basically

165
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,039
the journal is called the task it's an

166
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,319
open access journal it is published by

167
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,520
bokum

168
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,720
university

169
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,000
and it is indexed by several important

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,520
databases and

171
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,440
selected for inclusion

172
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,080
and in the web of science

173
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,720
so the review cycles

174
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,759
is rather rapid so we have a four issues

175
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,240
per year which uh

176
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,400
basically means we have a deadline every

177
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,440
three months and the decision is given

178
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,280
after two months

179
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,840
and the decision types are journal

180
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,160
styles so we have uh basically the

181
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,479
standard accept and reject but also we

182
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,599
have revisions and this allows us to uh

183
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,240
to actually improve the quality

184
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,840
of the papers

185
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,720
during the review process and we also

186
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,160
welcome

187
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
sok papers

188
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,758
addendum and errata papers

189
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,520
okay so this basically

190
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,160
gives you the original uh plan for

191
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,840
fse so

192
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,080
in

193
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,400
2021 we were supposed to have uh

194
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,240
fse um

195
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,360
but

196
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,759
yeah so it was uh

197
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,440
in this fsc

198
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,759
we were supposed to present task issues

199
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,560
2020.2

200
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,840
3 and 4

201
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,360
and the task

202
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,440
2021

203
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,720
issue one

204
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,800
unfortunately due to covid so fsc

205
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,240
2021 did not happen

206
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,199
um

207
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,080
and

208
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,400
the first two issues that were supposed

209
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
to be presented

210
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,360
at 2021 actually were presented the year

211
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,400
before

212
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,560
at fsc 2020

213
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,879
which took place online and the last

214
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,879
the final two issues

215
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,479
that were supposed to be presented at

216
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,800
fsc 2021 uh are where or are actually

217
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,840
presented uh at this conference fsc 2022

218
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,400
so all together we have six

219
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,599
task issues uh that are presented uh so

220
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,120
we have 57 papers from this these issues

221
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,640
um and besides these uh uh standard

222
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,479
so-called papers that are presented we

223
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,880
have uh in addition to invite the talk

224
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,159
so or gave his uh talk yesterday and

225
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,839
christian will give his invited talk

226
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,040
tomorrow and uh of course we also have

227
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,880
the rum session and we would like to

228
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,080
thank

229
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,680
christoph and leo for uh taking the

230
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,320
responsibility and the duty of

231
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,320
organizing this uh the swamp session

232
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,279
okay so this uh this uh

233
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,120
chart shows you

234
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,320
um the

235
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,200
statistics uh about the

236
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,560
um

237
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,519
submission and decision statistics uh

238
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,279
for for task

239
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,839
um so you can see on the on the right uh

240
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,680
with the start

241
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,880
uh

242
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
yeah the the start uh

243
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,920
uh rectangles basically show you the

244
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,080
uh the task issues that

245
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,399
uh are presented at this conference and

246
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,279
one thing that is uh rather notable is

247
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,560
that uh um well in the issue

248
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,839
right

249
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,720
before the conference which is 22.1

250
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,880
and this goes back we usually have a

251
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,320
larger

252
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,880
amount of submissions

253
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,920
so all together uh i mean counting these

254
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,080
six issues we had uh

255
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,320
um

256
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,240
213 regular submissions

257
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,800
out of those 27

258
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,120
were accepted which is indeed

259
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,279
uh 57 papers

260
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,480
and um well let's see some interesting

261
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,920
statistic about uh about those uh issues

262
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
so uh

263
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,920
as uh i previously mentioned we have uh

264
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,160
we have and

265
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,719
we can make

266
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,920
revision decision for papers that we

267
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
think

268
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,160
require a revision before

269
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,440
um accepting them to uh for publication

270
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,920
uh so apparently most uh papers that

271
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,160
were given a major review revision

272
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,399
decision uh actually are actually

273
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,160
resubmitted and most of them are

274
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,959
accepted at the end and this should be

275
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,440
uh contrasted with the papers that are

276
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,320
given a reject and resubmit the decision

277
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,640
and this is this decision basically

278
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,360
given to papers uh which shows up some

279
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,240
potential but require too much work to

280
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,880
be given a major revision decision so

281
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,760
actually out of those only one third

282
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,320
are resubmitted to tusk

283
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,560
and um

284
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,040
as i said earlier we actually we we

285
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,240
encourage

286
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,640
submissions of sok addendum and nareta

287
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,320
papers but actually we don't have many

288
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
of these and specifically we did not

289
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
receive any sok paper

290
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,200
in the last four issues of

291
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,680
of task

292
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,240
okay so uh all these issues and all

293
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,160
these submissions they require hard work

294
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,720
for reviewing and uh

295
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,480
you know uh

296
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,399
um improving the quality of the

297
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,880
submissions through revisions and

298
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,120
and of course selecting uh those that

299
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,279
will be will appear at uh task and the

300
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,000
for this we have a program committee and

301
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,959

302
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,279
for this fsc where we would like to

303
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,040
actually thank two program committees

304
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,120
because there are six task issues

305
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,079
involved so the program committee of uh

306
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,959

greek

516
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,840
um

517
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,039
and also

518
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,159
we are not in in march when we are the

519
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,840
kappa gamma of uh elf eboli

520
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,400
beta capabilita uh

521
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,600
according to the attic calendar

522
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,280
so first what you can do so the goal is

523
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,400
12 challenges that you can

524
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,559
do as a cryptanalyst or cryptographer

525
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,000
that i think are

526
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,240
very very hard and you can become very

527
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,400
very famous so you can break

528
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,760
it around of the ranged isles lion

529
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,400
you can also

530
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,679
kill

531
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,480
the hydra and all its heads because each

532
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,080
time there is some cryptanalysis on

533
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,480
those constructions and they

534
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,120
can recover and the new arises but you

535
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,000
need uh not to mind the middle layer you

536
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,400
need to cut in the middle layer using

537
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,280
your favorite swords

538
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,480
um

539
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,400
this is uh this is the hardest one it

540
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,799
seems easy but uh

541
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,280
i have a flag a french flag in uh

542
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,320
somewhere in the in paris it's mine and

543
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,400
if we you can get it

544
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,640
it's very very hard but what would be a

545
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,480
crypto contest without to capture the

546
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,840
flag

547
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,340
challenge

548
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,640
[Music]

549
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,200
this one is probably the hardest you

550
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,840
need to win a tita sconus race

551
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,600
against bat

552
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,120
again if you don't know the metric

553
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,320
system of

554
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,840
ancient greek i can't do much for you

555
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,520
you can also shut down

556
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,799
all the birds of lists

557
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,480
um

558
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,919
this one is uh is very very hard also uh

559
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,360
king gregor uh has a invariant inside

560
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,520
this skinny xbox and if you can find it

561
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,200
and exhibit then it's very very good

562
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,679
um there is strings kuznichik and

563
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,720
streambug lyrican are tests and uh they

564
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,880
have a very very nice s-box so if you

565
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,440
can break the both uh

566
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,000
kuznetsic and street book twins and

567
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,679
also it's a very very nice challenge

568
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,679
and also some practical

569
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,480
analysis we have very very

570
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,520
nice

571
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,918
tusk

572
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,760
program chairs

573
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,240
and if you can steal some secret keys

574
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,400
inside the laptop of you

575
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,679
or guyton or the valley choice or

576
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,240
itae will be a very very great

577
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,799
achievement

578
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,640
um also some cryptanalysis against soze

579
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,720
manuka very snug those

580
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,480
very famous pet of and a wise wise pet

581
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,240
of iron because it's kind of the queen

582
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,200
of

583
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,159
many amazons

584
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,559
and uh also you can clean the

585
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,480
cleanup if you don't know the challenges

586
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,520
of accuracy and you you definitely know

587
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,080
how this refers to if you can clean the

588
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,919
weekly allied stuff then

589
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,840
i think i can upload you

590
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,080
again the cube

591
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,279
not an apple but a golden cube

592
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,120
up to my knowledge cube as a three

593
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
dimension so if you can attack a cipher

594
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,440
with only a three dimensional cube

595
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,200
that would be a very very great

596
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,559
achievement

597
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,120
and finally

598
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,400
bring back the

599
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,720
hound with three heads a50 a51 and a52

600
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,120
from l so the goal now is the last one

601
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,960
and i think it's the hardest one you

602
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,159
have to make a51 secure by just

603
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,600
adding one

604
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,480
logical gate

605
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,600
that's all thank you

606
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,000
okay the

607
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,559
next stock

608
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,039
is by climax and the speaker afterwards

609
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,520
is nicola david so please stay alarmed

610
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,480
already

611
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,320
and clements is talking about old

612
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,880
alliances back

613
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,640
so thank you for the introduction so

614
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,080
yeah i'm going to present a joint work

615
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,400
with the leopard and wesley palischko so

616
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,880
i'm sorry this is not a funny talk

617
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,159
um so our work is entitled all because

618
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,320
um at the time of conception wesleyan

619
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
was still part of scotland and leo and

620
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,559
me were in france so we joined forces to

621
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,279
design new translation hash function

622
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,240
based on the butterfly structure because

623
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,760
let me remind you that we are in a

624
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,919
context of emerging uses and symmetric

625
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,279
cryptography

626
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,360
i mean new protocols such as uranolith

627
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,880
proof have highlighted the need to

628
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,960
minimize the number of multiplication

629
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,559
performed by the primitive in large

630
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,919
final fields

631
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,840
and these correspond to the opposite of

632
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,440
what is usually done

633
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
i mean instead of using operation and

634
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,679
small field we use operation on big

635
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,480
field f row where rho is either a power

636
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,799
of two or a prime number

637
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,120
so classical algorithms such as ies for

638
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,720
example are inappropriate in this

639
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,039
context and we need to design new

640
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,640
primitives

641
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,200
so what were the goal of our primitives

642
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,480
so first

643
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,400
we wanted to design an algorithm that

644
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,720
worked well across proof system and not

645
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,640
only a specific one

646
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,799
we also aim to limit our reliance on

647
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,799
federally generated components to use

648
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,760
both implementation and cryptanalysis

649
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,360
and we also wanted two types of

650
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,279
algorithm i mean a classical sponge

651
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,000
function but also a compression function

652
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,520
for machl tree

653
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,840
and finally we'll see wanted very simple

654
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,399
principle and simple run function that

655
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,240
could apply for all our algorithm

656
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,360
because all is a big family

657
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,039
so i won't have time to go into detail

658
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,880
during this translation but let me just

659
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,640
introduce the key concept behind whole

660
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,360
namely this is equivalence

661
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,440
so two functions are assisted equivalent

662
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,279
if there exists enough impermutation

663
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,919
such a graph of a function corresponds

664
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,919
to the graph of the other function after

665
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,399
applying different permutation

666
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,760
so we rely on the statistical

667
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,919
equivalence of our permutation to a

668
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,000
simpler one to have a higher degree

669
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,919
evaluation and a lower degree

670
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,360
verification

671
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,200
because a function

672
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,520
admits an efficient verification if it

673
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,120
is this is an equivalent to a function

674
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,479
of a strictly lower degree

675
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,480
so our design is already inspired by the

676
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,080
butterfly structure and a festive

677
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,799
network so we have called it flystell

678
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,120
so then given a tuple of two quality

679
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,000
functions and a permutation we have this

680
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
open fly cell and these cloud physical

681
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,240
that are assisted equivalent

682
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,320
so let me explain the advantages of this

683
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,760
structure

684
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,240
so first if we look at the open fly cell

685
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
you can see that the outputs are high

686
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,720
degree polynomials in the two inputs

687
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,960
viable

688
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,039
then we also because we have the inverse

689
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,320
permutation

690
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,240
and then we also prove that we have a

691
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
low differential uniformity

692
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,919
and this does not increase with the side

693
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,520
of the field which is really important

694
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,360
in our context

695
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,279
and as i've said at the open fly cell is

696
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,720
ceced equivalent to this closed

697
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,799
lifestyle so then we have a local's

698
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,799
verification because we only use

699
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,159
quadratic function

700
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,120
and

701
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,840
permutation of low degree

702
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,360
and then the evaluation is not too

703
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,080
expensive because we evaluate only once

704
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,279
the inverse permutation

705
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,720
so then in fields of characteristic two

706
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,200
um our s box is corresponding to these

707
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,960
three round facial networks with the

708
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,200
cube and its inverse

709
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,919
and for odd characteristic fields

710
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,760
we can use the square as a quadratic

711
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,919
function but the cube is not always a

712
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,039
permutation so we have a marginal s box

713
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,360
and finally as i've said we need two

714
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,200
types of algorithm so the first one is a

715
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,960
classical sponge function

716
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
and the second one is a compression

717
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,279
function for moccal tree and for that we

718
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,320
have a dedicated model i mean with a

719
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,559
linear layer and our flight cell

720
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,919
construction

721
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,200
and then if we have this pair of inputs

722
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,240
we apply a old construction and we get

723
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,880
this pair of outputs and what we return

724
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,360
is the sum of all those four variables

725
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,399
here so that uh from two words we get

726
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,360
only one word uh as outputs

727
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,039
and actually we could apply also this

728
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,640
small two other scheme like possession

729
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,039
so then as antenna one over position to

730
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,960
become protector of attend we hope to do

731
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,279
the same and be more efficient than the

732
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,559
theta

733
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,720
thank you

734
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,200
so in this instance the next to the talk

735
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,360
after this one will be online so please

736
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,559
get ready uh over

737
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,720
the internet

738
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,919
and so the next talk will be given by

739
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,200
nikola david it's about differential

740
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,000
attacks on speedy yes

741
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,960
so differential attacks on speedy so let

742
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,399
me first introduce you to the

743
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,000
protagonist of the day so it won't be

744
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,480
speedy gonzalez but he's more elder

745
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,320
ancestor here spidikus ska our speedy

746
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,600
boy so we can see here his parents so

747
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,279
he's from the the paper the speedy

748
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,679
family of block cipher and he's from uh

749
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,399
that was introduced in chess to 2021.

750
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,559
so speedy is a family of ultra

751
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,720
low latency sp and block cipher that

752
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,279
come in multiple versions so

753
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,799
today we'll be looking at pd 592 and pd6

754
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,159
192

755
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,080
and in both cases both the internal

756
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,679
state and the key are represented by a

757
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,399
matrix of 32 lines and six rows and each

758
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,360
cell represents a bit so that makes us a

759
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,799
total of 182 bits

760
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,279
so what did we do so we worked on

761
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,960
multiple differential attacks on the

762
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
construction

763
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,519
we gave a model to efficiently search

764
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,440
for the best path

765
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,640
and we performed some optimization

766
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,880
technique and we used some

767
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,880
so here is uh a differential so i'll

768
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,559
just give like a few

769
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,760
few notes

770
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,559
so it could be split into three parts or

771
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,840
parts depending on how you want to look

772
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,399
at it and what's really uh what really

773
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,559
helped us uh to mount our attack is that

774
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,039
we have very efficient transition

775
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,960
to the xbox that goes from one bit to

776
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,399
one bit i don't know if we can uh maybe

777
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,559
okay i mean we can see this uh the at

778
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,960
the top and also at the bottom at that

779
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,640
different position and that really help

780
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,360
us

781
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,919
mount an effective attack

782
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,840
so here are just few numbers so we have

783
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,600
the differential probability in the

784
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
middle and the top part and bottom heart

785
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,360
actually have pretty good probability

786
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,679
thanks to this xbox

787
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,159
transition

788
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,519
so here

789
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,279
is a little bit summary on our

790
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,159
complexity so the first uh

791
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,039
table is about a designer security claim

792
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,320
and

793
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
the bottom one is about what we did so

794
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,679
as we can see uh we didn't manage to

795
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,919
like actually uh fully into uh inside

796
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,919
the dns security claim for speedy five

797
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,120
so because of our the data however if we

798
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,279
look at spd6

799
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,840
uh our attack can actually be like

800
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,760
seen as a reduced version of the speedy6

801
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,640
because

802
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,840
in this case

803
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,679
our

804
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,440
both our time and our both our

805
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,880
complexity

806
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,399
we follow the situation the designers

807
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,519
critically

808
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,320
and speaking with designers

809
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,960
they they didn't expect attack to exceed

810
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,039
four rounds yet

811
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,039
we showed a five round attack so

812
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,799
yeah as conclusion this is the first

813
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,360
external attack on speedy

814
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,000
and we've seen that uh yeah for the six

815
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,760
version there is at most uh one round

816
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,600
the security margin and we are working

817
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,960
towards the full run attack both for 5.6

818
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,159
and here is uh okay so he was kind

819
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,039
enough to make a video to illustrate his

820
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,720
results but now i need to make it work

821
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,200
with the zoom yeah because so stop the

822
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,960
sharing

823
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,519
and try to start the video

824
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,360
which was in the

825
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,320
slide repeat

826
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,799
it's on the way bear with us

827
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,040
we should have like a slide you know in

828
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,639
the simpsons they have this drunk guy

829
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,239
standing by the camera

830
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,750
with technical technical issues standby

831
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,320
[Music]

832
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,879
it's much better

833
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,159
but we will play it at the end of the

834
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,760
round session and follow us online we

835
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,159
will post the link somewhere

836
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,839
we appreciate your efforts they might be

837
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,078
rewarded uh we'll see in the end

838
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,359
that might be the tragedy we were

839
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,800
looking for yes

840
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,119
okay

841
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,639
you and this is also a mac computer

842
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,000
which i'm not good with

843
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,280
because otherwise it would be too easy

844
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
anyway

845
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,359
the next talk will be given

846
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,719
online so please uh rock fender are you

847
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,599
here

848
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,520
yeah yeah i'm here cool

849
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,599
so yeah okay can you share your screen i

850
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,280
stop the sharing here

851
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,520
okay

852
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,720
okay yeah the floor is yours

853
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,000
yeah thank you for the introduction uh

854
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,200
so this is a joint work with uh rusty h

855
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,599
macaroon

856
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,880
so uh for s-con uh the current best

857
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,800
phone bomb for five round differential

858
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,760
tree is 78 active s boxes

859
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,480
and uh it starts with 29 active s boxes

860
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,560
in round zero and ends with

861
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,520
30 activist boxes and this was given by

862
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,079
the ascon designers back in

863
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:34,880
uh

864
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,000
2015. uh since then uh there are no uh

865
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,079
efforts to understand whether uh this

866
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,599
bound on active as boxes is tight or not

867
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,880
so

868
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,280
we found a multiple differential trails

869
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,320
with

870
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,520
75 active s boxes of this form

871
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,640
and we also found

872
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,720
another differential trails with 72

873
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,599
active s boxes so basically we improve

874
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,359
the upper bound from

875
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,240
78 to 72 and

876
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,160
still we are not sure whether this uh

877
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,599
bound or

878
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,800
whether this bound of 72 activates

879
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,760
activate this tied or not

880
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,359
so now

881
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,560
considering the

882
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,880
four rounds again uh the best known

883
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,640
differential trail is given by the sql

884
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,480
designers and it has 44 active s boxes

885
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,320
it starts with 23 active responses in

886
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,839
round zero and then

887
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,320
ends at 15 active responses

888
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,160
and in

889
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
and you will see in uh

890
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,480
friday uh fsa uh when one of the talk

891
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,119
headlocker and others they have proved

892
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,359
that for four rounds there are at least

893
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,640
36 active s-boxes but for 36 they could

894
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,640
not found whether there is a trail or

895
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,079
not

896
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,480
and here uh we have found

897
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,119
multiple distinct trails with uh 44

898
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,560
activist boxes

899
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,800
and also for the first time

900
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,920
we find

901
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,079
a differential trail with 43 active s

902
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,119
boxes with this configuration so right

903
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,560
now uh

904
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,200
the bound for four round is between 36

905
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,640
and 42

906
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,760
and

907
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,880
if you want to please close this cap

908
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,320
whether to find this

909
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,760
exact number we only need to check uh

910
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,640
in worst case total power being specific

911
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,440
configurations of activist boxes so we

912
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,800
believe uh this is possible to find the

913
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,560
exit gap

914
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,160
okay yeah that's it thank you

915
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,320
we played

916
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,119
just before the

917
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,160
otherwise he sent it to the us

918
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,760
okay so the next talk will be given by

919
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,800
augustine barbier and to talk afterwards

920
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,359
afterwards by baju so please already be

921
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,480
alarmed and augusta will talk about uh

922
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,400
tutorial on how to earn theoretical

923
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,359
money with practical attacks

924
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,000
yes exactly thank you

925
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,560
so i'm gonna teach you how to earn

926
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,280
theoretical money with practical attacks

927
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,280
i'm augusta barrion and this work is

928
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,680
doing done by uh

929
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,760
clemons boujee getting

930
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,200
and myself

931
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,040
to put you into context the interim

932
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,240
foundation

933
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,839
announced the challenge at eurocrypt

934
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,520
2021

935
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,599
uh that started in november back then

936
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,200
and that finishes in the end of this

937
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,440
year the total money involved in the

938
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,920
challenge is 200 000 euros so if you're

939
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,040
tired of the p equal np problem just try

940
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,119
this

941
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,240
uh there are four hash functions at

942
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,119
stake festel memphis poseidon rescue

943
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,440
prime and reinforced concrete actually

944
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,359
the four of them are arithmetization

945
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,160
oriented so they try to minimize the

946
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,920
number of music communication

947
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,560
for diverse contexts

948
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,119
the versions of the challenge are

949
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,359
drastically reduced versions compared to

950
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,760
the full ciphers so as the attacks

951
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,839
become practicable

952
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,839
some of the attacks

953
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,440
the goal of the challenge for the

954
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,480
diverse

955
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,720
hash functions are to solve the cico

956
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,400
problem constrain input constraint

957
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,760
output problem

958
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,200
which is given a permutation pi find x

959
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,480
and y such that pi of x zero equals y

960
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,240
zero

961
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,720
so we'll see the t i c o problem with a

962
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,599
fester mu c what is festel mipsi it's a

963
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,760
physical network with a round function

964
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,560
being a constant addition another box

965
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,920
which is a cube the cube function

966
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,960
we can

967
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,480
model festal mimsi by setting a variable

968
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,000
to each of the inner states

969
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,640
and to derive equations from the round

970
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,119
function conditions so we have r plus

971
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,680
one equations and air plus one variables

972
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
it's a multivariate polynomial system

973
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,160
which we can solve the grammar basis and

974
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,640
in average the solving time is three to

975
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,520
the omega r where omega is the exponent

976
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,720
of linear algebra so basically it's two

977
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,399
in theory three in practice

978
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,920
the original challenges on festal memsi

979
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,319
were these ones and the second the

980
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,720
second challenge could be attacked in

981
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,760
practice uh using two to the power 43

982
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,040
operations

983
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,920
uh

984
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,640
so this was the last practical uh

985
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,000
versions attackable by grubner basis

986
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,079
however we can do better

987
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,960
so instead of considering a multivariate

988
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,560
polynomial system we can have a

989
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,280
univariate polynomial system by setting

990
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,640
the first wire to x x 0 to x

991
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,200
and y 0 to 0 then we compute

992
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,160
the polynomial p r minus 1

993
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,079
which uh which we want to find a root of

994
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,119
so if we find a root of p r minus 1 we

995
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,440
have a solution of this ico problem and

996
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,839
p r minus 1 is of degree 3 to the n

997
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,040
minus 1.

998
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,560
so the solving time of this is r times 3

999
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,839
to the r log p which is way less than

1000
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,599
solving with grammar basis

1001
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,760
the hardest challenge of the original

1002
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,000
challenges now costs only 2 to the 45.5

1003
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,920
using univariate solve

1004
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,200
compared to the

1005
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,839
105 in

1006
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,040
multivariate so

1007
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,200
basically they're all broken but the

1008
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
challenges were updated after the three

1009
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,760
submissions the three first uh our three

1010
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,560
first submissions

1011
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,839
so now the the easiest challenge is the

1012
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,920
former hardest challenge

1013
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,599
uh

1014
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,319
for poseidon

1015
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,200
we you we used a small trick to gain two

1016
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,079
rounds

1017
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,400
and we could attack three challenges so

1018
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,319
the summary of the situation is this one

1019
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,440
uh

1020
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,599
rescue prime is a bit harder to attack

1021
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,000
because one of their s box has a very

1022
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,359
high degree so the x to x power one

1023
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,520
third

1024
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,400
and so we use granular basis to solve it

1025
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,520
and we break the first challenge

1026
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,520
so great is gonna conclude

1027
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,599
you prefer universe solving to

1028
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,839
multivariate

1029
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,319
solving thank you

1030
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,399
and after that

1031
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,560
okay

1032
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,480
okay thank you dear advisor so

1033
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,359
this

1034
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,280
in this presentation i would like to

1035
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,359
give you a first taste of a practical

1036
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,079
cube attack against non-misused ascon so

1037
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,640
this is the part of the work

1038
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,760
joint work with encounter and leopard

1039
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,640
so for those who don't know ascon

1040
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,560
is primitive which was designed by

1041
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,040
members and former members of the teo

1042
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,319
grads team

1043
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,640
it is the first choice of the kaiser

1044
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,359
competition for lightweight usage and it

1045
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,119
is also one of the finalists in the

1046
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,079
current nist standardization process so

1047
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,040
ascon is a permutation-based

1048
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,359
construction and it uses a duplex sponge

1049
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,960
mode of operation

1050
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,920
and the permutation in ascon is built as

1051
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,560
follows so first of all you have a

1052
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,079
constant addition

1053
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,040
then an xbox live layer a sigma box

1054
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,280
layer in which uh

1055
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,839
the unique s box is applied to each of

1056
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,480
the columns and finally you have a

1057
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,040
linear layer in which five different

1058
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,200
linear permutations are applied

1059
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,560
to the five different rows so in the

1060
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,680
non-smithu setting once the key unknowns

1061
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,480
are fixed once and for all you can go

1062
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,800
through initialization once and you can

1063
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,280
study the state on the dotted line here

1064
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,000
which looks like this so you can control

1065
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,720
the first row and you need to recover

1066
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,920
the four other rows alpha beta gamma and

1067
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,680
phi

1068
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,040
so after

1069
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,240
half around after the first xbox layer

1070
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,440
the the algebraic normal form of the

1071
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,680
of a column is this one and as you can

1072
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,920
see the coefficients in front of the

1073
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,079
variables are different depending on the

1074
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,520
rows

1075
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,720
so in this work we first interested we

1076
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,720
are first interested in the coefficients

1077
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,920
of terms of degree 32 after six rounds

1078
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,480
and they can be expressed as sum of

1079
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,119
products of former coefficients after

1080
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,440
the half around so after the first xbox

1081
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,560
layer

1082
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,040
but what happens if

1083
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,520
the first term in this product

1084
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,680
all come from the first row or the

1085
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,880
fourth row well in that case

1086
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,599
each product will be able to be either

1087
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,599
divisible with

1088
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:20,480
sorry

1089
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,640
will be divisible either by alpha zero

1090
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,319
plus one or

1091
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,480
gamma zero plus five zero plus one and

1092
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,319
in that case you can express the

1093
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,520
coefficients

1094
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,720
like this

1095
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,280
and in the event of alpha zero being

1096
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,160
equal to one and gamma zero plus phi

1097
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,240
zero being equal to one then all the

1098
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,000
coefficients will be able to be

1099
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,079
nullified at the same time and you don't

1100
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,640
you don't expect this kind of behavior

1101
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,599
otherwise so thanks to this we managed

1102
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,440
to recover some of the bits and there is

1103
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,520
two other steps in order to recover the

1104
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,760
remaining bits so in the end

1105
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,560
this is a full state recovery for the

1106
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,119
full 600 encryption of ascon when the

1107
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,520
month is really good

1108
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,079
when the announce is reused a lot it is

1109
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,560
practical and it has been implemented

1110
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,280
and it does not go against uh afghan

1111
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,760
security claims but it is a reminder

1112
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,880
that the announce is not a constraint

1113
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,280
thank you

1114
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,440
okay the next stop will be by patrick on

1115
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,119
the patrick norman on the question

1116
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,240
whether we can uniquely discuss

1117
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,800
yeah thanks for the introduction

1118
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,440
so i would like to advertise a paper

1119
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,560
that will hopefully get published soon

1120
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,640
so it's not out yet

1121
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,400
and we asked ourselves the question if a

1122
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,240
given around function

1123
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,720
can you uniquely decompose it into a

1124
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,960
linear and nonlinear layer

1125
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,839
or

1126
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,359
in other words

1127
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,599
if you know a representation of a round

1128
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,079
function that looks like this is it

1129
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,280
really unique or are you able to

1130
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,680
find a different representation of this

1131
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,119
round function

1132
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:03,920
and

1133
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,400
of course i already hear you say well

1134
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,359
can't you combine multiple s boxes into

1135
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,680
one bigger s-box or

1136
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,760
can't you just

1137
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,200
look at linear equivalent s-boxes

1138
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,440
or just change the order of the s-boxes

1139
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,400
but we don't want to do that we

1140
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,680
want to

1141
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,640
look at uniqueness up to those things

1142
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,800
and um surprisingly

1143
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,680
the

1144
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,200
answer is basically it depends

1145
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,319
so

1146
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,880
in case you you have two s-boxes one

1147
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,400
that has maximal differential uniformity

1148
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,040
and one that's that has a maximal

1149
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,680
linearity then you're actually not able

1150
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,760
to find one unique decomposition

1151
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,760
thanks

1152
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,319
if you plan to go for one minute you

1153
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,160
should ask for five

1154
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,800
let's say but i did didn't i

1155
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,599
you did fit into five

1156
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,880
uh

1157
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,240
[Music]

1158
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,480
so apologies for the lack of

1159
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,559
jokes in this talk so i will try to be

1160
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,640
as quick as possible and get close to

1161
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,960
the three minute limit

1162
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,440
so uh please bear with me and listen to

1163
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,800
a bit about linear crypto analysis or

1164
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,720
more specifically about sunyac recovery

1165
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,040
attacks

1166
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,880
so in inaugural recovery attacks we have

1167
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,480
several different approaches the

1168
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,079
classical one

1169
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,119
has

1170
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,960
time complexity which depends on the

1171
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,440
amount of data and the number of bits of

1172
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,160
key which we guess

1173
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,079
we can also use a distillation phase to

1174
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,839
slightly reduce this time complexity in

1175
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,280
many cases

1176
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,200
and a very popular technique is to use

1177
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,839
the fft or the voice transform

1178
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,000
to obtain

1179
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,720
even lower time complexity however this

1180
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,119
complexity depends on a factor

1181
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,599
which is not as clearly related to uh

1182
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,119
the number of bits of key which we are

1183
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,359
guessing

1184
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,520
this constant uh

1185
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,000
is usually is always larger than the

1186
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,640
amount of bits of key that we guess

1187
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,599
but

1188
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,240
very often it is determined by the

1189
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,760
construction of the round function

1190
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,760
and this is a problem because if we want

1191
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,839
to reduce the time complexity by using

1192
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,599
the key schedule or some other

1193
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,280
dependency within the construction of

1194
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,640
the cipher

1195
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,720
sometimes we obtain the same time

1196
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,240
complexity or almost the same time

1197
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,799
complexity

1198
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,480
so we try to solve this

1199
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,800
and we noted that first we treat the

1200
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,960
round construction as some generic

1201
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,400
boolean function

1202
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,960
which is not the case

1203
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,359
and uh we also treat the world's

1204
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,920
transform as an indivisible block which

1205
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,520
has a fixed time complexity

1206
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,920
so uh for this reason we looked at

1207
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,559
pruning algorithms for

1208
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,480
this fast wash transform

1209
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,160
and we can see that the case in which

1210
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,559
both the non-zero inputs and the desired

1211
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,319
outputs

1212
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,319
are in a fine subspace

1213
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,160
and we find that the time complexity can

1214
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,040
be reduced a lot in fact essentially

1215
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,960
this becomes the new constant

1216
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,359
so if we take the non-serial values in

1217
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,119
the world spectrum and

1218
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,180
place them in

1219
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,000
[Music]

1220
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,920
appropriate fine subspaces then we can

1221
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,160
obtain a much lower

1222
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,520
cost

1223
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,319
to perform the attack

1224
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,040
and as applications we consider the des

1225
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,280
and present with the 128 bit variant

1226
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,440
so for the des

1227
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,079
we obtain a slightly lower

1228
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,480
data complexity and for present we

1229
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,640
obtain the first attack on 29 rounds of

1230
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,480
the total 31 which

1231
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,240
the cypher has

1232
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,240
so thank you very much for listening and

1233
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,919
again i apologize for the lack of jokes

1234
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,159
[Applause]

1235
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,480
just before we can start the music

1236
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,760
so

1237
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,680
we are going to stop the screen sharing

1238
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,599
to play the video that david should have

1239
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,040
posted in the chat i hope he has

1240
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,440
he has okay so i invite people on zoom

1241
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,200
to uh have a look at it we're going to

1242
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,640
the same in the room and after that

1243
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,640
gaeton will take the floor

1244
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,160
to present

1245
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,399
stuff

1246
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,200
yes but are people here ah you mean

1247
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,440
would that work

1248
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,280
well we'll try we'll do some science if

1249
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,359
it explodes i decline uh respond

1250
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:58,078
responsibility

1251
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,680
please

1252
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,520
i require expertise here so

1253
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,200
bear with us

1254
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,440
so people online do you see a youtube

1255
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,040
screen

1256
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,160
yes

1257
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,720
splendid okay so that's what nicola

1258
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,920
wanted to have at the end of his talk

1259
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,440
which was about speedy and how he broke

1260
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,440
it

1261
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,079
well at least the message is clear

1262
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,119
so thank you debbie

1263
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,640
and now for a more classical approach to

1264
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,520
talk giving uh i let i leave the floor

1265
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,040
to

1266
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,240
get on

1267
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,839
we talk about new directions new

1268
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,280
directions in cryptography that's

1269
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,800
ambitious absolutely thank you

1270
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,599
uh

1271
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,839
so yeah i want to talk uh first about

1272
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,000
how we publish so this is moving by

1273
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,119
itself how do you stop it

1274
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,720
like this maybe

1275
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,400
okay

1276
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,440
um

1277
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,440
so i want to talk first about how we we

1278
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,880
publish papers because of course that's

1279
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,240
something important for researchers

1280
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,800
that's how we uh explain our results to

1281
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,640
the community and that's also how we are

1282
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,800
evaluated sometimes and i know that

1283
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,720
getting a paper published in tusk is

1284
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,640
hard we have about a 73 percent

1285
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,559
rejection rate which is

1286
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,960
high so i as a chair i apologize to

1287
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,480
everybody who had a paper rejected i

1288
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,880
know you've worked a lot on it but

1289
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,480
we have to make decisions and sometimes

1290
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,800
we have to reject some papers

1291
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
i know the ramp session has a much lower

1292
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,480
rejection rate of zero percent so that

1293
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,319
could be an alternative but also some

1294
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,240
venues have very high rejection rate

1295
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,160
like the jaw4 journal of universal

1296
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,000
rejection which has a hundred percent

1297
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,280
rejection rate so we're not doing that

1298
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,359
bad with dusk i guess

1299
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,280
the good news is that the iacr is

1300
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,359
working on a new publication venue

1301
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:16,880
i don't know how many of you have heard

1302
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,040
about this project can you can you do a

1303
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,520
show of hand in the room

1304
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,200
okay so maybe half of the room okay

1305
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,880
that's nice

1306
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,960
it hasn't been advertised a lot so if

1307
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,480
you want to know about it you have to

1308
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,720
look at the minutes of the iecr board

1309
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,839
meeting

1310
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:32,800
and

1311
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,880
so they voted the decision that the

1312
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,400
board agrees to the creation of a new

1313
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,200
journal with seven a very nice objective

1314
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,119
it should be open access it should have

1315
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,040
fast decisions

1316
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,920
it should be allowed to uh absorb the

1317
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,599
the growing of the community so to

1318
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,599
publish more papers it should respect

1319
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,839
all areas of the community it should

1320
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,160
reduce the overall reviewing load

1321
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,599
uh it should

1322
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,119
allow publishing for people who don't

1323
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,799
want to travel to conferences and it

1324
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,160
should not compete with the current

1325
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,119
system but complement it so of course

1326
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,760
are all very nice and very interesting

1327
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,480
goals so certainly it's a very good

1328
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,680
project right

1329
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,200
let's look a little bit

1330
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,720
at more details so actually those

1331
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,960
details are very hard to find you could

1332
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,520
hear them if you attended the eurocrypt

1333
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,119
membership meeting or the azure credit

1334
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,119
membership meeting but there's nothing

1335
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,720
uh the meeting is not on youtube and the

1336
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,480
slides are not online so i have some

1337
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,079
screenshot of the slides i will try to

1338
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,839
explain to you how i understand the

1339
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,839
proposal i hope i'm not destroying

1340
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:33,040
distorting it too much

1341
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,880
so uh they first talked about the

1342
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,960
motivation and they uh

1343
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,680
perceived two problems the first one is

1344
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,920
a large reviewing load

1345
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,599
because of the conference system because

1346
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,119
uh if you have a good paper you're going

1347
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,520
to submit it to eurocrypt maybe gets

1348
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,440
rejected then you submit to crypto it's

1349
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,760
rejected you submit to asia crypts so

1350
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,839
every time we have to uh send the paper

1351
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,520
to a new set of reviewers so that's a

1352
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,359
large reviewing load and of course

1353
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:58,960
you're also wasting time as an author

1354
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,160
because you have to submit your paper

1355
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,160
again and again and this is in part due

1356
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,000
to the limited number of thoughts that

1357
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,760
we have in the conference crypto can

1358
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,640
only have maybe 60 or 80 talks but if

1359
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,160
there are more than this number of good

1360
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,160
papers submitted of course some good

1361
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,920
papers will be rejected and maybe they

1362
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,799
will be submitted again all right i

1363
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,400
absolutely agree with this problem and i

1364
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,520
think it would be great to solve it

1365
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,960
then they have this list of goals that

1366
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,559
i've already explained to you and they

1367
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,720
say that the idea ideology of this

1368
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,119
journal is that if a paper contains an

1369
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,880
original contribution relevant to a

1370
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,119
field of cryptography then it should be

1371
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,200
accepted so if you have a result that is

1372
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,680
correct and new then it should get into

1373
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,160
this new job

1374
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,359
and

1375
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,119
as i said earlier they only want to

1376
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,559
complement the current system not

1377
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:45,839
replace it and they want to allow

1378
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,599
publications for people who don't want

1379
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:48,880
to travel

1380
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,960
and uh they try to explain how it will

1381
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,640
interact with the journal of crypto and

1382
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,960
the transactions but it's not very clear

1383
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,559
what will actually happen

1384
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,480
so if you look at this proposal it looks

1385
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,240
a lot like task

1386
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,200
uh i mean we did this uh with fse we

1387
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,359
moved to this task model and i think

1388
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,040
we're very happy about it

1389
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,559
we don't have a fixed number of slots

1390
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:09,599
anymore

1391
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,680
the the general chair just has the task

1392
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,839
of making the conference work i mean the

1393
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:15,760
the editorial board accepts all papers

1394
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,520
that they think are good enough and then

1395
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,839
the general share must somehow solve the

1396
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,839
problem of the number of slots and so

1397
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,079
far this has been working nicely but we

1398
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,119
also have revisions so if a paper is

1399
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,880
good but not quite good enough or there

1400
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,119
are a few things to fix we can just ask

1401
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,960
exactly what we want to see fixed and

1402
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,240
then we just check that this has been

1403
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,400
fixed so it's much better than rejecting

1404
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,119
and submitting to a different conference

1405
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,440
however this new proposal is very

1406
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,119
different because it's not replacing

1407
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,520
something task has been replacing fse

1408
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,200
but this will not replace anything it's

1409
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,359
only complementing it and it's also

1410
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:53,040
aiming for uh to be not so selective so

1411
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,720
because of this i don't think i'm going

1412
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,319
to actually solve the problems because

1413
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,160
if i have a good paper

1414
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,160
a paper i think is good i will still

1415
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,720
submit to eurocrypt asia crypto and then

1416
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,000
be rejected and then maybe submit to a

1417
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,400
task or maybe a tcc or i don't know and

1418
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,400
then at the end maybe probably i will go

1419
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,960
to this journal so we're not solving the

1420
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,280
problem of uh reviewing load but we're

1421
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,040
not solving the problem of not enough

1422
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,720
thoughts because people would still want

1423
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,720
to go to the actual conferences with a

1424
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,799
limited number of slots so i think this

1425
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,720
is uh really unfortunate that there's a

1426
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,640
clear problem we want to solve

1427
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,119
and well in the fse community we have

1428
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,040
managed to solve it using a journal but

1429
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,799
this particular journal i don't see how

1430
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,079
it is solving

1431
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,359
the problem

1432
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:37,760
however there is a good side to it

1433
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,359
is that we can now explore new

1434
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,000
directions in cryptography that's how i

1435
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,839
go to the title of my talk

1436
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,440
because uh there are many areas in

1437
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,839
cryptography that nobody has explored

1438
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,520
but now you can try to explore them and

1439
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,200
as long as you can write a paper at the

1440
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,599
end that is both new and correct you

1441
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,119
should get a publication so that's good

1442
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,400
for you that's good for the community

1443
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,079
that's good for everybody and there are

1444
00:58:58,079 --> 00:58:59,680
lots of new directions you could look at

1445
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,480
so you could talk about new designs for

1446
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,319
instance you could try to look at 11

1447
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,760
rounds a yes

1448
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,240
that's new right nobody has done it yet

1449
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,079
i'm sure you could do it correctly and

1450
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,520
it's interesting because it's more

1451
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,119
secure than the current world standard

1452
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:16,640
and it's only 10 percent slower

1453
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,960
you could also do a new attacks maybe

1454
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,720
you can try to do cryptanalysis of a

1455
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,880
chaos-based image encryption scheme i

1456
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,200
mean those schemes are published uh i'm

1457
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,960
sure nobody has tried to break them it's

1458
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,799
probably not very hard so you could have

1459
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,799
a paper that is both new and correct but

1460
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,720
not interesting but apparently this

1461
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,160
doesn't matter

1462
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,240
you could also do new uh implementations

1463
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,839
maybe you can implement ketchup on the

1464
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,760
turing machine i'm sure nobody has done

1465
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,839
it yet

1466
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:43,520
maybe you can design a new scheme based

1467
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,520
on rubik's cube and you can apply it to

1468
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,359
a encrypted hungarian phrasebook

1469
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,960
you could do a quantum collision attack

1470
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,960
against md4 i'm sure this hasn't been

1471
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,400
done yet so it can be new and correct

1472
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,480
maybe you can look at sha-256 it's a

1473
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,160
very important function lots of people

1474
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,240
are computing sha-256 so you could do a

1475
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,319
new implementation maybe a constant time

1476
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:05,920
implementation for bitcoin mining i'm

1477
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,880
sure that's not been done yet

1478
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,359
uh you could uh build a new prng that

1479
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,200
passes this randomness test that's not

1480
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,880
very hard you could have something that

1481
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,160
is actually correct in the sense that

1482
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,559
this passes the test

1483
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,160
and maybe you could do neural network

1484
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,960
crit analysis of the caesar cipher

1485
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,200
thank you

1486
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,200
thanks so uh i would like to tell you uh

1487
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,720
uh some a few words uh on behalf of the

1488
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,359
fsc steering committee so but because we

1489
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:49,680
are in greece of course i would like to

1490
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,799
first focus on some very important

1491
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,839
characters from the greek

1492
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:57,520
mythology i guess all of you

1493
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,319
know this this guy says first of course

1494
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:05,440
jesus he he was punished by this and uh

1495
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,119
he is forced

1496
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:10,720
as you know to roll a big boulder up to

1497
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,839
a hill and each time his boulder reaches

1498
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,760
the top of the hill then he travels down

1499
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,920
and says if it has to do this again and

1500
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,799
again

1501
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:20,640
for eternity

1502
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,280
also some very interesting characters

1503
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,000
from the greek mythology arvis

1504
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,240
the nades

1505
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,559
they have been condemned

1506
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:34,079
to spend eternity

1507
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,079
pouring water into a jar which has a big

1508
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,000
hole i think they are very interesting

1509
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,720
characters for us because they might be

1510
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,480
seen as the founders of the chess

1511
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,240
community because they showed for the

1512
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,960
first time that leakage is definitely

1513
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,520
something very important which should be

1514
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,599
taken into account

1515
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,359
and so we have these nice characters

1516
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:58,400
from the mythology this the natives and

1517
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,079
scissors also but now we also have

1518
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:03,920
christine as punishment

1519
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,920
it seems that she has been condemned to

1520
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,200
organize fsc for eternity

1521
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,559
uh she did it already three times in

1522
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:17,359
march 2020 in november 2020 right now

1523
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,559
and because i guess that all of us we

1524
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:23,119
appreciate a very

1525
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,240
nice organization everything is perfect

1526
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,520
here as a venue the food and so on i

1527
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,480
think maybe we we could think about

1528
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,720
having fsc here in greece um maybe in

1529
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,359
the coming years on over or several

1530
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,359
other times so

1531
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:44,079

1544
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,640

01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,720
what you don't know is that kevin is in

1546
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,440

1551
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:01,680
okay

1552
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,319
and uh also i would like to say a few

1553
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:09,839
words uh on fsc 2023 as uh you heard fsc

1554
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:13,039
2023 will be in beijing in china and i i

1555
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:15,119
would like to thank original chair being

1556
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,359
done and making one

1557
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:20,319
because uh i told you about christina's

1558
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:23,200
punishment but they uh

1559
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,799
will organize fsc in china

1560
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:29,920
at least twice because fse 2023 was

1561
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,280
initially scheduled for 2022 so which

1562
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,839
means that it will be a second time next

1563
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,400
year but i've i hope that we'll organize

1564
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,960
it exactly twice and

1565
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,880
not more than twice and so that we will

1566
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,440
enjoy all the conference in china next

1567
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,280
year

1568
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,200
and so what's about 2024 well 2024 there

1569
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,119
is no plan so which means that we are

1570
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:55,520
looking for volunteers so if you would

1571
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,480
like to organize fsc 2024 please contact

1572
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,119
me or or any member from the steering

1573
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:02,240
committee

1574
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,440
well uh

1575
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,520
after this uh experience of a very long

1576
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,079
punishments maybe we will prefer someone

1577
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,319
who lives in the country where you have

1578
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,880
more tradition of very quick tournaments

1579
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,799
but it's better for organizing a

1580
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,759
conference i think

1581
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:23,599
okay so now we i want also to thank our

1582
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:27,200
program chair gaito itai and and barton

1583
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,000
and

1584
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,039
uh when preparing this uh talk uh i was

1585
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:33,520
wondering whether we can compare them to

1586
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,480
minos sarped

1587
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,240
i don't know what you think about it if

1588
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,400
you think that they they look like those

1589
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,680
three guys

1590
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,520
well

1591
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,960
who knows who are these three guys

1592
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,039
except christina but christina doesn't

1593
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:49,760
count okay these are the three judges in

1594
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,720
the underworld and they're very famous

1595
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,480
because they show inflexible judgments

1596
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,280
or maybe another comparison could be

1597
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,799
with brontes therapists and artists

1598
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:05,200
and here i don't know if you can see

1599
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,599
from from the picture what we are doing

1600
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,559
but well these are the three cyclops and

1601
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,640
we can see that we are working very hard

1602
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,960
on the paper assignments we've had crap

1603
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,400
here

1604
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,720
but i think at the end that the best

1605
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,440
comparison is with clothes

1606
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,640
lashes and atropos and then you maybe

1607
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,599
you know

1608
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,440
these three women

1609
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,000
it's very clear that these are the three

1610
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,039
fates and their role is to ensure that

1611
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,280
every submission leaves out its destiny

1612
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,000
so as you can see the first one is the

1613
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,119
one for acceptance the one in the middle

1614
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:44,160
recommends major revision and and the

1615
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,000
last one of course is in charge of

1616
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,559
rejection

1617
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,880
okay so uh

1618
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,760
please uh let's thanks all free program

1619
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,400
chairs uh because they prefer this very

1620
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,720
nice program

1621
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,400
so you don't have the virtual tag this

1622
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,559
year

1623
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,559
bye

1624
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:21,310
[Music]

1625
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:24,489
[Applause]

1626
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,520
okay now comes the tragic part of the

1627
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,680
talk

1628
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,599
so you know in a greek tragedy usually

1629
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:35,920
it starts with people saying that we are

1630
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,160
not happy with something that people

1631
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,119
complaining and at the end someone dies

1632
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,920
so i hope we will just stay at the

1633
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,039
beginning

1634
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:49,599
uh so uh you got the funny part of this

1635
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:52,480
uh just before uh with gaito

1636
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,680
gaito explained this uh proposal uh for

1637
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,880
creating a a new journal a proposal made

1638
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,880
by the board of iscr

1639
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,880
and so we discussed within the fsc

1640
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,440
steering committee and uh we arrived to

1641
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,000
the conclusion that we think that it's

1642
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,440
not a good idea for our community

1643
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,480
and so

1644
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,480
because uh within the steering committee

1645
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,600
we all agree on that uh what we propose

1646
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,960
is to send a statement to the board to

1647
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,520
the ioc or board to explain why we think

1648
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,479
that it's not a good idea and to to make

1649
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,799
some proposal to the board

1650
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,960
and so of course uh

1651
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,279
it's only at the moment the opinion of

1652
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,359
the steering committee and so i would

1653
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:38,560
like to show you as a proposal we made

1654
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,158
for this statement

1655
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,080
and then i will ask you whether you

1656
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,880
agree or not that we send this statement

1657
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,279
and then we could say if you agree that

1658
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:49,920
this statement comes from the attendance

1659
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:50,839
of the

1660
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:54,238
countries so uh it's it's probably

1661
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,000
written it's probably very small i'm

1662
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,479
sorry i cannot do it better but well let

1663
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:01,359
me first explain uh uh

1664
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,319
statement and then uh we can have a

1665
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,120
discussion and and and you you can give

1666
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,080
your opinion on that so uh as gaeton

1667
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,040
explained at last eurocrypt uh uh a

1668
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,080
proposal for a new journal uh was

1669
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,880
presented and basically it has been

1670
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,600
explained that it has two different aims

1671
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,319
the first one is to publish papers that

1672
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,640
are correct but not interesting enough

1673
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,439
to be accepted to the current venues

1674
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:32,238
and the second aim was also uh to accept

1675
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:34,238
papers in the scope of real-world

1676
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:36,799
encryption we're about crypto sorry

1677
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:38,799
because at the moment it seems that for

1678
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,399
people publishing in this area it's

1679
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,479
quite difficult to to to have

1680
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,319
publication

1681
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,080
uh and so what happens is that for fsc

1682
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,719
but also for the chess community uh it

1683
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,679
happens that we are in a

1684
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:56,480
different situation from uh the pkc or

1685
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,960
tcc community because what we did is

1686
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,040
that now six years ago

1687
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,440
we decided to launch a journal and to

1688
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,159
move to this hybrid conference journal

1689
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,640
model so we now have the transaction on

1690
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,800
symmetric cryptology and

1691
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,679
we

1692
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:14,400
are uh as a steering committee at least

1693
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,239
we are quite happy with that because we

1694
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,000
think that the quality of the paper is

1695
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,560
substantially improved when moving from

1696
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,400
the conference model to the journal

1697
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,760
model

1698
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,640
and also more papers are accepted than

1699
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,040
before and uh

1700
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,120
we changed the format of the conference

1701
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,199
because at the beginning fsc was only

1702
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:34,880
two days and a half or three days and

1703
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,800
you can see that now we have the whole

1704
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,880
week or almost a whole week

1705
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,040
and so because we are very happy with

1706
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,600
our situation and this model

1707
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,679
we don't see for our communities a need

1708
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,320
for a new journal because we already

1709
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,280
have one

1710
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,880
and uh

1711
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,280
i think that if we believe but we we can

1712
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,280
discuss this at some point if we believe

1713
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,920
that more papers uh needs to be

1714
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,000
published then we can publish them in

1715
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,080
tasks because if this is a journal so we

1716
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,320
have no constraints about the number of

1717
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,719
papers we can publish and we can adapt

1718
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:09,920
the format of the conference accordingly

1719
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,480
and so we think it's important because

1720
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,040
uh we would like to avoid an increase in

1721
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,000
the review load for for the community

1722
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,640
and if we have two different journals uh

1723
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,840
with papers on symmetry crypto of course

1724
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,480
uh this will increase that uh so the

1725
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,080
review

1726
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,600
and uh maybe more importantly uh we

1727
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,000
think that having this second journal

1728
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
would be something very confusing

1729
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,880
because uh we will have uh two

1730
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,159
uh journal two journal published by uh

1731
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:45,280
well two is your journals uh these two

1732
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,040
journals will be of very different

1733
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,239
quality but they will cover the area of

1734
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,040
symmetric crypto and they'll look very

1735
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,880
they will they would look very similar

1736
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,080
because they

1737
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,480
they will have a title like bios or

1738
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,679
something

1739
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:02,000
and and so it would be very confusing

1740
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,239
especially for for people outside from

1741
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:05,760
the community so

1742
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,040
uh

1743
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,960
it seems that uh for us for instance it

1744
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,960
would be very difficult to explain this

1745
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,840
to someone outside in a hiring jury or

1746
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,040
something but

1747
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,120
how these two journals are related or

1748
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,239
not and also this will be in addition uh

1749
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,400
to the journal of cryptology that we

1750
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,080
already have

1751
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,719
and so because of that uh we would like

1752
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:28,080
to ask the

1753
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,440
vr the ios or board of directors to uh

1754
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,800
limit uh the innovation uh in

1755
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,280
publications in this new journal to rs

1756
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,440
which are not covered by fsc and

1757
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,760
probably by chess which follows the same

1758
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,320
model as the one we have here

1759
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,640
and more generally uh we believe that uh

1760
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,280
things are really uh changing right now

1761
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,920
concerning uh

1762
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,360
the behavior

1763
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:00,159
of the people of researchers uh

1764
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:03,040
for uh conferences and journals and and

1765
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,960
everything related to our publication

1766
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,679
system what i mean is that uh with the

1767
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,880
pandemia we had to uh experience this

1768
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,120
virtual conferences hybrid conferences

1769
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,600
as we have today and also there is some

1770
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,000
pressure uh people want

1771
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,920
or some people uh

1772
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,199
don't want to to travel uh anymore or at

1773
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,920
least not 10 times a year or something

1774
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,560
like this so i think we need a

1775
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,000
discussion and an in-depth discussion uh

1776
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,719
about this so about everything uh how

1777
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,120
many conferences we want uh

1778
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,199
what is the role of all three flagships

1779
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,120
conferences the role of the area

1780
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,239
conferences uh and journals in between

1781
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,239
so this is something much more general

1782
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,840
than having

1783
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,320
adding just a new journal and that's it

1784
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,600
so probably we need to think about that

1785
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,199
with the whole crypto community and uh

1786
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,880
well this was a

1787
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,040
or message from the steering committee

1788
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,199
we would like to have a more general

1789
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:06,480
discussion with all isr members about it

1790
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,760
so this is basically the statement so uh

1791
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,360
i don't know if you

1792
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,640
have any feedback or any comment or if

1793
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,360
someone thinks that it's a very bad idea

1794
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,320
to to send this statement so maybe it's

1795
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,440
better if you come here yeah so

1796
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,400
yeah

1797
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:28,679
if i need to repeat everything

1798
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,440
just about the statement

1799
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,719
um

1800
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:38,400
all what you said

1801
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,199
about the review load of

1802
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,120
and also they don't say the but revealed

1803
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,280
of your clip crypto and other clips

1804
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,480
doesn't appear in the statement here

1805
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,679
so i

1806
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:52,640
or maybe i misunderstood something

1807
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,520
um i mean this would avoid an increase

1808
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,199
in regular load

1809
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:00,480
but it seems not related to abundant

1810
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,239
overall conferences

1811
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:03,600
i mean it's just

1812
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,080
id it's just a statement for adding a

1813
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:06,960
new

1814
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,280
journal but it doesn't

1815
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,800
express that you

1816
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,679
want or we would like to say something

1817
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:14,640
about

1818
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,199
changing the overall big conferences

1819
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:19,199
which is one i mean

1820
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:21,759
if i add

1821
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,600
correctly yeah this is the the last

1822
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,719
sentence say that we would like a a more

1823
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:31,280
general discussion

1824
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:35,199
this is what we mean yeah so uh

1825
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:36,880
yeah that's just

1826
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,760
uh it seems a bit light

1827
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,000
i mean it's lighter

1828
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,280
that

1829
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,400
and what you said

1830
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,400
[Music]

1831
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,960
what what i said is that i think that we

1832
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,800
we need to discuss about it because i

1833
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,040
i'm not sure that everybody agrees and

1834
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,880
and it will probably take some time to

1835
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,120
reach a consensus on that point i don't

1836
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,880
know but well

1837
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,800
this is what i hear as feedback for

1838
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,480
instance at last your equipment says

1839
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,159
some people say i don't want to travel

1840
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:08,480
anymore and sometimes other people say

1841
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,960
no it's much better to have an in person

1842
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,640
conference so i i think we need a

1843
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,880
discussion on that so this is why this

1844
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,400
last sentence is

1845
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,000
we need a discussion i don't know what

1846
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,920
will the output of this discussion will

1847
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:20,960
be but

1848
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,239
at least we need a discussion

1849
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,320
if i understand correctly the point of

1850
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,840
this statement is not to say we should

1851
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,080
do this is to say

1852
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,159
we really shouldn't do that

1853
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:34,159
like there is this uh well specified

1854
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,320
thing and we disagree with it what

1855
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,400
replace it with

1856
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,840
that's another question to be discussed

1857
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:40,960
another time

1858
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,800
do i understand correctly

1859
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:47,320
i understand correct okay thanks

1860
01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:59,199
is there someone online who would like

1861
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:01,600
to say something about this or who who

1862
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,400
would disagree

1863
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:08,280
that we send this statement

1864
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:23,120
where can you see that

1865
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:26,719
in the zollip chat or

1866
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,040
okay yeah

1867
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,719
oh wait yeah i i see

1868
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,040
okay so

1869
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,199
is there any opinion or does it mean

1870
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:45,199
that everyone's

1871
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:48,080
everyone agrees well

1872
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,239
maybe we can just have a vote i won't

1873
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:53,280
count exactly but just to to to see how

1874
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:57,600
it looks like uh let's start with uh

1875
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,360
kevin

1876
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,120
i just wanted to say i'm actually on the

1877
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,600
committee for the new journal

1878
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,920
and uh one of the things i had proposed

1879
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,840
in the committee is that we expand the

1880
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,719
scope of the committee to look at a more

1881
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,800
in-depth discussion about the publishing

1882
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,080
of icr because it feels very fragmented

1883
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,280
right now

1884
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,480
we have

1885
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,320
task and teaches we have the journal

1886
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,120
cryptology we have all the conferences

1887
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:23,920
and

1888
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,440
you know the springer proceedings we

1889
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,719
have eprint

1890
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:28,480
and it seems like a mishmash of

1891
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,440
different

1892
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,920
systems and it would be nice to reduce

1893
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,520
the number of systems instead of

1894
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,159
increase the number of systems

1895
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,000
but that was kind of rejected by the

1896
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,040
committee

1897
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,719
as to grand the scope

1898
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,880
okay so well we will try if we all agree

1899
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,760
with the statement we will try again

1900
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,560
to have a broader scope for this

1901
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,400
discussion

1902
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,880
um let me look at the chat so so

1903
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,679
just to to

1904
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,199
to check

1905
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:04,239
um

1906
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,960
is there someone in the room who does

1907
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,840
not agree that we sent a statement to do

1908
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,360
the board

1909
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,480
please raise your hand

1910
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,719
so who agrees that will send this

1911
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:19,199
statement

1912
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:20,840
okay

1913
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,679
thanks so you cannot see but nobody was

1914
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:26,400
against it in the room and i i didn't

1915
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,840
come but i i see uh uh

1916
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,040
most hence

1917
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,239
for uh people who agrees uh let me do

1918
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,960
that um

1919
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,080
with online people um

1920
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,800
[Music]

1921
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,000
can i

1922
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,199
uh is i think i can see if you raise

1923
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,360
your hand i think there's a features and

1924
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:52,640
zoom where you can raise your hand

1925
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,640
um

1926
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,080
okay

1927
01:20:21,410 --> 01:20:24,470
[Music]

1928
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,040
well but yeah i don't know if everyone

1929
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:29,760
can

1930
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,199
can

1931
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,120
can use the pool i remember that when

1932
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:37,520
you will we are using it works okay

1933
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,199
i think it doesn't work if you're on a

1934
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:41,040
web browser

1935
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,840
yes yes

1936
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,360
well it at least it gives some uh

1937
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,360
okay good

1938
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,880
otherwise they should just write this

1939
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,840
agreement

1940
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:06,159
so let's just wait for a few minutes

1941
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,320
okay at the moment i see three people

1942
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:14,159
who disagree with the proposal and uh 12

1943
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:15,440
who agree

1944
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,639
and two without any opinion on that

1945
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:20,800
okay and it seems that just it stopped

1946
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,320
so well

1947
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,679
i think we can

1948
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:25,199
conclude from

1949
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:27,520
this discussion this quick discussion

1950
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,719
but uh

1951
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:29,760
uh

1952
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,960
the majority agrees that uh the steering

1953
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,679
committee sends this statement

1954
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,280
to the board

1955
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,760
and then we will see what will happen

1956
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,360
and uh well and i hope we will have a a

1957
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,400
discussion at uh eurocrypt

1958
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,280
which will be the next conference where

1959
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,400
we will

1960
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,679
be here

1961
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:55,120
on on this new journal and i hopefully a

1962
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,480
more general discussion on the

1963
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,880
publication system so thanks to all of

1964
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,520
you thank you

1965
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:22,040
is

1966
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,760
okay we somehow randomly looked at the

1967
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,679
the decisions but uh

1968
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:34,239
those are educated uh guesses

1969
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:36,719
now we kind of uh we think one of them

1970
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,960
stood out as being funniest

1971
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,920
so i think that's the one of jan rodella

1972
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,639
the yota alpha laborers of the

1973
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,290
cryptanalysis

1974
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:49,640
[Applause]

1975
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,800
we didn't do anything we just had to

1976
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,800
decide

1977
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,000
um yeah i can continue yeah

1978
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,159
okay so yeah actually young also tried

1979
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,560
to do the most mythological references

1980
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,400
but you don't can only get one price i'm

1981
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,520
sorry you can sit down um the second

1982
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,000
most methodological references goes to

1983
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,280
an canto

1984
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:28,840
so for uh

1985
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,920
okay for the most tragic performances

1986
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,000
i'm sorry i'm not giving the right names

1987
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,199
of the the

1988
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:51,040
prices okay yes

1989
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:54,000
so the most tragic performance um yeah

1990
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,080
it's for two reasons one first of them

1991
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,760
because it failed in the beginning and

1992
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,679
the second one because they actually did

1993
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:01,440
the effort to make a video

1994
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,360
so it's for a

1995
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,159
differential attacks on speedy um

1996
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:07,920
yeah actually it's a bit biased because

1997
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,480
christina is also on there

1998
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:14,199
but please come forward

1999
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:21,840
so our youtube videos the modern

2000
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,639
equivalent of great strategies then yes

2001
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:27,120
i think so

2002
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,580
and that's

2003
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:33,640
[Music]

2004
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,639
so that would be the end of the rom

2005
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:39,199
session also for our friends online

2006
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:42,199
um
