00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,560
hello and welcome to listen to my talk

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,279
my name is kaiser newberry and the title

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,840
of my talk is statistical model of

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,719
correlation difference and related key

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,119
linear cryptanalysis

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,000
first i will give an introduction and

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,080
then present our contribution and

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,680
finally discuss

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,400
some aspects of the solution

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,399
first introduction and motivation

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,680
the scope

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,840
of the talk is related key linear

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,360
cryptanalysis

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,160
there is not much literature and much

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,079
work in this area

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,280
so i hope that presenting a correct

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,760
model correct statistical model of

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,120
linear uh

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,680
related key linear cryptanalysis will

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,280
encourage more work in this area

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,520
so the idea is that given a linear

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,920
approximation

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,799
its correlations are computed for two

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,439
different related keys

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,240
and now the problem has been that there

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,960
are statistical dependencies

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,880
over the data

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,640
and also over the related key pairs

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,200
when we compute these two

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,360
correlations

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,000
of course using two independent data

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
samples will would remove the first

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,280
dependency but the second one still

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,799
remains

35
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,040
and this

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,600
program has not been properly addressed

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,200
in the existing

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,400
literature

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,960
and my goal is to fill

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,360
this gap

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,439
so let us have a look at the difference

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,439
of related key correlations and

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,000
particularly in the case of iterated

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,840
block

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,759
cipher so the correlation

46
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,439
is can be

47
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,439
for an iterated block cipher the

48
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,600
correlation can be

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,200
given as a sum taken over all traits

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,040
ending with a

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,280
input mask a and output mask b

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,480
of the trail correlations

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,480
with signs depending on the key

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
and now

55
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,120
when we take the difference we get this

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,800
factor

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,879
which depends only on the key difference

58
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,319
delta

59
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,680
and we can see that terms with

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,840
tau

61
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,840
delta the inner product between tau and

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,599
delta equals zero cancel out

63
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,360
meaning that

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,920
there are less

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,120
terms

66
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,480
in this sum

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,519
and less possible values also for this

68
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,319
sum

69
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,680
and these facts may facilitate mature's

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,560
algorithm one type key recovery as

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,560
discussed in

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,040
the paper by rook and nyberg in 2013

73
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,959
a second

74
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,680
aspect or possibility to exploit this

75
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,599
fact is

76
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,800
particularly

77
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,080
in a case

78
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,319
where all the remaining terms are equal

79
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,319
to zero that is all the trail

80
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,080
correlations with tau

81
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,799
uh with a tau uh inner product between

82
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,720
tau and delta equals one

83
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,519
uh disappear

84
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,159
and these are the two main applications

85
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,400
previously

86
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,319
handled in the literature

87
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,080
let's have a closer look at the

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,360
algorithm one type key recovery

89
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,000
the key there the keys are divided into

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,760
key classes

91
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
and now we

92
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,040
know this key class by the value c that

93
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,760
the difference of correlations

94
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,959
take

95
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,879
and if the value c are sufficiently

96
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,000
apart then using a sufficiently large

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,480
sample the key class can be identified

98
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,959
so given a sample of size n the attacker

99
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,120
computes a sampled correlation

100
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,480
difference

101
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,360
and

102
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,680
under the assumption that these two

103
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,759
correlations are statistically

104
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,600
independent

105
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
we get that

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,000
within the key class

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,560
key k c

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,040
the sample correlation

109
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,440
the sample correlation is normally

110
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,680
distributed with mean c

111
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,360
and variance 2 over n

112
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,479
then given this distribution one can use

113
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,600
different

114
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,280
kind of um decision algorithms to decide

115
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
which key class

116
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,000
is the

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,800
most likely one there's one decision

118
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,160
algorithm present in the paper by rick

119
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,440
and nyberg

120
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,759
and another one

121
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,800
presented in the single key context by

122
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
ashuren reiman

123
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,840
but this can also easily apply to the

124
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,960
related key case

125
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,080
next the second

126
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,360
type of

127
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,720
application is a distinguisher

128
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,759
and

129
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,800
there

130
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,080
which can be used for key recovery also

131
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,360
in the algorithm two type of

132
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,520
of key recovery

133
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,199
and this is uh based on the so-called

134
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,240
key difference invariant bias

135
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,360
property

136
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,800
uh as introduced by boknardov and others

137
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
in 2013.

138
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,520
they know so that

139
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
have had observed

140
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,400
that

141
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
two cyphers

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,680
l block and twine have such a property

143
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,919
that under related keys

144
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,479
the difference of correlation

145
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,680
of some linear approximations are equal

146
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,880
to zero

147
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,400
actually they were

148
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,960
able to identify a number of those a

149
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,880
small number of such

150
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,600
linear approximations and then they used

151
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,919
a multiple

152
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,800
multiple linear group analysis type

153
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,640
of approach to

154
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,400
[Music]

155
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,960
to build a distinguisher for this case

156
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,560
but for the distinguisher we need to

157
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,720
know what is the random behavior and

158
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,039
we need to know what is the behavior

159
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,240
expected from the cipher so from the

160
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,199
cipher we expect this behavior and for

161
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,240
the random pair of functions of course

162
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,600
the mean is expected to be 0 as well but

163
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,400
the variance is larger is 2 to the 1

164
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,080
minus

165
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,318
in

166
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,000
and

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,400
assuming that these correlations are

168
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,039
statistically independent

169
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,319
then

170
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,520
if

171
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,639
we do

172
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,520
key recovery

173
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,240
testing by trying different key

174
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,840
candidates

175
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,280
or par

176
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,599
candidates for part of the key and if

177
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,720
the key is

178
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,240
fully correct

179
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,560
then we expect to see this

180
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,720
property that the cipher has the key

181
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,919
difference in variant bias property

182
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,039
if the key is not fully correct

183
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,840
we expect to see the random problem

184
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,880
and the decision algorithm based on

185
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,039
hypothesis testing is

186
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,840
presented in the

187
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
in the

188
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,960
paper in their paper

189
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,400
and how to do we sample

190
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,440
for

191
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,240
this

192
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
key difference invariant bias

193
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,759
distinguisher

194
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,639
the same way as before we compute the

195
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,720
sample of

196
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,879
given a sample of plain text of size n

197
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,919
we

198
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,280
get the corresponding cipher texts and

199
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,400
then come with under two different keys

200
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,879
then compute the correlations

201
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,759
and

202
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,479
the difference of the correlation

203
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,479
and again we

204
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,440
the the model the bogdanov and others

205
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,680
we're using um

206
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,160
were assumed that the correlations are

207
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,319
statistically independent

208
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,320
also over the random samples

209
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,760
and then in that case the

210
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,320
the over the random samples the

211
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,799
correlation is normally distributed with

212
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,480
the expected value c and variance 2 over

213
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,640
n

214
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,920
then putting these things together from

215
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,839
the previous page and this

216
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,240
the behavior of the c

217
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,320
distribution of the c and this

218
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,360
over the

219
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,120
of the keys

220
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,600
and the distribution of the

221
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,560
c hat over random samples we get that

222
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,360
for the right key where we expect to see

223
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,640
the

224
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,399
behavior of the cipher the kdib property

225
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,320
we get that c hat is normally

226
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,680
distributed

227
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
with mean 0 and

228
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,399
variance 2 over n

229
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,560
while for the wrong key the

230
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,760
corresponding distribution is has is

231
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,839
also normal but now

232
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,959
means 0

233
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,320
and various slightly larger two over n

234
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,920
plus to the one minus n

235
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,200
so now our contribution to these models

236
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,080
um

237
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,440
first let us recall the problems we test

238
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,959
so

239
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,000
there

240
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,360
the problem

241
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,519
is that even for a random pair of

242
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,360
pair of random functions f and f prime

243
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,920
these correlations

244
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,240
may not be or are not

245
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,200
actually are not never fully independent

246
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,959
and

247
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,040
we

248
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,279
remove this assumption

249
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,800
and prove

250
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,000
the same distribution as we saw before

251
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,519
without any independence assumption

252
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,720
the second problem is that over the

253
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,600
random of the data samples

254
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,360
these correlations

255
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,480
for a fixed key

256
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,560
are not statistically independent

257
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,040
and our contribution is that we give an

258
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,760
exact expression of the variance of the

259
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,240
sample correlation difference

260
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,839
without independence assumption

261
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,320
instead

262
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,079
it's an exact expression containing

263
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,120
another parameter which we will discuss

264
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,880
later

265
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,959
and which will allow a much more natural

266
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,959
assumption

267
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,560
so in this way we can confirm but also

268
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,800
generalize the distribution used by rick

269
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,640
and nyberg

270
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,760
and we can also confirm and analyze the

271
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,560
previous understanding of the

272
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,320
correlation difference

273
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,160
in the case of kdib

274
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,079
property

275
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,200
may be

276
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
generalized to different type of

277
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,760
related key correlation properties

278
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,040
the main theorem

279
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,640
concerns

280
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,959
just a pair of boolean functions of any

281
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,839
bit vectors

282
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,800
linear approximations are

283
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,479
are such boolean functions

284
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,480
and

285
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,079
define the correlation as usual

286
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,480
and the difference of the correlations

287
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,360
and the sampled correlations as

288
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,800
given the same way we already discussed

289
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,959
these quantities

290
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,480
and let n denote the size of a sample

291
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,800
and now

292
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,040
a new parameter

293
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,440
is

294
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,360
we denote it by q

295
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,399
and it is the probability that these two

296
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,000
boolean functions

297
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,639
are equal

298
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,079
in other

299
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,720
words we can write it as

300
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,760
one half times one plus the correlation

301
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,279
between f and f prime

302
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,760
then we get that the mean of the sampled

303
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,120
correlation

304
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,360
is equal to c

305
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,240
and the variance is equal to 4b divided

306
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,000
by n times

307
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
q minus c squared

308
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
divided by 4 where b

309
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,800
is the so-called

310
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,639
finite population correction coefficient

311
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,680
which has

312
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,320
the expression two n minus n divided by

313
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,240
two n minus

314
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,440
one

315
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,880
if the sample is drawn without

316
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,240
replacement

317
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,880
and one if the samples is drawn with

318
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,680
replacement

319
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,839
if the sample is drawn without

320
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,040
replacement we use hypergeometric

321
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,480
distribution

322
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,360
here

323
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
and if the sample is drawn with

324
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,880
replacement we use the binomial

325
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,120
distribution

326
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,360
and the difference

327
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
and the the

328
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,639
variances in these two cases for these

329
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,839
two type of distributions

330
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,560
this uh

331
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,680
are different

332
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,199
by

333
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,519
this quantity 2n minus n times 2n minus

334
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,399
1.

335
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,120
in fact when we multiply

336
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,440
the variance of the binomial in the

337
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,120
binomial case

338
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,040
with this quantity

339
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,120
we get the variance in the

340
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,720
hypergeometric case

341
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,560
so this binomial and hybrid geometric

342
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,920
distributions

343
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,399
can be approximated using the normal

344
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,440
distribution with the given mean and the

345
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,800
sample

346
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,120
given the mean and and the variance

347
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,079
over the random sound

348
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,519
as you morrow over that the means

349
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,279
the c

350
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,480
has

351
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,760
is normally distributed with mean mu and

352
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,279
sigma square

353
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,720
variance

354
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,040
center distribution the integrated

355
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,399
distribution

356
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
over the data samples and over the

357
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,360
related function pairs

358
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,560
of the c hat is approximately normal

359
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,519
with mean equal to mu and variance equal

360
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,320
to

361
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,480
this quantity

362
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,240
i have put here where q is the mean of

363
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,880
q recall the probability q that the

364
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,160
functions are

365
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,120
equal

366
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,680
over the related function pairs

367
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,079
so the mean is taken over the related

368
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,959
function pairs

369
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,120
this

370
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,959
this formula doesn't appear in the paper

371
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,800
i just

372
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,680
i put it here

373
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,880
i put it here

374
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,240
in the paper

375
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,399
we only considered

376
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,199
the special two special cases in the

377
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,639
kdib case

378
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,360
the two special cases are the case of

379
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,560
cipher and the case of the random

380
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,959
in the case of the cipher mu is equal to

381
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,600
zero and also the variance is equal to

382
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,519
zero because the difference of the

383
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,320
correlations is a constant

384
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,519
and then

385
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,480
the

386
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,839
c hat

387
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,279
is normally distributed by zero

388
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,040
mean and variance for vq divided by n

389
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,399
where b is sp4 and q also as before

390
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,079
and for random

391
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,199
actually the q is equal to

392
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,519
one half

393
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,440
and um

394
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,880
and the

395
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,199
mean mu is equal to zero and sigma

396
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,480
squared is

397
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,440
uh two to the one minus n

398
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,720
and then the integrated distribution for

399
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,360
c hat over the samples and over the

400
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,560
random

401
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,240
random functions

402
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,120
is equal to

403
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,240
it's normally a normal distribution with

404
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,679
the mean equal to zero and variance

405
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,319
equal to two to the one minus n plus two

406
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,079
b divided by n

407
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,319
times one minus two to the minus n

408
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,079
and we can now

409
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,679
look at different cases with replacement

410
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,319
we put b equal to one

411
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,039
without replacement we would be equal to

412
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,840
the constant defined

413
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,559
before and then in the random case

414
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,240
from this formula

415
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,679
we get

416
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,280
this

417
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
with replay this

418
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,520
formula for replacement

419
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,840
and for

420
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,120
cipher 2 over n assuming that q is equal

421
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
to one half

422
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,600
and um

423
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,080
without replacement

424
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,320
we get 2 over n

425
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,600
for random

426
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,360
from this expression actually it

427
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,120
simplifies to 2 over n

428
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,720
and

429
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,400
for the cipher we get this quantity so

430
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,880
for the cipher the variance is always

431
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,400
slightly smaller

432
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,760
and this allows given sufficient

433
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,520
amount of

434
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,440
plain text

435
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,160
and the related cipher texts

436
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,000
we can

437
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,120
distinguish between the cipher and

438
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,720
the random

439
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,640
or wrong key and the right key

440
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,200
finally

441
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,600
discuss the discussion

442
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,120
first i want to discuss the role of q

443
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,200
so the q is the average correlation

444
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,559
between

445
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,000
the a bit of a cipher text computed

446
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,200
[Music]

447
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,640
with key

448
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,760
k

449
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,720
and

450
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,440
the real corresponding bit computed with

451
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,880
the different with the related key

452
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,720
it's the average correlation between

453
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,200
these two numbers

454
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,080
setting q equal to one-half means that

455
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,600
the relative

456
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,320
are uncorrelated

457
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,679
so simply setting q equals one-half

458
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,799
and

459
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,760
with this q equals to one-half we get

460
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,559
exactly the same distributions as used

461
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,520
before

462
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,720
in the previous literature on the

463
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,440
uh by bogdanov and others and by rick

464
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,039
and newberry

465
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,679
so the assumption about independence

466
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,640
statistical independence of related key

467
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,360
correlations of a linear approximation

468
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,000
can now be replaced by a very concrete

469
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,320
assumption about uncorrelated

470
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,039
ciphertexts under related keys

471
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,799
and moreover

472
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,600
this assumption is a very natural one

473
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,720
and supposed to be satisfied for

474
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,480
modern ciphers

475
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,320
which

476
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,559
are designed not to

477
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,960
not to have cipher text only

478
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,640
attacks

479
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,440
in particularly if q is different from

480
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,559
one half

481
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,159
it means

482
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,039
that

483
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,559
this bit computed from the

484
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,360
related ciphertext

485
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,799
is not expected to be balanced

486
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,919
meaning that it may allow a cipher text

487
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,960
only related key attack if the the

488
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,280
balancedness is

489
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,480
unbalanced is really bad

490
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,240
the second

491
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
issue is the

492
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,559
issue of independent samples

493
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,000
of course

494
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,120
we can

495
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,840
get

496
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,880
make the correlations

497
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,039
the two correlation related key

498
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,559
correlations

499
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,000
independent if we compute them over

500
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,240
independently chosen samples

501
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,880
in which case we need two end plaintexts

502
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,039
this is always possible

503
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,000
but

504
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
it will

505
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,960
double the number of plaintiffs

506
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,720
we need to do the analysis

507
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,799
with a single sample we need only n

508
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,400
plaintext

509
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,480
of course we need two and oracle calls

510
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,440
to get the ciphertext

511
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,080
so in other words with two independent

512
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,840
samples we need two n

513
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,960
plain text ciphertext pairs

514
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,039
but with a single sample

515
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,400
we need n

516
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,919
triples

517
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,440
of plain text ciphertext computed with

518
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,720
one key

519
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,840
and ciphertext computed with the related

520
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,039
key

521
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,360
so the data

522
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,840
data requirement is smaller if we can

523
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,559
use independent samples and

524
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,559
thanks to our analysis

525
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,760
now we know exactly how to handle

526
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
handle

527
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,720
signal sample case

528
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,960
so conclusion

529
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,600
um we have revisited statistical

530
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,440
premises of related key linear

531
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,520
cryptanalysis

532
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,840
and

533
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,559
shown that the signal sample option is

534
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,159
legal we showed how to handle it

535
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,320
we

536
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,039
confirmed the model

537
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,679
for correlation difference for random

538
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,440
functions

539
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,640
which

540
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,840
hasn't

541
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,200
really been proven before

542
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,799
and

543
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,080
we also

544
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,559
would i did not go into the little in

545
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,200
this talk but in the paper we also

546
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,760
discussed extension to multiple linear

547
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,600
cryptanalysis

548
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,480
and so that it can also work under the

549
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,360
assumption that the

550
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,080
linear approximations used in this

551
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,000
analysis are

552
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,400
independent

553
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,679
we also

554
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,720
discussed a little bit of extensions to

555
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,600
multi-dimensional linear capacities

556
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,520
but so some obstacles there

557
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,640
actually

558
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,919
it looks that the analysis if we want to

559
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,440
uh

560
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,520
it looks quite complicated to handle

561
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,280
this issue and therefore it's left for

562
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,679
future work

563
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,840
so i wish to thank you for your

564
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,360
attention

565
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,640
and

566
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,600
see you

567
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,840
at the conference
