00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,600
hello my name is william kim from south

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,720
korea

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,759
and my presentation title is cooking toy

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,360
cover even mensah cyprus

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,599
my content

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,799
is like this

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,880
for introduction i won't give you my

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,359
research motivation starting with

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,600
authenticated encryption

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
then introduce tree cover block cipher

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and poke cipher

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,400
at the end of introduction i will show

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,119
you my contribution

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,520
because my research is in polaroid

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,120
create scope

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,000
i also want to give you my probe sketch

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
briefly

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,919
introduction section

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,800
i think everyone here are familiar with

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,879
authenticated encryption

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,199
authenticated encryption is a type of

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,280
cryptographic scheme

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,760
death service encryption and message

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,879
authenticated code

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,720
this scheme assures privacy and

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,360
integrity on the later and there are

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,280
many instructions on how to make

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,439
authenticated encryption

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,680
the primary researcher's broken stone

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,320
combining encryption schemes and mac

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,040
mac then encrypt megan encrypt encrypt

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,200
and mac are another example

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,880
but it is natural

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,960
that directly making authenticated

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,840
encryption scheme will be more efficient

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,119
that combining two different schemes

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,920
ocb is representative authenticated

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,320
encryption scheme

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,840
aead

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,640
authenticated encryption with associated

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,200
data is somewhat developed version of

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,439
authenticated encryption

43
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,479
it has additional input associated data

44
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,680
that doesn't demand privacy but demand

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,280
integrity

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,320
by adding associated data aead can

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,759
perform every cryptographic functions

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,280
if you want mac

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,758
you can make only associated data input

50
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,360
and get tag

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,680
if you want encryption you can make

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,760
message input and get cycle text

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,239
for authenticated encryption you can

54
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,800
make message input and get ciphertext

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
and text

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
the question starts here

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,080
because aead contains all symmetric

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,040
scriptobic structures

59
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,519
if someone wants to make aeid the

60
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,360
primitive doesn't have to be a block

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
cipher

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,160
from this idea many researchers studied

63
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,840
new cryptographic primitives

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,959
to recover block cipher is a pioneer

65
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,599
t car block cipher has additional input

66
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,959
compared to block cipher.3

67
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,680
twig is a verbally input that makes

68
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,360
usability on the block cipher zeta cb is

69
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,760
the representative 3-core blockchain per

70
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,080
based aead

71
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,480
it makes some revision on ocb

72
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,840
and in

73
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,319
2019 the next primitive arrives pog

74
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,840
cipher makes

75
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,480
additional output to 3 cover block

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,360
cipher it seems that the message input

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,560
is propped

78
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,879
to two different outputs c0 and c1

79
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,640
that's why the cipher is the book cipher

80
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,799
the arsenal of the poco cipher or

81
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,799
suggested corresponding aead

82
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:49,040
paef is one of that like the light below

83
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,000
this is the table for aead according to

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,640
primitive ciphers

85
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,760
these aead schemes are the most basic

86
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,799
aead schemes you can see ocv has a

87
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,599
birthday band and the others have full

88
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,400
security the authors of folk cipher

89
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,360
emphasizes that

90
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,959
p-a-e-f has no content for cyphercore

91
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,600
that means fast and short message

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,840
from here we started our research

93
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,560
focus cipher was new cryptography

94
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,680
limited

95
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,800
therefore there were no research on folk

96
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,199
cipher with probably security

97
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,120
perspective

98
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,919
we said provocative model for focus

99
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,880
hyper

100
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,680
and also the most simple poke cypher

101
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,360
structure ftem prot c cover even measure

102
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,040
and we probe ftm has two thirds of n

103
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,960
bits qt

104
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,600
which means poking do not degrade the

105
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,160
security

106
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,680
next our security proof section

107
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,720
we first want to show you how we

108
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,199
construct ftm structure

109
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,680
below is two round even menstrual

110
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,080
construction

111
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,320
in 2015

112
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,479
the security for two round t couple

113
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,199
events reconstruction is probed

114
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,400
they substitute kiss in even answers to

115
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,680
twitchy

116
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,199
we don't make detail about tweak today

117
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,520
from 2round tem we made ftm structure

118
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,080
like this

119
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,280
because two-round tem uses two different

120
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,560
permutation

121
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,800
and two three keys

122
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,759
we made poke on two round tm with one

123
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,320
more permutation and tweaky

124
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,039
if you think one lounge tem as

125
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,080
permutation with masking tricky at port

126
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
and backward

127
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,319
ftm can be thought as

128
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,319
one round tem then poke and one land tm

129
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,319
respectively

130
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,479
in for our security when we say some

131
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,280
construction is secure it means the

132
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,639
construction is indistinguishable with

133
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,520
ideal random construction

134
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,000
for a block cipher it will be random

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,280
permutation

136
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,600
and for a three-core block cipher it

137
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,400
will be random to color permutation

138
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,199
then

139
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,319
for book

140
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,560
to recover block cipher

141
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,319
what is its ideal geometry construction

142
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,360
we made it as two concatenated twig

143
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,800
covers permutation

144
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,160
in means if you made construction query

145
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,440
to ideal world oracle

146
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,319
the oracle returns two outputs of

147
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,120
different three cover permutations tilde

148
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,479
q and tilde r

149
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,120
we probed secretive ftm with

150
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,199
h-e-coefficient technique

151
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,520
briefly speaking eight equivalent

152
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,319
technique separates all possible events

153
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,960
with bad and good case

154
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
then overbounding bad case probability

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,599
and good case priority difference

156
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,360
we can prove its security

157
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,960
we show the brief sketch of our proof

158
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,000
we have five web cases and this slide

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,039
shows

160
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,520
representative four cases

161
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,199
because permutation p1 p2 and p3 are

162
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,960
public permutations

163
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,800
there can exist

164
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,280
collision with permutation and fdem

165
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,120
structure

166
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,720
and ftm users uses 3t

167
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,759
there can also exist collision between

168
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,319
distinct ftm queries

169
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,800
the blackboard means collision between

170
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,960
ft and permutation

171
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,520
and whiteboard means collision between

172
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,000
ft and queries

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,759
for example

174
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,560
red string means two different ftm

175
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,520
queries made collision with permutation

176
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,319
chords individually

177
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,520
and make whiteboard correlation

178
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,680
between them at another permutation

179
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,720
with these base cases we could obtain

180
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,440
bad red probability and good probability

181
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,039
difference like below

182
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,159
the total security is like this it seems

183
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,080
somewhat complicated

184
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,719
but the point is it has

185
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,919
two thirds of n bit security same with

186
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,399
two round immenser

187
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,279
the tm paper showed tweaking do not

188
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,279
degrade the dodge q2 with two round

189
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,800
dimensior and we showed poking also do

190
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,800
not degrade each security

191
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,120
this is our summary

192
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,920
book cipher is a cipher that has one

193
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,240
input and two output

194
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,160
and efficient in short message aead

195
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,120
and booked 3 cover inventor the most

196
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
simple model of box cipher

197
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,720
is two thirds of n bit security

198
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,800
same order with

199
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,279
two round immenser

200
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,680
and there are some natural way to expand

201
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
our lizard

202
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
extend the poke round

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,839
or multiport

204
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,600
and multi-user security

205
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,160
my presentation is over and thank you

206
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,319
for listening
