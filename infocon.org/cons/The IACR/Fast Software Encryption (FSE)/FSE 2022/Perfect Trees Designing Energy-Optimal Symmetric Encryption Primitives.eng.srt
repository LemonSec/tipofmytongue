12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,120
the energy consumption of cryptographic

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,320
algorithms in hardware is a key aspect

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,719
when it comes to their integration into

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,840
low resource environments

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,600
this fact is further supported by the

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,280
ongoing nist lightweight cryptography

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,360
standardization process in which energy

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,680
consumption is one of the selection

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,680
criteria

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,760
the cryptographic literature features a

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,319
handful of works that investigate the

23
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,960
energy consumption landscape of hardware

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,119
ciphers

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,360
trailbraces in this regard were the

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,680
papers by kakov in 2012 and patina in

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,200
2013

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,680
both of which benchmark various block

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,320
ciphers and hardware with a particular

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,039
focus on energy

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,479
in 2016 bonik devised an energy model

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,720
for r-round on-road block ciphers as a

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,000
quasi-quadratic equation

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,040
where big r denotes the total number of

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,119
rounds in the block cipher and the

36
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,079
constants encode various circuit aspects

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,280
in 2018 bonic identified stream ciphers

38
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,439
as the most suitable choice when it

39
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,600
comes to the encryption of larger

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,719
quantities of data

41
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,000
in particular among the investigated

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,520
stream ciphers

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,640
trivium outperformed all other schemes

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,199
including supposedly efficient block

45
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,599
ciphers

46
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,760
nevertheless those results were

47
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,920
observational in nature and the

48
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,160
comprehensive energy model for stream

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,520
ciphers remained at large

50
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,520
in our work we will fill this gap and in

51
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,920
the process propose a straightforward

52
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,400
recipe for designing energy optimal

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,760
hardware stream ciphers

54
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,040
it is important to note that the reason

55
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,440
why a heuristic energy model for stream

56
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,640
cipher is harder to conceive is due to

57
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,440
the higher degrees of r which enormously

58
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,760
complicate the underlying algebraic

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,720
expressions and does their study

60
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,599
in contrast for block ciphers r is

61
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,200
usually relatively small

62
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,840
spelling out our contributions

63
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,159
we devise the first heuristic energy

64
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,720
model in the realm of stream ciphers

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,200
that links the algebraic topology of the

66
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,519
update function to the consumptive

67
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,480
behavior which is applicable to a wide

68
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
range of trivium-like

69
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,959
grain-like and subterranean-like

70
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,280
constructions

71
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,840
a building block of our energy model is

72
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,000
re-implementing all-round unrolled

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,400
trivium by tessellating the update

74
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,640
function strands into individual

75
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,599
circuits which yields a more gradual and

76
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,239
slower power consumption increase with

77
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,680
respect to the unrolling degree

78
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,959
this then provides a natural sac for our

79
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,000
energy model

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,400
secondly we leveraged this model and

81
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,879
proposed a new energy optimal stream

82
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,000
ciphers

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,080
in the trivium family that reduced the

84
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,280
energy consumption by up to 25

85
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,200
compared to the original specification

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,680
more importantly however for the first

87
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,400
time it is now possible to design stream

88
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,959
ciphers that specifically optimize for

89
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,959
energy

90
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,720
power slash energy consumption in

91
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,519
semiconductor circuits is due to two

92
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,440
main sources

93
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,040
static

94
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,120
this is leakage current and other

95
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,280
currents drawn continuously from the

96
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,639
power source

97
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,080
and dynamic

98
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
charge and discharge of load

99
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,479
capacitances ie 0 to 1 and 1 to 0

100
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,120
transitions

101
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,720
power is the rate of energy consumption

102
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,199
in other words energy is approximately

103
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,919
equal to the product of the average

104
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,880
power and the execution time which is

105
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,840
simply the time integral over the

106
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
power by this logic the energy

107
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,479
consumption should be independent of the

108
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,039
actual clock frequency

109
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,440
a fast clock leads to a smaller

110
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,440
execution time but higher average power

111
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,320
and analogously a slow clock increases

112
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,960
the execution time but yields a lower

113
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,919
power consumption

114
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,440
let us now transition to the meat of the

115
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,720
paper

116
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,120
the trivium update function consists of

117
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,440
three independent logic blocks t1 t2 and

118
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,639
t3

119
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,080
tapped from the state register x1 to x

120
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,880
288

121
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,680
we define each individual logic block as

122
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,320
a strand of the following form

123
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,919
a plus b

124
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,759
plus c times d

125
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,240
plus e

126
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,960
a feature rich library with three pinned

127
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,000
linear cells can implement one strand

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
with three gates

129
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,680
one two input nand

130
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,880
one two input xor and one free input xlr

131
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,520
hence the entire trivium combinatorial

132
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,639
layer then consists of 10 gates

133
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,160
three strands and one free input xor for

134
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,800
the key bit generation

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,400
investigated several circuits and

136
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,800
compilation directives supported by the

137
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,840
synopsis design compiler

138
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,960
regular

139
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,880
a run-of-the-mill synthesis of the

140
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,039
entire circuit that leads it up to the

141
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,919
tool to map the individual entities into

142
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,400
valid circuits

143
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,600
ultra

144
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,840
a high effort routine that optimizes

145
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,240
circuit area while not just

146
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,639
respecting entity boundaries

147
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,120
and finally restricted

148
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,360
where each update function strand is

149
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,840
synthesized individually using three

150
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,840
gates as mentioned before above

151
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,759
we observe that the restricted mode

152
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,560
outperformed other directives moving the

153
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,479
point of optimality

154
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,680
to r equals 288

155
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,720
in bonniex paper from

156
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,360
2018

157
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,840
the optimal degree of unrolling was

158
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,280
reported as r equals to

159
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,080
160 using the regular synthesis tool

160
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,400
option

161
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,560
this trend is clearly seen in the

162
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,199
following example using the 90 nanometer

163
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,800
tsmc cell library

164
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,039
plotted is the energy consumption for

165
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,080
the encryption of 1.28 million bits of

166
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,199
data

167
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,759
for all three synthesis directors

168
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,400
different unrolling degrees of art

169
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,679
and clock frequencies

170
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,879
having established that tribune benefits

171
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,440
from a restricted compilation approach

172
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,160
in which each state each update function

173
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,199
strength is synthesized individually let

174
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,199
us investigate this avenue more

175
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,759
thoroughly

176
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,879
it is not hard to see that we can

177
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,280
recursively enumerate the strands for

178
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,360
each unrolling degree bar

179
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,840
namely t1 of r t2 of r and t3 of r

180
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,400
recall that in the fully unrolled

181
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,160
setting ie when r is equal to 288

182
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,159
there are three times 288 equals 864

183
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,360
strands

184
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,679
each of them is composed of three logic

185
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,519
gates after synthesis

186
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,679
hence it is relatively straightforward

187
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,839
to measure the power consumption of each

188
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,240
strand

189
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
plotted are the singled out power

190
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,080
measurements for each strand ti of r

191
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,839
using the tsmc 90 nanometer cell library

192
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,720
intuitively we would expect the power in

193
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
the strands to increase

194
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,160
monotonously with r as in block ciphers

195
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,959
but the figure clearly suggests that the

196
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,320
increase is far from monotonous

197
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
the red data points represent the

198
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
strands

199
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,080
whose power consumption experiences a

200
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,640
sudden dip

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,320
this phenomenon also occurs for

202
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,000
different cell libraries such as

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,440
non-gate 15 nanometer or umc 65

204
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,320
nanometer and this does inherent to the

205
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,880
structure of the restricted unrolled

206
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,439
trivial circuit

207
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,880
why is this

208
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,680
a first observation is the fact that all

209
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,600
t one of r for one for r bigger equal

210
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,000
one smaller equals 66

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,760
consume the same power until t1 of 67

212
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,240
whose power consumption is considerably

213
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,720
larger

214
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,440
all inputs to t1 of r for re bigger

215
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,480
equal one smaller equal 66

216
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,800
come directly from the register

217
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,600
thus in some sense their input nodes are

218
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,079
all at the distance 0 from the register

219
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,000
however one of the inputs of t1 of 67

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,040
comes from the output of t3 of 1

221
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,880
and thus not all its inputs are at

222
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,720
distance 0 from the register

223
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,000
this delay in balance the input virus

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
gives rise to more glitches into

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,399
internal circuitry of t1 of 67 and thus

226
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,640
hints at one of the reasons why it

227
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,600
consumes more

228
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,360
further consider the boundary around r

229
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
equals to 93

230
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
at r equals to 94 the power consumption

231
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,200
of t1 of 94 drops

232
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,519
it is easy to see that all the inputs of

233
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,880
t1 of 94 are at the distance 2 from the

234
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,560
register whereas the inputs of t193 are

235
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,399
still imbalanced with respect to the

236
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,920
delay from the register

237
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,880
it appears that that balanced strands

238
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,920
consume less power than unbalanced ones

239
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,860
more formally

240
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,880
[Music]

241
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,800
the circuit strands are connected

242
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,360
naturally in a well-defined graphical

243
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
topology

244
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,440
each unrolled strand can be translated

245
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,839
into a five area tree

246
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,320
with the root node as the output bit

247
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,040
whose subtrees or other unrolled strand

248
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,920
trees or leaf nodes

249
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,440
let capital t of i of r be the five are

250
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,920
unrolled strand three corresponding to

251
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,399
the unrolled strand equation t i of r

252
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,279
the child nodes of the strand capital t

253
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,240
i of r are there for all the five nodes

254
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,639
capital t j of u for which the

255
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,000
corresponding terms tj of u are present

256
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,240
in its recursive definition from before

257
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,360
to make the link between unroll strand

258
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,560
equations

259
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,040
their respective trees clear we give

260
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,480
free examples of varying complexity

261
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,120
displayed are the unrolls german trees

262
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,279
capital t3 of 1

263
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,600
capital t3 of 100 and capital t3 of 200.

264
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,519
we say that a perfect m ary tree is a

265
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,920
tree in which all non-leaf nodes have

266
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,639
and children and all leaf nodes are at

267
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,519
the same depth

268
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,720
the unrolled strand trees in tripium are

269
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,000
five airy

270
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,440
capital t3 of one and capital t3

271
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,959
of 200

272
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,680
are perfect honorable strategies while

273
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,519
capital t3 of 100 is imperfect due to

274
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,680
having leaf nodes at different depths

275
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,959
clearly capital t1 of 66 capital t1 of

276
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,880
94 were perfect trees whereas capital t1

277
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,880
of 67 and capital t1 of 93 were not

278
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,880
a strand evidently consumes less power

279
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,200
if the node it occupies in the circ

280
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,440
graph houses a perfect tree

281
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,720
in the baseline tribune design there are

282
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,279
339 perfect unrolled strand trees

283
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,360
thus less than half of all trees

284
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,480
this raises the question of what happens

285
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
when the tap positions of trivium are

286
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,519
altered in such a way as to obtoin

287
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,240
obtain configurations that yield more

288
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,079
perfect on-roll strategies

289
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,279
plotted is the power consumption of

290
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,880
several hundred trivium-like

291
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,040
constructions that differ from the

292
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,600
original specification in the position

293
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,120
after 9 taps

294
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,000
using the umc 65 nanometer cell library

295
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,560
the tendency of higher number of perfect

296
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
unrolled strand trees with respect to

297
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,639
the power consumption is clearly

298
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,639
demarcated

299
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,279
having established a strong correlation

300
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,000
between the power slash energy energy

301
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,040
consumption of random trivial instances

302
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,279
their corresponding total number of

303
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,000
perfect unrolled strand trees

304
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,079
we can commence to look for potential

305
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,240
tribune-like derivatives with different

306
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,720
tab positions that consume less energy

307
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,199
the search space over all potential tab

308
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,680
positions is too large to fully

309
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,959
enumerate

310
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,360
hence we limit the candidate space as

311
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,760
follows

312
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,639
all linear tab positions are chosen from

313
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,120
a multiple of three as was the case in

314
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,800
the original tribune construction

315
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,279
the location of the non-linear caps are

316
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,320
not a multiple of three

317
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,880
the leftmost tab of each of the gister

318
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,240
is at least at position 64

319
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,120
to ensure easy parallelization until r

320
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,320
equals to 64.

321
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,560
these three filtering criteria allow us

322
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
to reduce the number of candidates to

323
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,638
roughly 2 to the power 25

324
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,279
out of all those potential candidate

325
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,160
constructions we picked two promising

326
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,079
energy efficient trivium replacements

327
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,320
trivium lef

328
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,040
this design features 495

329
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,680
perfect trees and an equivalent security

330
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,519
level as the baseline trivium

331
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,360
specification

332
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,000
it reduces the overall energy

333
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,279
consumption by 15

334
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,240
trivium les with 665

335
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,600
perfect trees

336
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,360
this design reduces the energy

337
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,519
consumption by 25

338
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,000
across different cell libraries at a

339
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,720
custom of more initialization runs to

340
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,199
reach a comparable security level with

341
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,479
trivium lef

342
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,399
both proposals stand as the current most

primitives known in the literature

345
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,360
depicted is the register structure of

346

tribune lef

347
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,240
note that the individual sizes of the

348
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,320
registers are more balanced than in

349
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,639
trivium which is a good heuristic to

350
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,120
obtain more perfect unrolled strand

351
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,720
trees

352
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,560
further note that the placement of the

353
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,759
left most tabs is shifted towards

354
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,839
the middle of the register to allow for

355
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,399
more perfect enrolls to entries of depth

356
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,720
one

357
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,279
the perfect tree phenomenon translates

358
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,119
seamlessly to other existing

359
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,919
trivium-like string ciphers

encryption

and triad sc a former first throne in

this lwc candidate

370
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,520
our model is even extendable to

371
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,679
non-trivium-like designs and ciphers

372
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,000
that follow the crane or subterranean

373
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
philosophies

374
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,960
in retrospect in this paper we propose

375
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,200
the first heuristic energy model for

376
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,880
stream ciphers

377
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,720
applicable to a wide range of

378
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,520
constructions

379
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,640
our model opens the door for the design

380
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,039
of future energy efficient stream cipher

381
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,120
designs

382
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,400
meanwhile we propose two new energy

383
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,559
optimal trivium-like stream ciphers that

384
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,480
consume 15

385
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,039
and 25 percent lenergy

386
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,720
less energy than the baseline

387
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,720
