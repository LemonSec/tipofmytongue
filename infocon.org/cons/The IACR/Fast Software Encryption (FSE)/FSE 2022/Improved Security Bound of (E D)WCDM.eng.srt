hi

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,759
i am avijit dharta

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,679
i am going to present our work improve

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,360
security bound of ewcdm and dwcdm

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,200
it's a joint fork with nilanjan dartha

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,800
and kushankul datta

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
we are all from institute for advancing

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,359
intelligence tcg crest

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,920
this paper mainly studies different kind

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,960
of non-space map constructions

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,279
therefore we begin our talk with the

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,519
popular non-space mac construction which

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,320
is known as wetland cutter mac

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,559
so wegman cotton mac was proposed by

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,520
wegman and carter

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,879
this mac

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,040
takes the message in

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,440
which is hashed through a hash function

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,960
h k

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,680
and the hash value is then randomly

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,719
masked to generate the tag

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,960
to generate the random string

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,920
we apply a pseudonym function on

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,740
distinct nouns n

25
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,280
[Music]

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,399
this mac

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,040
gives optimal security bound

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,560
in particular

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,520
when all the nonces are distinct across

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,960
different queries

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,400
then it achieves

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,040
epsilon times qv security bound where

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
epsilon is the almost zero universal

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,360
probability of the underlying kid hash

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,759
function and qv is the number of

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,840
verification attempts that an adversary

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,600
can make

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,720
however

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,240
an inherent drawback of this

40
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,400
construction is that

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,119
if the nonce is reused

42
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,240
for once

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,400
then the construction does not give any

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,759
security

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,439
so security of this construction is

46
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,920
completely lost in the non-missive

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,479
scenario

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,840
to solve this problem

49
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,880
one natural solution was to encrypt the

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,200
output of the wegman quarterback and

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,280
thus the resulting construction is known

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,399
as encrypted wegman quarterback

53
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,640
the security bound of this encrypted

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,040
rickman cutter mech is as good as the

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,560
wegman cutter

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,040
in particular it gives the optimal

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,038
security bound in the non-suspecting

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,080
setting

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,720
and additionally it gives beyond above

60
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,800
the bound security and the non-mission

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
setting

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,560
however

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,480
the pseudo-random function is rarely

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
available in practice

65
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
so therefore

66
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,319
one can think of to replace this pseudo

67
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,000
random function with a cellular random

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,480
permutation

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,480
now if you replace this pseudo-random

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,599
function with a pseudo-random

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,800
permutation

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,040
then the resulting construction will not

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
give adequate security

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,400
in particular if you replace this fk

75
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,959
with an block cipher e k

76
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,280
then in the non respective setting the

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,360
security of the resulting construction

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
will drop down to the birthday bound

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,519
because

80
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,879
if you replace this fk with ek

81
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,519
then an adversary can make

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,319
too many queries where all the nonces in

83
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,000
these queries will be distinct and the

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,080
message will be same

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,720
therefore all the queue inputs to the

86
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,800
second block cipher call will be

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,440
distinct and as a result of that all the

88
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,519
tags that he will obtain will also be

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,840
distinct

90
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,080
all the q distinct tags can be

91
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,319
distinguished from the uniform random

92
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,879
tags if if the adversary can make at

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,599
least 2 power n by 2 queries

94
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,080
therefore the prf security of the

95
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,280
construction

96
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,840
will only give the better route security

97
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
as a possible possible remedy of the

98
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,599
solution one can think of to instantiate

99
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,200
this pseudo-random function with the

100
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,799
popular sum of

101
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,280
some of pseudo-random permutation

102
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,799
and we know that the sum of

103
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,480
pseudo-random permutation

104
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,879
is a very good prf in particular it

105
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,200
gives the optimal security amount so

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,439
therefore if you replace the pseudo

107
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,920
random function fk with the sum of prp

108
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,760
construction then the resulting

109
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,239
construction will give optimal security

110
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,439
mount

111
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,720
but

112
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
this construction requires three block

113
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,400
cipher calls

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,880
therefore we ask that can we reduce the

115
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,000
number of block cipher calls

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,199
to answer this question in crypto 2016

117
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,600
cogniti and syrian proposed their

118
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
construction which is known as encrypted

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,880
wegman cutter with tv smear construction

120
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,440
in which the pseudo-random function of

121
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,400
ewc mac is instantiated by the key

122
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,479
dividement construction as follows

123
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,759
this mac

124
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,400
gives 20 by three bit max security in

125
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,880
the non-suspecting setting and n by two

126
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,160
bit security in the non-specific city

127
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,639
in this paper

128
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,960
cognate and syrian have conjectured that

129
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,240
their construction is secure even if the

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
adversary can make up to two power and

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,479
many queries in the non-suspecting

132
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,680
setting

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,240
they have also conjectured that if the

134
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,360
two block cipher keys become identical

135
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,440
there also the construction will retain

136
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,360
the same security in the non-suspecting

137
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,759
setting that means that the single kid

138
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,160
ewc dm construction will retain two

139
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,479
power to n by three bit security in

140
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,840
non-suspecting setting

141
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,639
in crypto 2017

142
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,199
manning and navs they proved the optimal

143
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,919
prf security of ewcdm construction in

144
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,759
non-suspecting setting

145
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,919
however their security proof was

146
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,320
essentially relied on patterns general

147
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
mirror theory technique

148
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
however the proof of general mirror

149
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
theory technique by beta rain

150
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,560
for two power n bound is still a matter

151
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,919
of defense

152
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,479
in dcc 18 cognate and student they

153
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,759
acknowledged that proving the security

154
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,240
of single kid ew serium is very hard

155
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,440
therefore we ask that can we design a

156
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,600
launch-based bbb secure mac with a

157
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,080
single block cipher

158
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,199
in crypto 2018 dutta at all proposed

159
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,880
their construction which is known as

160
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,560
decrypted wakeman carter with davis

161
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,919
mayor

162
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,720
in this construction notice that

163
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,639
the second block cipher call of the

164
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,960
ewcdm is now replaced with the inverse

165
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,720
of ek

166
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,319
so therefore the construction

167
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,400
essentially boils down to having a

168
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,560
single block cipher key

169
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,400
the authors have proved that their

170
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,840
construction is 2 1 by 3 bit max secure

171
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,160
in the non-suspecting setting and m by

172
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
2-bit max secure in the non-misused

173
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,280
setting

174
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,319
however

175
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,000
their construction

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,800
can take 2 and by 3-bit nonce

177
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,599
that means the launch space of the dwcm

178
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,840
construction was only restricted to 2

179
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
power 12x3 many

180
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,599
possibilities

181
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,280
however the security proof of the

182
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,440
construction was essentially reliant on

183
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,120
couple of assumptions of the underlying

184
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,520
hash function in particular

185
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,759
the underlying hash function needs to be

186
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,759
2 power minuses 2 power minus and

187
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,400
regular to power minus and 3 way regular

188
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
and it has to be 2 power minus n almost

189
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,120
all universal

190
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,960
in this paper we ask that can we improve

191
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,080
the security bound of ewcdm and dwcdm

192
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,639
because till now what we have seen that

193
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,520
these two constructions are secured only

194
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,440
about two and by three bits secured in

195
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,400
the non-stroking setting therefore we

196
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,280
study that if it is possible to improve

197
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,639
the security bomb of these two

198
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,880
constructions

199
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,960
to analyze the security bound to to

200
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,639
having the improved security bound of

201
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,560
these two constructions we first

202
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,680
discussed

203
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,080
the extended meter theory technique

204
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,479
so in extended media theory technique we

205
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,440
deal with

206
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,879
a system of equations and a

207
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,319
non-equations

208
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,240
so in the left hand side of this figure

209
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,080
we can see that there is a system of

210
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,000
bivariate defining equations

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,280
and in the right hand side there is a

212
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,000
system of bivariate affine non equations

213
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,759
and this system of equations and noun

214
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,840
equations are defined over say are many

215
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,599
variables

216
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,360
the goal of this extended mirror theory

217
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
is to lower bound the number of

218
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,720
solutions to the system of equations and

219
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,960
non-equations such that

220
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,039
all the variables all these are

221
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,120
variables they will be distinct

222
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,160
we can view the system of equations and

223
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,560
non-equation in terms of graph

224
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,960
when we represent the set of variables

225
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,279
as a set of vertices that means all the

226
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,958
variables can be

227
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,919
casted to a set of vertices

228
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,559
if two variables are associated to an

229
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,760
equation say p1 plus p2 equals to lambda

230
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,240
then we give and solid

231
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
red edge and that edge should be

232
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
undirected between the corresponding two

233
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,279
vertices

234
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,519
similarly if the two were two two

235
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,600
variables are associated through a

236
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,760
non-equation say p one plus p two is not

237
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,279
equals to lambda prime

238
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,560
then we put a dashed blue edge which is

239
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,480
obviously leveled and that should be

240
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
undirected between the corresponding two

241
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,640
vertices so for example here the

242
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,800
equation if we have an equation say p 1

243
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,640
plus v 2 goes to lambda

244
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,920
then we put

245
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,720
our solid red edge between the

246
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,440
corresponding vertices v 1 and v 2 with

247
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,600
a level c lambda

248
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,000
and if we have a non equation say p 1

249
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,720
plus p 2 not equals to lambda prime then

250
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,519
we put a dash blue edge

251
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,440
between v 1 and v 2 with the

252
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,000
corresponding label lambda prime

253
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,360
as an example we can see that we have a

254
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,279
system of equations that p 1 plus p 2

255
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,440
equals to lambda 1 and as a result of

256
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,200
that we put a

257
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
solid red edge between the vertices v 1

258
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,200
and v 2 with the corresponding level

259
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,320
lambda 1

260
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,480
and we have another equation p1 plus pc

261
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,399
equals to lambda 2 therefore we put

262
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,200
another edge between the vertices v1 and

263
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,480
v3

264
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,279
and the corresponding level lambda 2.

265
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,360
similarly we have a system of equations

266
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,279
and non-equations say p1 plus p2 equals

267
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,680
to lambda 1 and therefore we have put an

268
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,240
edge between what is vertex v1 and v2

269
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
with the level lambda 1 we have an

270
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
equation p3 plus v4 equals to lambda 2

271
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
therefore we have put an edge between v3

272
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,480
and v4 with the edge with the level

273
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,640
lambda 2 and we have a non-equation say

274
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,800
p2 plus p3 which is not equals to lambda

275
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,120
3 and therefore we have put an edge

276
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,680
between the vertex v2 and v3 and that is

277
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,560
a

278
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,040
dashed blue h with the corresponding

279
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,079
lambda 3.

280
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,040
so in this way we can cast a system of

281
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
equations and non-equations to an

282
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,120
equivalent graph

283
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,240
we say

284
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,440
that

285
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,560
a graph is bad if it satisfies either of

286
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,720
these following three conditions

287
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,959
the conditions are the following if the

288
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,920
graph contains a cycle

289
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,959
if

290
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,279
if you take any path in the graph let

291
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,600
the path be p

292
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,399
and if you sum up the edge levels of the

293
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,800
edges which are involved in the path

294
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,160
and if the sum is 0 then we say that the

295
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,839
graph is bad

296
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,120
and finally

297
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,399
if there is a cycle in the graph say c

298
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,200
that involves exactly one non-equation h

299
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
and we denote this non-equation edge

300
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,760
with a blue dashed edge

301
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,320
so if the cycle involves a non-equation

302
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,560
h say e

303
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,160
then

304
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,640
we will consider that graph to be bad

305
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,920
only if

306
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,880
the level of that non-equation edge

307
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,920
is the sum of the levels of the path p

308
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,720
where p is basically c minus e

309
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,200
so c is the cycle and e is the

310
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
non-equation h

311
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,000
so if you consider the path p which is c

312
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,360
minus e

313
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,760
then and if you take the sum of the

314
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,160
edges some of the levels of the edges

315
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,880
which are involved in the path p

316
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,680
and that thing is assigned as the level

317
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,399
of the non-equation age then we will

318
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,760
call that graph is bad

319
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,519
in this paper we have shown

320
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,600
this extended mirror theory result for

321
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,680
two types of graph

322
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,600
the first type is for a general graph

323
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,279
and the second type is for a bipartite

324
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,560
graph

325
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,480
we have shown that for a fixed good

326
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,920
general graph

327
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,279
the number of solutions to the

328
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,040
associated system of equation and

329
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,680
equation is at least 2 power n following

330
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,800
factorial s over to power mqm

331
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,399
times 1 minus some error term where s is

332
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,880
the number of vertices and q m is the

333
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,200
total number of edges

334
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,680
here qc is the total number of edges of

335
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,480
the sub graph of the graph g which is

336
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,720
generated if we just remove the non

337
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,639
equation edges from the graph g

338
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,079
so the sub graph

339
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,040
the generated sub graph say g prime

340
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,519
is generated out of the graph g

341
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,320
by deleting only the non equation edges

342
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
from the graph g

343
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,560
similarly we have shown

344
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,959
uh the following result of the extended

345
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,360
meta theory for a bipartite graph that

346
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
for a fixed code bipartite graph the

347
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,880
number of solutions to the associated

348
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
system of equation and non-equation is

349
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,800
at least two power n following factorial

350
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,040
sl times two power n following factorial

351
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,560
sr over two power n q m times one minus

352
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,839
some error term where sn is the number

353
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,560
of vertices of the left partition and a

354
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,000
sr is the number of vertices in the

355
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,240
right partition of the bipartite graph

356
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,880
and 2m is the total number of edges

357
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,839
similarly qc is the number of pages of

358
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,519
the sub graph which is generated out of

359
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,920
the graph g by deleting the non-equation

360
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,720
edges and here obviously this q v is the

361
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,480
total number of non-equation edges which

362
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,600
are present in the graph g

363
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,279
okay now we discuss briefly the what is

364
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,440
h coefficient technique so h coefficient

365
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
technique is a very powerful

366
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,519
combinatorial tool which is used to

367
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,360
bound the distinguishing advantage of

368
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,600
two random system so here we are

369
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,680
assuming that this two random system is

370
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,720
basically

371
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,000
uh this two algorithms this sign signing

372
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,440
algorithm and the verification algorithm

373
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,120
which are present in the real world and

374
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,040
in the ideal world we have

375
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,839
uh two random systems say the first one

376
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,480
is the random function and the

377
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,959
second one is a reject symbol

378
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,279
or the uh about oracle

379
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,880
okay so the signing so here is an

380
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
adversary that adversary is interacting

381
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,639
with the pair of oracles either in the

382
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,800
real world or in the ideal world so if

383
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,240
the adversary is interacting with the

384
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,680
real world then it has access to the

385
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,880
signing model and the verification

386
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,639
article and these two oracles are

387
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,240
basically the keyed oracles and the

388
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,399
adversary does not access to this key

389
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,320
does not have access to this key

390
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,920
and if the adversary is interacting with

391
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,839
this ideal world then it is actually

392
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,760
interacting with this random oracle and

393
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,160
the about oracle

394
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,240
so if the adversary is interacting with

395
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,720
the real world then if it queries with

396
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,560
the message m then the signing oracle

397
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
will get back will will

398
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,440
return the corresponding tag and if it

399
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,800
is interacting with the verification

400
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
oracle then the verification oracle will

401
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,279
either say yes or no depending on

402
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,440
whether the tag message tag pair is a

403
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,680
valid or not

404
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,600
in contrast if it is interacting with

405
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,839
the ideal world then if it queries to

406
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,000
the random oracle with say message f

407
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,920
then the random oracle will randomly

408
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,839
sample the tag

409
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,360
and if it

410
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,519
interacts with this about oracle with

411
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,720
the message tag pair m comma t then the

412
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,560
idea this this about oracle will always

413
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,480
return about

414
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,639
and the distinguishing advantage of this

415
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,800
adversary a to distinguish the real

416
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,480
world from the ideal one is defined

417
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,959
something like this

418
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,759
and to upper bound this advantage using

419
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,759
the edge coefficient technique one needs

420
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,759
to do this following three things first

421
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,720
of all

422
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,360
they have to identify the bad transcript

423
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,320
then

424
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,399
we need to i we need to up or down the

425
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,079
probability of the bad transcripts in

426
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,720
the ideal world and then if we fix a

427
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,120
good transcript then we have to lower

428
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,199
down the ratio of the real to ideal

429
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,040
interpolation probability for that good

430
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,630
transcript

431
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,920
[Applause]

432
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,600
so in detail so we denote this x re

433
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,120
which is the probability distribution of

434
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,199
the transcript induced in the real world

435
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,040
x id is the probability of distribution

436
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,839
of transcript in the ideal world and

437
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,720
math calculate which is denoted as the

438
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,360
this disjoint union of these two sets a

439
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,079
good t and bad d so that t is basically

440
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,160
the set of all that transcript and good

441
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,399
t is the set of all good transcript

442
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,639
so what is transcript so transcript is

443
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,240
basically the

444
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,399
summarization of the summary of the

445
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,079
interaction between the

446
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,279
adversary and the oracle

447
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,440
so having defined this wisdom state the

448
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,120
main theorem of the excavation technique

449
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,240
which says

450
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,600
that

451
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,560
there exists a positive number positive

452
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,440
real numbers epsilon ratio such that the

453
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,560
ratio of the internet of the of the

454
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,800
interpolation probability in the real

455
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,279
world and the ideal one is lower bounded

456
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,319
by one minus epsilon ratio and there

457
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,400
exist another positive real numbers

458
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,919
epsilon band such that this probability

459
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,480
that x id belongs to the set of that

460
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,720
transcript is upper bounded by epsilon

461
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,919
bar

462
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,199
then we can upper bound the advantage of

463
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,359
distinguishing these two random systems

464
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,760
real and ideal which is upper bounded by

465
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,520
the sum of these two quantities epsilon

466
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,780
ratio and epsilon band

467
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,200
[Applause]

468
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,320
okay

469
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
now using this h coefficient technique

470
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,600
we will prove the uh

471
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,919
we will we will prove the security bound

472
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,559
of ewcd

473
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,919
so one can cast the uh system or one can

474
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,480
cause the errors if evaluation of awcdm

475
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,400
to a system of equations and the

476
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,799
non-equations so in particular if you

477
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,280
have we we have the system of q and many

478
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,080
mac equation and qv many verification

479
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,200
equations

480
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,360
and one can naturally cast the system of

481
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,039
equation and non-equation to a

482
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,640
corresponding graph

483
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,360
where this lambda i is basically the sum

484
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,120
of noise and the hash value of the

485
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,919
message similarly lambda i prime is the

486
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,679
sum of the

487
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,440
nouns and the hash value of the message

488
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,080
where ini prime and the mi prime is the

489
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,760
credit uh

490
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,880
noise and the message in the

491
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,840
verification query

492
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,640
okay

493
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,960
now after this interaction is over the

494
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
trunk the transcript will be generated

495
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,880
and we then we will

496
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,720
partition this transcript into two sets

497
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,280
the bad set and the good set we say that

498
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,679
the transcript is bad if you take any

499
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,880
two queries

500
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,039
such that their t value collects and the

501
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,960
lambda value coils

502
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,559
look look at this equation that if you

503
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,280
cast this equation in terms of graph

504
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,799
then

505
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,360
we will not get any cycle

506
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,400
because

507
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,919
this n1 and n2 so these are all distinct

508
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,880
right

509
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,160
so if you take any two equations and for

510
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,320
these two equations if their t value

511
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,919
matches and the corresponding lambda

512
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,120
value matches

513
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,760
then since p 1 is a permutation then

514
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,600
therefore this end value will be matched

515
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,360
but since we are proving this security

516
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,039
in the non-respecting setting so this

517
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,280
situation cannot arise in the real world

518
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,039
so this situation can only occur in the

519
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,840
ideal world therefore that event will

520
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
distinguish it from the random system or

521
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,120
from the ideal world

522
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,400
so therefore we take this

523
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,520
we take this event to be bad

524
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,559
number two is that once we cast this

525
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,640
equation in terms of graph it will

526
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,799
basically leads to different components

527
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,120
and we bound the size of the component

528
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,880
in particular we say

529
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,039
that if the generator if the if the size

530
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,880
of the generator component is at least q

531
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,200
m to the power 2 by 3 then we call the

532
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,120
transcript is bad

533
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,440
and finally if we have a fortunate

534
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,760
attempt such that

535
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,320
the the corresponding uh nonce and the

536
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,799
tag collides and also the hash value of

537
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,039
codes that means suppose an adversary

538
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,280
queries which say n prime t prime and m

539
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,080
prime such that m plane is

540
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,039
is matched to some previous varied nodes

541
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,200
t plane match with the corresponding

542
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,159
obtained tag and eventually the hash

543
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,000
value of the message which is queried

544
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,080
with the message m prime that has also

545
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,440
been collided

546
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,039
if these three things happens then we

547
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,000
will say

548
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,559
that the transcript is bad

549
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,039
so if the transcript is not bad

550
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,120
that means for a good transcript and if

551
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,880
you have a good transcript then we can

552
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,360
also generate a good graph i mean we can

553
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,600
also generate a graph and that graph

554
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
will be good graph so one can easily

555
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,679
identify that the structure of good

556
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,280
graph will be something like this that

557
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,360
means it will be a cyclic

558
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,000
and the size of the components will be

559
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,640
at most q m to the power two by three

560
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,080
and therefore we can apply the military

561
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,000
for this code graph and obviously one

562
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,919
one should note that these graphs are

563
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,760
actually the bipartite graphs

564
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,440
so therefore we can apply this mirror

565
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,360
theory for the bipartite graph to lower

566
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,039
bound the real interpolation probability

567
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,679
next we come to the overview of the

568
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,760
security proof of dwcm

569
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,840
so as we have written down the mac

570
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,440
equation and the verification equation

571
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
for ewcdm we can similarly write down

572
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
the math equation and the verification

573
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,559
into it verification equation for the

574
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,760
wcdm

575
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,840
so again we have this qm mini mac

576
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,520
equation and the qv many verification

577
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,720
equations

578
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,679
and generally one can ah cast this

579
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,880
system of math equation and the

580
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,080
verification equation in terms of graph

581
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,320
again we identify the bad graph and the

582
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,480
code graph

583
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,080
so we say that a

584
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,320
graph is bad if

585
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,919
any of these following conditions is

586
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,559
satisfied so the first condition says

587
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,960
that if the component size of the

588
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
magraph is at least 5

589
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,880
if it contains a cycle

590
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,840
or if it contains a path of length 3

591
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,120
such that their level sum is 0

592
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,399
and if there is a

593
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,919
graph

594
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,600
of

595
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,720
if there is an edge with a level 0 if

596
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,240
there is an age in a magnet 0.

597
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,159
there are some of the additional uh bad

598
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,880
events so for example if the map graph

599
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,200
contains a cycle that includes a dashed

600
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
blue edge

601
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
there are other another additional bad

602
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,440
events that means say for example if we

603
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,520
take two macquaries

604
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,120
such that their tag collides and the

605
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,440
lambda value also collides or the

606
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,120
nonsense the tag collides or and the

607
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,360
lambda value colors

608
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
the number of pair of mac queries such

609
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,960
that the n and p collides or t the

610
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,039
the two tag collides it's at least q m

611
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,799
to the power two by three

612
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,120
or there's a mac query such that the tag

613
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,480
is zero

614
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,400
if none of these bad events happen then

615
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,840
the corresponding transcript will be

616
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,000
good and if you uh

617
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
cast this transcript in terms of graph

618
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,240
then we will land up with this good

619
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,360
graphs

620
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,039
and therefore we can apply this meta

621
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,880
theory for the general graph to lower

622
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,320
down the real interpolation probability

623
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,200
for such good graphs

624
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
next we look at some of the glimpses of

625
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,880
the bounding bad events

626
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,760
so we first say that there's about so so

627
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,919
there is a component of size at least

628
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:20,799
five

629
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,440
so if we have a component of at least 5

630
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,480
then

631
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,799
we will we will have this many

632
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,799
possibilities

633
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,280
and we have shown that bounding of this

634
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,080
event is to power qm over 2 power 3 n by

635
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,880
4

636
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,320
where qf is the number of uh total edges

637
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,919
of the map of the of the corresponding

638
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,600
graph

639
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
the second even is a bounding cycle in a

640
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,760
mag graph so in order to bounce cycle in

641
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,960
a magnet we have these four

642
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,120
possibilities okay we will not have a

643
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,960
cycle of length five because we have

644
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,520
already bounded that the component size

645
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,159
is of at least five so if we have a

646
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,159
component of size five then that

647
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,760
actually reduces to this first event

648
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,919
and we have shown that the bound of this

649
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,679
event is maximum of this

650
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,559
the third event is that the bounding my

651
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,880
graph having a path of length three with

652
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,360
level sum zero so we have these two

653
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,720
possibilities

654
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,880
and for that again we have our desired

655
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,120
mount

656
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,679
for bounding my graph that that contains

657
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,080
a cycle which actually includes a dash

658
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,559
blue edge that means we have a cycle

659
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,720
but that cycle includes exactly one

660
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,960
non-equation edge or a dash blue edge

661
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,200
and we have this so so in this case we

662
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,520
have categorized it into three steps so

663
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,880
first the bounding self loop and

664
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,039
parallel images for this we have so self

665
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,200
rule is for one possibility for bounding

666
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,559
parallel edges we have this following

667
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,400
two possibilities and for each of these

668
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,159
cases we have seen that this bound is in

669
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,640
our desired range

670
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,120
next we bound the triangles

671
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,640
so for triangles we have these three

672
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,720
following possibilities and for each of

673
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,720
them we have shown that this bound is

674
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,400
again in our desired range so in

675
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,120
particular the bound is qv times epsilon

676
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,480
3 rate

677
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,799
the maximum of qb times epsilon 3 day

678
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,480
and qm over 2 power 5 n by 4.

679
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,360
finally we have the

680
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,880
we have this case of bounding the

681
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,240
squares because

682
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,960
again we are essentially uh bounding the

683
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,720
background which will contain a cycle

684
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,159
that includes a

685
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,880
dash blue h so we will have a bounding

686
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,640
we will have this structure of square

687
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,840
and we have this following three

688
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,320
possibilities and for that we have shown

689
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
that our bound that we have obtained is

690
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,799
in our desired range note that we will

691
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,120
not go for will not go beyond this

692
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,520
because if we go beyond this then again

693
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,640
that will include uh

694
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,320
that actually reduces to those

695
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,919
possibilities

696
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,600
to component of size at least five

697
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,480
okay so finally uh we want just to make

698
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,919
a remark that how our proof is different

699
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,320
from the original dwcm proof ok so in

700
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,679
the original dwcdm proof the authors

701
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,919
have

702
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,159
authors have casted the system of

703
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,600
equations to a graph in a different

704
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,039
terminology so they have

705
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,039
they have represented a vertex to be an

706
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,039
equation and they put an

707
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,960
edge between two vertices

708
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,840
if the corresponding equations share a

709
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,960
variable

710
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,279
but in our setting what we have done

711
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,480
that we

712
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
we have represented a vertex as a

713
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,400
variable in of the corresponding system

714
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,799
of equation and non-equation and we have

715
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,080
put an edge between two vertices if

716
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,799
these two variables are associated by an

717
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,159
equation

718
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,559
so if we cast their representation in

719
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,120
terms of our terminology then the

720
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,799
corresponding bad events that was

721
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,640
generated in the original database cdm

722
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,120
proof is of other followings that the

723
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,279
windows graph contains a cycle any

724
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,039
components in the induced web contains a

725
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,720
path of length at least three and

726
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,320
induced graph contains a cycle that

727
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,640
includes a non-equation edge whereas in

728
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,960
our bad events we induced a graph that

729
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,120
contains a circuit but the second

730
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,960
condition is different that we are

731
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,400
actually allowing

732
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,440
the

733
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,200
we are actually allowing the path of

734
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,080
length at least three but not beyond

735
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,600
four

736
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
okay so here we are actually align that

737
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,360
the path can be three

738
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,279
or more than 3 but it should not go

739
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,720
beyond 4.

740
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,480
moreover the induced graph contains a

741
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,080
cycle that includes a non-equation age

742
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,159
okay so to conclude this talk we have

743
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,880
shown the 3x4 bit security of ewcdm and

744
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,799
dwcm

745
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,760
ah

746
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
in fact the optimal security of these

747
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,240
two construction can be proven

748
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,399
if you use the general result of

749
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,399
patterns mirror theory

750
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,480
but again the

751
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,440
the correctness of the general uh

752
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,840
general result of media theory is not

753
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,760
established yet

754
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,919
uh proof of this optimal security of

755
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,320
dwcdm requires underlying hash to be

756
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,640
regular so for ewcd if you want to prove

757
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,960
the optimal security of ewcdm then the

758
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,039
hash function i mean the almost all

759
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,799
universal property of the other lane

760
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,880
hash function is sufficient but if you

761
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,320
want to prove the optimal sequence of

762
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,200
dwcm then you require this assumption

763
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,640
that the underlying hash function should

764
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,720
be ky's regular

765
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,960
and finally one can improve the security

766
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,279
amount of 1k dw serium from

767
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,760
from 2n by 3 base to 3 by 4 bits using

768
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,039
the similar technique that we have

769
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,600
employed in this paper

770
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,399
and

771
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,679
thank you for the thank you for
