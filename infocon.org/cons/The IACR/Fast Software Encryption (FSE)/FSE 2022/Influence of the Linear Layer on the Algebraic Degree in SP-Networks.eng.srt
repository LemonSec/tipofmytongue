00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,879
hello

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,880
and greetings from the city of graz here

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,480

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,559
my name is reinhard lufthannecker and

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,800
i'm going to talk about our work

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,400
influence of the linear layer on the

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,480
algebraic degree in substitution

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,800
permutation networks

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
this is a joint work together with

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,520

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,920
back then affiliated with royal holloway

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,519

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,359
lorenzo and aldo from the hotbod

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,199
university in the netherlands

15
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,439
and kristen and marcos from our research

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,359
group here at grads university of

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,000
technology

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,200
since the

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
rest of the presentation is devoted to

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,680
the ideas of how we arrived at our

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,120
results

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,120
let me first address the point why are

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,680
results important

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,960
well

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,559
studying the algebraic degree is a

26
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,320
classical and important topic in

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
symmetric cryptanalysis because the

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,000
algebraic degree

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,840
is often one of the key data that

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,760
determines the cost of several types of

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,800
algebraic cryptanalysis

32
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,400
i'm speaking here of interpolation

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
cryptanalysis higher order differentials

34
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,840
and also equation solving over f2

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,360
the only problem is in practice we don't

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,000
know the exact algebraic degree of fully

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,640
fledged cryptographic permutations

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,280
it just quickly becomes too expensive to

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,119
evaluate the degree exactly

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,360
this is the reason why we resort to

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,119
establishing upper bounds on the

42
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,520
algebraic degree rather than trying to

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,119
evaluate it exactly

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
all right let me jump right in the

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,520
middle of things and let me state the

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,079
main result of our article

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,399
we present and prove a new upper bound

48
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,240
on the algebraic the green substitution

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,200
permutation networks

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,320
what is

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,399
special about our bound is

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,079
besides the degree of the non-linear

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,920
layer it also considers the degree of

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,520
the linear layer for its estimate on the

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,600
algebraic degree

56
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,920
and it is fair to say

57
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,320
this is something which is particularly

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,079
new in the literature because other

59
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,680
state-of-the-art bounds to not use this

60
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,560
property for the estimates

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,280
and most notably our bound is

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,560
considerably tighter than

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,319
state-of-the-art bonds in case of

64
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,959
substitution permutation networks

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,959
with low degree round functions and

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,200
largest boxes

67
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,760
on the contrary our bound may not

68
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
improve state of the outbounds for spns

69
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,239
with small s boxes or high degree round

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,720
functions

71
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,160
the thing is

72
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
recent symmetric crypto designs for

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,760
example used in zero knowledge proof

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,400
protocols often build upon spns with

75
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,640
large s boxes

76
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,840
so

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
the particular

78
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,519
relevance of our bound therefore lies in

79
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,599
this domain and

80
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,920
it may well lie with future designs in

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,480
this domain as well

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,120
and coming to the actual comparison

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,840
we

84
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
compare our bound with the bound of

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,319
christina boura and canto and christoph

86
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,599
de canier

87
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,239
which is arguably the currently best

88
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,920
theoretic upper bound on the algebraic

89
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,040
degree

90
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,920
and often gives the best theoretical

91
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,000
results in literature

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,280
i will

93
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,760
refer to this bound as the bcd bound

94
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,040
throughout this presentation

95
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,239
before i'm going to present the actual

96
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,360
results

97
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,400
let me quickly clarify our nomenclature

98
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,720
first of all we are dealing with spns or

99
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,200
f2 to the n to the t

100
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,760
see also the frame title here

101
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,200
now

102
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,040
if you want the figure in the upper left

103
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,519
half of the frame depicts one round of

104
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,879
an spn

105
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,640
and indicates that the number of words

106
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,519
in sbn is denoted by t

107
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,920
furthermore l denominates the degree of

108
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,360
the linear layer

109
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,159
and with degree here i mean the

110
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,040
word level degree

111
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,360
each s-box in the spn operates over f2

112
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,599
to the n and thus we have the following

113
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,519
two options

114
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,200
first

115
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,920
we look at an s box from the word level

116
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,959
meaning

117
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,920
seeing it is operating over f2 to the n

118
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,920
the finite field with two to the n

119
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,759
elements

120
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,959
in this case

121
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,519
the word level degree of the xbox is

122
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,400
denoted by d

123
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,080
the second option is

124
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,440
we look at an s-box from the bit level

125
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,120
in fact meaning

126
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,360
seeing it as operating

127
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,680
over the enfold cartesian product of f2

128
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,479
by doing this we say the s-box size is n

129
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,440
bits and we denote by delta the

130
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,360
algebraic degree of the s box

131
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,440
as a remark from my side

132
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,160
this different levels of representation

133
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,120
are a bit intricate so to say

134
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,759
and i will give some more motivation on

135
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,160
this point in the later slides until

136
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,360
then

137
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,680
i invite you to bear with me

138
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,320
if you'd asked me about a visualization

139
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,479
of our results in a single slide

140
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,520
i'd probably answer with this one

141
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,759
the diagram shows several bounds on the

142
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,479
algebraic degree for an spn over f2 to

143
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,360
the 33 with eight words

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,039
and with the cubing functions as box

145
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,199
function

146
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,080
now in this diagram the horizontal black

147
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,400
dashed line shows the maximum algebraic

148
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,360
degree

149
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,520
whereas the blue line shows the bcd

150
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,840
bound

151
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,120
for the other lines they depict our

152
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,199
bound on the algebraic degree

153
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,199
for various degrees of the linear layer

154
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,360
ranging from 1 to 8 here

155
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,520
maybe one particular norm of our bound

156
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,919
you can see in this diagram

157
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,400
you see there are potentially two phases

158
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,000
of algebraic degree growth a phase

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,240
of exponential growth for the first few

160
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,199
rounds

161
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,440
followed by a phase of linear growth for

162
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,919
the remaining rounds

163
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,720
now the norm of our bound is

164
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,759
it makes these two faces visible

165
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,720
you will see this also in a later slide

166
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,199
when i give a precise formulation of our

167
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,479
bound

168
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,520
on the algebraic degree

169
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,759
another important point to highlight

170
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,960
here is

171
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,120
the linear growth is all the more

172
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,880
prominent the lower the degree of the

173
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
linear layer is

174
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,199
the red line here

175
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,639
for example

176
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,639
corresponds to a linear layer with

177
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,800
degree one and exhibits the longest

178
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,039
phase of linear growth in this diagram

179
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,400
as a

180
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,479
final remark

181
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,280
you can observe a gradual shift of

182
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,080
emphasis from linear growth to

183
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,919
exponential growth

184
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,080
as the degree of the linear layer

185
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,080
increases

186
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
not only the algebraic degree per se is

187
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,400
important but also the number of rounds

188
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,319
in an sbn to reach a maximum algebraic

189
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,160
degree

190
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,720
the following table shows a comparison

191
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,800
of the minimum number of rounds to reach

192
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,520
maximum algebraic degree for various spn

193
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,680
parameters

194
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,440
the s-box function in this example is

195
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,840
again the cubing function and the linear

196
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,479
layer is just defined by ordinary matrix

197
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,240
multiplication with a

198
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,039
certain mds matrix hence the linear

199
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,080
layer has degree 1.

200
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,880
now the table compares the number of

201
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,960
rounds derived from our bound and the

202
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,800
bcd bounds

203
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,360
and in addition it shows

204
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,919
practical results for a concrete linear

205
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,160
layer given by the multiplication with

206
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,199
the mds matrix

207
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,080
the

208
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,400
important point here is

209
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,120
for a fixed state size here denoted by

210
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,360
capric capital n

211
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,479
it is reasonable to say our bound

212
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,280
becomes tighter and tighter

213
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,720
as the number of words t decreases and

214
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,240
hence the s box size n increases

215
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,479
you can see this

216
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,680
as you move down in this table

217
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,520
at the same time

218
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,919
the table shows the growing advantage of

219
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,120
our bounds

220
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,680
over the bcd bound as the s-box size

221
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,240
increases

222
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,520
so here is another table

223
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,279
showing the same comparisons as before

224
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,039
but this time for an even masseur-based

225
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,719
permutation and for various degrees of

226
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,440
the linear layer

227
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,519
in a nutshell

228
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,519
an even monsoon construction is an spn

229
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,519
with only one large world and thus only

230
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,399
one largest box

231
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
it is

232
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,120
this case where the difference between

233
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,040
our bound and the bcd bound is most

234
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,120
substantial for example

235
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,959
so maybe two point two important points

236
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,040
to remark here

237
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,080
first the comparison with the concrete

238
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,480
linear layer in the first third of the

239
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,760
table

240
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,360
namely with a dense linearized

241
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,240
polynomial of a certain degree

242
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,480
shows an exact match of the number of

243
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,240
rounds to reach maximum algebraic degree

244
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,360
predicted by by our theoretical bound

245
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,959
with the

246
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,760
number of rounds derived from practical

247
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,839
experiments

248
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,399
the second point refers to the behavior

249
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,080
we have already seen in the very first

250
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,680
diagram

251
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,880
namely as the degree of the linear layer

252
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,160
increases

253
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,480
the number of rounds

254
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,040
to reach maximum algebraic degree

255
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,680
decreases

256
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,760
this suggests that the degree of the

257
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,959
linear layer substantially influences

258
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,880
the algebraic degree growth

259
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,959
and that you can think of our bounds

260
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,119
as quantifying this influence

261
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,120
well i've promised some motivation

262
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,720
regarding the different levels of

263
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,360
representation for functions right

264
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,440
let me do this now

265
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,519
every function over a finite field can

266
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,240
be represented as a polynomial

267
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,839
what's more

268
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,920
due to the isomorphism of f2 vector

269
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,360
spaces

270
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,079
as indicated here in the frame title

271
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,279
we have different levels of

272
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,600
representation

273
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,920
for example if you consider the state of

274
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,040
an spn or f2 to the n to the t

275
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,480
from the bit level

276
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,000
then you have nt output bits

277
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,240
and each such output bit can be

278
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,480
represented as a polynomial

279
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,560
in nt variables

280
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,560
with maximum degree 1 in each variable

281
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,640
when we speak of the algebraic degree

282
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,120
then it is exactly this bit level

283
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,640
representation we refer to

284
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,839
so in more technical speech

285
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,240
this means every such output bit can be

286
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,040
represented as an element

287
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,959
within this quotient ring given here in

288
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,839
the topmost figure

289
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,160
another perspective is

290
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,079
since the s boxes in spn might be

291
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,880
naturally defined over f2 to the n

292
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,680
it is natural to

293
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,480
view those n bits as belonging together

294
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,079
hence giving you

295
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,079
t words with n bits each

296
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,399
from this point of view every such word

297
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,440
can be represented as a polynomial in t

298
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,320
variables with maximum degree 2 to the n

299
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,959
minus 1 in each variable

300
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,360
again the stated quotient ring here in

301
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,480
the

302
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,920
middle figure

303
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,399
is a more formal way to express this

304
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,079
fact

305
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,279
lastly

306
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,079
you can consider the state of an spn

307
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,399
as a single element in the large binary

308
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,680
extension field f2 to the nt

309
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,320
this perspective would then give rise to

310
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,399
a universe polynomial representation

311
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,959
with maximum degree 2 to the nt minus 1.

312
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,639
as the pct bound is often our benchmark

313
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,440
let me quickly motivate this bounds

314
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,680
first consider a function f that is

315
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,480
defined as the parallel application

316
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,000
of ts boxes each operating over f2 to

317
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,160
the n

318
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,959
then for any function g

319
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,519
the algebraic degree of g composed with

320
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,399
f

321
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,600
is upper bounded by this expression here

322
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,120
here the parameter gamma

323
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,079
is a

324
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,160
constant that depends on the details of

325
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,079
the s-box and can

326
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:50,880
in

327
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,279
theory at least be computed from the

328
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,480
specs of the s-boxes

329
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,399
as i

330
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,639
will also speak of the naive bound or

331
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,880
the naive exponential bound

332
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
compare the bcd bounds

333
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,839
with the most generic bound on the

334
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,480
compositional degree

335
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,279
this most generic bound here

336
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,279
is just given by the product of the

337
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,040
respective individual degrees

338
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,120
then

339
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
iterating this naive bound

340
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
leads to the naive exponential bound

341
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,160
because in each iteration the root the

342
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,320
respective degrees

343
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,720
just keep on multiplying thus leading to

344
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,320
an exponential bound in the end

345
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,839
of course the

346
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,600
bcd bound as stated here and as stated

347
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,839
in the original research

348
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,639
article just considers the composition

349
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,120
of two functions

350
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,760
which is why we are going to extend the

351
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,519
pc d bound as stated here to the

352
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,959
composition of more than two functions

353
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,480
let's have a look at the outcome of this

354
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,040
extension

355
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
now we are considering several

356
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
iterations of the composition of a

357
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,040
non-linear sbox layer f with arbitrary

358
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,160
fine functions mi

359
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,800
we call the resulting function e to the

360
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,839
r where r denotes the number of

361
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,480
iterations

362
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,399
now applying the bcd bound iteratively

363
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,399
to this function e to the r and

364
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,399
combining it with the naive exponential

365
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,680
bounds

366
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,600
gives us the following boundary on the

367
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,480
algebraic degree

368
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,040
for a certain number of iterations here

369
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,880
called r0

370
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,920
the naive exponential bounds will be

371
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,160
better than the bcd bound

372
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,040
see the first case

373
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,480
afterwards we obtain the bound

374
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,399
given in the second case here

375
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,079
i

376
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,320
may draw your attention to the

377
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,279
particular expression of this bound here

378
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,800
namely the fractional term here is an

379
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,519
inverse exponential expression

380
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,839
and subtracting this inverse exponential

381
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,600
expression from n

382
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,079
then describes a kind of saturation

383
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,320
process

384
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
this saturation process

385
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
is probably best illustrated with the

386
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,759
following example

387
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,600
the example considers the ketchup f

388
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,040
permutation with a state size of 1600

389
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,360
bits

390
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,720
now in the diagram the blue graph

391
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,839
depicts the naive exponential bound on

392
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,680
the algebraic degree

393
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,800
and the red graph shows the iterated bcd

394
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,199
bound as described on the previous slide

395
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,680
just to mention

396
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,959
the data for the red graph is taken from

397
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:05,759
the

398
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,079
research article by christina burram and

399
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,040
canto and christophe de kanier

400
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,079
now

401
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,279
what you can clearly see in this diagram

402
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,320
is this saturating behavior

403
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,720
of the bcd bound as the number of rounds

404
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,440
increases

405
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,880
i am

406
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,720
however a bit

407
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,639
hesitant to give an explanation of the

408
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,279
saturating behavior but

409
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,600
i suspect it stems from the particular

410
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,800
connection

411
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,279
of the algebraic degree of a permutation

412
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,040
with the degree of its

413
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,839
inverse permutation

414
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,519
an example

415
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,839
of this connection is

416
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,680
it takes as many rounds to reach maximum

417
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,160
algebraic degree in forward direction as

418
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,880
it takes in backward direction

419
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,680
the point here is

420
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,920
it could be interesting to explore this

421
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,160
connection of forward and backward

422
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,199
degree

423
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,000
because our bound

424
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,240
as it is formulated now does not

425
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,119
incorporate this link yet

426
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,480
i

427
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,199
do not exclude the possibility to

428
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,280
establish this link

429
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,160
but at least for now leave it open as

430
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,799
future work

431
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,000
before i'm going to present our bounds

432
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,679
on the algebraic degree

433
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,440
let me emphasize the polynomial

434
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,480
representation of linear functions

435
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,799
the main point here is

436
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,280
if two linear functions correspond with

437
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,080
f2 linearized polynomials

438
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,160
a linearized polynomial in this context

439
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,200
is

440
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,400
a polynomial

441
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,720
with terms only having powers of 2 is

442
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,559
exponents

443
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,440
now

444
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,200
given a

445
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,600
certain linear function l over f 2 to

446
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,799
the n

447
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,360
we can represent it as polynomial of the

448
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,880
following form

449
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
given here

450
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,919
so

451
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,559
note that the exponents here are only

452
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,360
powers of 2.

453
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,400
the

454
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,559
same holds true for linear functions

455
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,720
over f 2 to the n to the t

456
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,880
in this case we'd arrive at the

457
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,960
multivariate polynomial that is

458
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,760
linearized in each variable

459
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,919
now if we

460
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,400
translate these observations to spns

461
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
then it is exactly

462
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,640
this multivariate linearized

463
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,039
representation that defines the degree

464
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,919
of the linear layer

465
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,039
with all these observations about

466
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,039
different polynomial representations at

467
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,440
hand we are now ready to digest the

468
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,200
formulation of our new upper bound and

469
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,600
algebraic degree

470
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,160
the basic strategy of how we arrived at

471
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,679
our bound is

472
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,160
we observe the degree on two levels

473
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,760
simultaneously

474
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,440
namely the bit level and the world level

475
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,880
the connection

476
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,280
between those two levels is as follows

477
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,200
given this universe polynomial f here

478
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,880
the word level degree

479
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,440
here denoted by deck of f

480
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,799
is just the usual degree of this

481
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,440
polynomial

482
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,400
the point is there is a well-known link

483
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,320
to the bit level degree or algebraic

484
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,840
degree delta of f here

485
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,960
and this link is given by the maximum of

486
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,280
the hemingway of exponents on the word

487
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,240
level

488
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,559
and of course we're only considering

489
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,000
such exponents

490
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,840
with non-zero coefficient

491
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,640
the following example should illustrate

492
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,840
this

493
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,559
given the polynomial x to the 12 plus x

494
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,240
to the seven plus one

495
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,960
you get the following two degrees

496
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,799
the word level degree is just the

497
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,880
ordinary degree of the polynomial namely

498
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,480
12.

499
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,520
while

500
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,080
since the hemingway in this context here

501
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,640
denotes the number of non-zero binary

502
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,159
digits in the base 2 expansion

503
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,720
we can observe that the algebraic degree

504
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,559
in this example here is 3.

505
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,679
let's have a look at the actual

506
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,159
formulation of our amount

507
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,080
the basic setup is the same as what we

508
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,960
have seen for the bcd bound

509
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,720
this function f here

510
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,440
describes the parallel application of ts

511
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,520
boxes each operating over f2 to the n

512
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,320
the

513
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,000
functions mi are just arbitrary linear

514
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,080
or refined functions all having the same

515
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,240
degrees

516
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,039
again we will bound the algebraic degree

517
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,080
of e to the r which is the iterated

518
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,158
composition of f with mi

519
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,600
now

520
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
our bound on the algebraic degree of e

521
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,640
to the r states

522
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,120
the algebraic degree is upper bounded by

523
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,280
the naive exponential bounds

524
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,360
given by delta to the r

525
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,039
for a certain number of initial rounds

526
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,840
this point i mean is nothing new so far

527
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,960
it is this second expression here which

528
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,080
is the actual contribution of our bounds

529
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,360
you can see

530
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,559
this second expression here incorporates

531
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,360
the

532
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,440
word level degree of both the linear

533
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,360
functions mi

534
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,919
and the nonlinear functions f

535
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,440
and

536
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,400
thus

537
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,600
contains the respective degrees l and d

538
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,000
in its estimate

539
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,400
what's important here is

540
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,960
this second expression is

541
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,880
linear in the number of rounds and thus

542
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
describes the phase of

543
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,640
linear growth of the algebraic degree

544
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,280
i suggest let's have a closer look at

545
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,158
this linear growth

546
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,120
when we speak of the influence of the

547
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,280
linear layer on the algebraic degree

548
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,960
it's worth mentioning

549
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,720
the linear layer per se does not

550
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,360
influence the algebraic degree

551
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
even if the linear layer has a high word

552
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,880
level degree

553
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,799
after all its algebraic degree is still

554
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,520
at most one

555
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
so one way to frame this influence could

556
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,960
be

557
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,039
the linear layer helps the non-linear

558
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,559
layer to exhaust its exponential

559
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,120
potential

560
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,720
let's explicate this point with the

561
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,520
following example here

562
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
we take the cubing function represented

563
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,000
by the polynomial f

564
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,840
compose it with a linearized polynomial

565
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,039
l

566
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:40,320
and iterate this composition three times

567
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,960
as a result we arrive at e3 here

568
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,679
now l will be a dense linearized

569
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,240
polynomial of degree

570
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,679
one two and four

571
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,120
the point is as the degree of l

572
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,440
increases also the algebraic degree of

573
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,480
e3 increases

574
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,400
eventually for the case of a linearized

575
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,880
polynomial with degree 4 here in the

576
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,640
bottom line

577
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,039
the degree growth is already exponential

578
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,760
in this example

579
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,159
we come back to the diagram from the

580
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,280
very beginning of the presentation

581
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,120
with all that has been said about the

582
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,400
influence of the linear layer on the

583
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,919
algebraic degree

584
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,679
this diagram may reinforce its

585
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,000
observations

586
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,159
as observed on the previous slide

587
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,320
the degree of the linear layer helps the

588
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,640
non-linear layer to exhaust its

589
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,880
exponential potential

590
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,039
you can see this as you jump between the

591
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,200
lines from right to left

592
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,520
the diagram shows the higher the degree

593
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,520
of the linear layer is the more the

594
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,360
algebraic degree may grow exponentially

595
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,279
i deliberately say here may grow

596
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,039
exponentially because

597
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,360
of course the growth also depends on the

598
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,080
concrete structure of the linear layer

599
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,360
nevertheless

600
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,520
the point here is clear

601
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
our bound helps to quantify the

602
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,799
influence of the linear layer on the

603
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,840
algebraic degree

604
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,120
as a final remark

605
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,039
let me state some open problems and

606
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,360
directions for future work

607
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,640
first of all

608
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,480
since our bound only considers the

609
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,320
degree of the linear layer it can be

610
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,559
interesting to study how the concrete

611
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,799
structure of the linear layer influences

612
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,760
the algebraic degree growth

613
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,880
then

614
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,919
we expect that more can be said about

615
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,000
algebraic degree growth

616
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,159
if we consider partial sbms

617
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,559
and as a last work item

618
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,840
there is this connection

619
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,080
between forward degree and backward

620
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,880
degree for permutations

621
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,520
and since our bounds does not exploit

622
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,440
this connection yet it can also be

623
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,279
interesting to try to capture it

624
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,960
all right this is the end of my

625
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,559
presentation

626
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,760
i

627
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,600
appreciated the opportunity to talk

628
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,400
about our result influence of the linear

629
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,840
layer on the algebraic degree and

630
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,520
substitution permutation networks

631
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,440
thanks for your time and

632
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,120
once again greetings from the city of

633
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,440
graz in austria and looking forward to

634
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
meeting some of you at the conference in

635
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,400
athens

636
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,400
bye-bye
