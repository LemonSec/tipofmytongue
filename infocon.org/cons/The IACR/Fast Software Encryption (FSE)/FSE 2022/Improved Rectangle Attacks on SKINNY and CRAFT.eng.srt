00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,320
hi everyone

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,400
welcome to this talk my name is hussein

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,399
hadipur and i'm going to present our

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,400
paper entitled improved rectangle

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,160
attacks in skinny and craft which is

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,440
joint work with nesubari and link sign

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,839
i've divided my talk into six parts

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,840
as you can see i will start with giving

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,199
a short introduction to boomerang

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,279
sandwich extinguishers

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,000
and then i will introduce our new method

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,920
to search for sandwiches signatures for

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,760
spm like ciphers

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,240
next i will briefly review the bcd

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,440
framework and introduce our new tools in

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,000
vcd framework

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,079
then i will discuss about application of

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,239
our methods on two lightweight stream

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,920
like ciphers including aircraft and

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,840
skinny and lastly conclude the talk by

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,399
summarizing our

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,800
main contributions in this work

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,559
let's start by the first part where i'm

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,879
going to give a short introduction to

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,440
boomerang and sandwich extinguishers

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,520
given the black cipher e is black size

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,160
of n bits if we have a long differential

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,840
transition with probability smaller than

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,479
2 to the minus n we cannot exploit it to

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,240
distinguish black cipher e from a random

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,840
implementation

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,880
however

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,600
what if we can divide the block surface

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
into two smaller parts in the easier and

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,759
even such that for each of which there

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,840
exists a differential transition with a

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,000
very high probability

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,520
for example

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
in this case what if there exists

40
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,360
differential transitions

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,200
for easier and even with probability p

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,920
and q respectively such that p s square

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,680
q squared is much greater than to the

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,880
minus n

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,200
the core idea of boom rankings analysis

46
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,680
is combining these two short

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,400
differential transitions

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,159
in adaptively chosen playing text

49
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,759
circuitry setting

50
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,600
to build a distinguisher

51
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,439
for black cipher

52
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,880
in boomerang captain analysis it is

53
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,439
assumed that the attacker has access to

54
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,960
both encryption and decryption oracles

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,479
let's see how boomerang distinction work

56
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,920
in boomerang distinction we firstly

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,079
provide a pair of plain tastes

58
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,840
with different delta

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
and ask the encryption of these

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,959
pair of plain text to derive the

61
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,920
corresponding ciphertext c1 and c2

62
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,440
as you can see the differential

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,599
transitions delta 1 to delta 2 is

64
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,239
happened with relative p

65
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,400
next we apply the same difference

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
and derive the ciphertext c1 and c2 to

67
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,800
generate two new ciphertexts namely c3

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,160
and c4 and then we query the decryption

69
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,920
of c3 and c4 to derive the corresponding

70
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,319
plain text which are denoted by p3 and

71
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,440
p4

72
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,440
and then we check the difference between

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
p3 and p4 to see whether the difference

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,760
between them is delta 1

75
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,080
or not

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,319
if the differential transitions in the

77
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,640
upper part

78
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,800
are independent of the differential

79
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,760
transitions in the lower part

80
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,519
the probability of observing delta one

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,519
on the other side of this shape

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,360
is actually the multiplication of the

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,200
probability of these four differential

84
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
transitions

85
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,840
which is actually equal to ps squared qs

86
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,120
squared

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,319
however

88
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,640
the upper differential transition

89
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
in boomerang kept analysis or a

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,120
boomerang distinction

91
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
is not independent of the lower

92
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,400
differential transition in practice

93
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,319
the dependency between the upper and

94
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,120
lower differential transitions can have

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,000
either a positive or a negative effect

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,519
and the resulting

97
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,680
uh boomerang distinguisher

98
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,799
for example physical switch which was

99
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,799
firstly introduced in the seminal paper

100
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,159
of boomerang cryptanalysis by wagner or

101
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,920
leather switch and spark switches are

102
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,480
some kind of dependencies that has a

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,120
positive effect on the resulting boom

104
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,200
rank distinguisher

105
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,439
using which attacker can drive a boom

106
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,720
range distinction with a higher

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,120
probability

108
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,680
on the other side dependency between the

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,840
upper and lower differential transitions

110
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,760
can have a negative effect and for

111
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,720
example implies some kinds of

112
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,840
inconsistencies between the upper and

113
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,640
lower differential trends

114
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,599
which

115
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,799
spoil the

116
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,480
boomerang distinguisher

117
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,880
therefore considering and formalizing

118
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,639
the dependency between the offer and

119
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,000
level differential transitions in

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,519
boomerang distinguisher

121
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,320
is of great significance that's why the

122
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,840
idea of sandwich extinguisher was

123
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,759
prefers as you can see in the shape in

124
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,160
sandwich distinguisher instead of

125
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,400
dividing the black cipher into two

126
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,600
slices we divide it into three slices

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,840
including e0 em and

128
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,080
e1 where the middle slice is considered

129
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,160
to model the dependency between the

130
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,440
upper and lower differential transitions

131
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,280
in the sandwich extinguisher the

132
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,199
probability of getting delta 1 on the

133
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,639
other side is p square q square r where

134
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,360
r is computed using this formula and r

135
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,440
is actually the probability of sending

136
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,039
boomerang over the middle slice and

137
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,479
getting it back on the other side

138
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,960
given that the intermediate differences

139
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,440
in sandwich extinguishers namely delta 2

140
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,039
and noble 3

141
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,680
can take an arbitrary possible value

142
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,039
taking the clustering effect into

143
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,880
account we can estimate the probability

144
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,720
of sandwich extinguisher using this

145
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,560
formula more accurately as you can see

146
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
this formula is actually the summation

147
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,440
of this product over all of the possible

148
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,720
intermediate difference values

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,880
now i want to draw your attention to the

150
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,520
middle slice of sandwich extinguisher

151
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,560
and discuss in more detail about one of

152
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,160
the switching effects which is called

153
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,560
ladder switch and plays an important

154
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,759
role

155
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,759
in our method to search for sandwich

156
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,840
extinguishers this shape represents a

157
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,759
middle slice of sandwich extinguisher

158
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,680
and you can see that the probability of

159
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,280
boomerang switch over the middle slice

160
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,039
is computed using this formula

161
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,039
it can be seen that if

162
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,600
delta 2 which is actually the difference

163
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,880
coming from the

164
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,039
upper differential transition is zero

165
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,960
then the probability of runway switch is

166
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,840
one

167
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,199
it is also the case when noble tree

168
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,199
is equal to zero

169
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,560
as a result

170
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,400
if you compare

171
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,680
these shapes

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,360
as a result

173
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,120
you can see that

174
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,960
the probability of formula switch over

175
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,319
the middle slice

176
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,720
is highly dependent on the

177
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,199
common activist boxes between the upper

178
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,479
and lower differential transitions

179
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,520
and

180
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,600
then

181
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,400
the

182
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,960
entire probability of

183
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,120
sandwich extinguisher is

184
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,800
actually determined by the number of

185
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,240
activist boxes over e0 and even as well

186
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,000
as the common activist boxes over the

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,800
middle part more precisely in p square q

188
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,440
square r formula p is mostly determined

189
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,479
by the number of active boxes in e zero

190
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,160
q is mostly determined by the number of

191
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,039
activist boxes in e1 and r is mostly

192
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,400
determined by the number of common

193
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
activist boxes between the upper and

194
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,160
lower differential transitions in em

195
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,240
taking the swindler into account you can

196
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,319
see that the cost of active sparses over

197
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,240
the outer parts namely easier and ear

198
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
one is more than the cost of activist

199
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,720
boxes over the middle part because the

200
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,800
exponent of p and q in this formula are

201
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,800
two whereas the exponent of r is one

202
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,880
with this brief introduction

203
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,639
i'm going to introduce our new method to

204
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,560
search for sandwich distinguishers for

205
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,039
spm black ciphers

206
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,319
our method to search for sandwich

207
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,560
extinguishers can be divided into three

208
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,479
main steps the first step which is

209
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,880
actually the most important step

210
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,240
is devoted to find two appropriate upper

211
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
and lower

212
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
differential trains

213
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,400
minimizing the number of active boxes in

214
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,560
outer parts as well as the

215
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
number of common active spices in the

216
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,639
middle part i will discuss about the

217
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,199
system in monitors in the next slides

218
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,440
the second step of our method is

219
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,199
instantiating the discovered the

220
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,199
truncated trades with concrete

221
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,800
differential trade

222
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,639
and finally when we have concrete

223
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,479
differential trails in hand we can

224
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,800
compute p q and r and put them together

225
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,720
in p square q square r formula to

226
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,319
compute the entire quality of sandwich

227
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,800
distinguisher

228
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,280
let's take a look at the first step in

229
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,879
more detail

230
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,199
the aim of first step is finding

231
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,120
appropriate truncated upper and lower

232
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,240
trades

233
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,360
to do so

234
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,399
we divide the black cipher into three

235
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,000
parts including e0 em and e1

236
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,958
next

237
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,120
we include the

238
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,760
propagation of truncated differential

239
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,000
trains over the first r0 plus rm rounds

240
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,519
with an mlp problem

241
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,200
we do the same for last rm plus r1

242
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,080
rounds and include the propagation of

243
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,160
truncated differential trains over e m

244
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,320
and 1 with another milp problem

245
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
now we have two independent milp

246
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
models with independent

247
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,399
binary variables

248
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,720
next to detect the common activist boxes

249
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,920
in the middle

250
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,560
we define some additional variables such

251
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
as s here

252
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,440
and then assuming that you denote the

253
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,200
activeness of uh xbox in the upper trail

254
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,000
and l denotes the activeness of sparks

255
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,040
in lower trail we link these two

256
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,120
minp models to each other by including

257
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,000
these

258
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,240
three inequalities for each sparks in

259
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,200
the middle

260
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,880
into our minp model

261
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,440
according to the three inequalities you

262
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,000
can see that s is equal to one if and

263
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,120
only if

264
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,839
u and l are both equal to one it means

265
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,080
that s is equal to one if the

266
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,160
corresponding swatch in the middle is

267
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,640
active in both upper and lower

268
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,760
train

269
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,480
therefore using this technique we can

270
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,560
detect and characterize the common

271
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,000
activist boxes in the middle

272
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,920
taking these constraints into account

273
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,640
we also define an objective function

274
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,560
aiming at minimizing the number of

275
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,959
common activist boxes in the middle as

276
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,440
well as the number of active sparses in

277
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,000
the outer parts we also

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
assign some

279
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,160
weights to the for example active

280
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
sparses in outer parts as well as

281
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,000
accurate spaces in the middle part to

282
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,320
adjust the quality of the resulted sand

283
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,000
extinguisher

284
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
we can for example play with the weight

285
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,120
of

286
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,160
active sparks to drive different

287
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,600
moon rain distinguishers with different

288
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,440
probabilities

289
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,760
after discovering two appropriate

290
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,560
truncated upper and lower trays

291
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,000
we

292
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,760
come to the second step where we

293
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,519
instantiate the truncated trails with

294
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,640
concrete differential trains after for

295
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,240
example

296
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,640
instantiating the truncated differential

297
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,760
trails we compute pq and r and for

298
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,000
example

299
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,560
we do it by fixing the differences at

300
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,920
the input output of each single uh slice

301
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,800
in the

302
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,640
sandwich distinguisher

303
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,020
and

304
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,720
[Music]

305
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,640
next we put uh pq and pqr in

306
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,880
together in ps4q sql r formula to

307
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,680
compute the entire probability

308
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,240
it should be noted that we never use

309
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,839
differential characteristics to build

310
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,360
our distinguisher

311
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,760
we as you can see in the shape we only

312
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,640
fix the differences in four positions of

313
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,399
sandwich extinguishers which are the

314
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,480
connecting points between the three

315
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,320
slices of sandwich distinguisher

316
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,000
the probability the differential effect

317
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,240
for example over e0 and e1 which are

318
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,120
denoted by p and q can be computed using

319
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,959
the automatic methods for differential

320
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,480
cryptanalysis

321
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
however to compute the

322
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,920
property of boomerang switch over the

323
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,839
middle slice we need a new framework

324
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,240
which is actually the obesity framework

325
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,279
bcd framework provides for us

326
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,600
some new tools

327
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,800
which makes us able to

328
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,399
formulate the probability of booming

329
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,560
switch over the middle slice of sandwich

330
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,720
extinguisher this shape represents the

331
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
boomerang switch when it

332
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,959
includes only one swiss layer

333
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,720
and on the right hand side you can see

334
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,680
the four involved differences in this

335
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,200
boom right switch

336
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,440
besides the ddt

337
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,880
using which we

338
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,720
formulate the quality of differential

339
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,680
trails in simple in basic differentiated

340
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,880
analysis

341
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,040
bcd framework introduced a new table

342
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,880
which is called obesity

343
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
and it actually

344
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,279
encode the dependency between the upper

345
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,600
and lower differential transitions for

346
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,320
one sparx layer as you can see

347
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,590
however bct can only be used to

348
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,839
[Music]

349
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,360
formulate the

350
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,279
dependency

351
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,680
uh when the boomerang switch

352
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,959
includes only

353
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:09,839
one

354
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,079
xbox layer

355
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,320
to input the dependency between upper

356
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,920
and lower differential trails in

357
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,079
boomerang switch where it includes

358
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,920
multiple rounds we need some further

359
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,120
tools which are actually operability and

360
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,440
lower basicity

361
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
using this building blocks

362
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,680
obesity framework we can formulate the

363
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,040
probability of boomerang switch over the

364
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,680
middle slice of sandwich extinguishers

365
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,079
however in addition to these

366
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,120
tables

367
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,760
we also introduced a new table

368
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,120
which is called double boomerang

369
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,360
connected table

370
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,279
which is denoted by diversity in this

371
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,560
slide

372
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,160
and dbct is very useful to compactly

373
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
formulate the dependency between the

374
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,839
upper and lower differential trains

375
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,639
transitions over multiple parts multiple

376
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,839
rounds

377
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,800
we defined uh

378
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,480
different variants of diversity for

379
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,279
example dbcd left the visit to right and

380
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,920
dbct

381
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,040
now we come to the end of this

382
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,120
part and we are ready to discuss about

383
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,519
the application of our method for craft

384
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,680
craft is a lightweight to kill by cipher

385
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,639
which was introduced in fse 2019

386
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,680
and

387
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,600
this shape represents the

388
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,519
round function of craft the black sides

389
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,480
of craft is 64 bits and the 2k size of

390
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,360
craft is 128 bits

391
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,040
as you can see in this shape

392
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,959
the round function of graph applies five

393
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,760
basic operations on the internal state

394
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,360
which includes the diffusion layer as

395
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,760
well as the non-linear layer

396
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,440
the internal state can be viewed as a

397
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,880
four by four area of needles and

398
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,120
[Music]

399
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,240
uh the

400
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,800
nonlinear layer includes the

401
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,399
for example uh

402
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,320
is consistent all

403
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,480
applying the same formula spices on

404
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,639
every single level and the diffusion

405
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,440
layer includes for example some mix ores

406
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,880
between the rows

407
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,600
and for example two week addition

408
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,480
and

409
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,240
round constant addition as well as a

410
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,040
pyramid nibbles which is a permutation

411
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,880
over the position of nibbles

412
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,880
i i just skipped the description of 2k

413
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,959
schedule of graph because our

414
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,880
boomerang distinguishers are in the

415
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,760
single tweaker setting

416
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,480
this here represents our sixth round uh

417
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,720
deterministic distinction for craft

418
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,040
which is discovered by our tool and our

419
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,399
method

420
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,959
yellow square in this shape represents

421
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,399
nonzero differences

422
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,199
and green square represents any possible

423
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,199
difference which means that

424
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,120
in green square the difference can be

425
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,519
zero or non-zero due to the differential

426
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,720
cancellation over the diffusion layer

427
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,240
this shape represents the activeness

428
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,040
pattern over the office upper trail of

429
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,959
sandwich extinguisher

430
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,720
and this shape represents the activist

431
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,040
pattern over the lower trail now let's

432
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,279
put them together in one shape as you

433
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,880
can see there is not any interaction

434
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,120
or any common active sparks between the

435
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,399
upper and lower trail and as a result

436
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,320
due to the ladder switch the probability

437
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,160
of this distinguisher is one

438
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,839
this is another example which is

439
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,519
actually the seven round distinguisher

440
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,920
for craft and interestingly it can be

441
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,560
standard up to 14 rounds of craft

442
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
like this

443
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,600
now let's take a look at the middle

444
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
slice of this shape

445
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,720
to see how we formulate the probability

446
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,519
of boomerang switch over the middle part

447
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,440
if if we follow the propagation of our

448
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,959
upper and lower crossing differences

449
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,399
over the middle slice of this shape

450
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,399
we can see that the probability of only

451
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,000
switch in the middle slice can be

452
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,720
encoded using four dbcd tables as well

453
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,040
as some additional ddt

454
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,560
which is a very compact formulation of

455
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,360
a

456
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,199
probability of boomerang switch over

457
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,439
several rounds of crafts

458
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,000
this table summarizes our boomerang

459
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,839
distinguishers for craft

460
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,240
and probabilities which

461
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,839
are marked in red

462
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,160
have been experimentally verified as you

463
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,079
can see

464
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
in comparison to differentiate

465
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,839
cryptanalysis of craft the boomerang

466
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,480
distinguishers have a great advantage

467
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,559
for example let's compare our 10 round

468
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,000
boomerang distinction with the terminal

469
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,760
differential effect of craft as you can

470
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
see the policy of our turnaround behind

471
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,600
the circuit is 2 to the minus 19.83

472
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,280
whereas the probability of turnaround

473
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,880
differential effect of graph is 2 to the

474
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,200
minus 44

475
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,679
which reveals that boom rank

476
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,520
distinguishers have a great advantage

477
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,200
over the differential extinguishers for

478
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,120
reduced runs of craft

479
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,240
we also applied our method to a skinny

480
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,799
in the related tweaky setting to find

481
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,200
boomerang distinguishers a skinny is a

482
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,520
lightweight takeaway ciphers and has

483
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,640
different variants depending on the

484
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,200
black size of a skinny which can be 64

485
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,000
bits or 128 bits and depending on the

486
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,360
number of involved tweak is a skinny has

487
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,600
actually six main variants

488
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,679
this shape represents our 22 run the

489
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,400
practical sandwich extinguisher

490
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,039
which is discovered by our tool for one

491
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,320
of the variants of skinny

492
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,880
for example in this shape

493
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,799
as you can see we have included the

494
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,919
first a round uh in e0

495
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,679
we have included the last eight rounds

496
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,300
in e1 and we included the

497
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,919
[Music]

498
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,799
six middle rounds in the

499
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,200
boomerang switch or namely

500
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,880
em

501
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,480
the probability over e0

502
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,559
the probability of differential effect

503
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,919
over e0

504
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,480
is computing is computed using the for

505
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,440
example automatic tools

506
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,000
based on a mile p or sat

507
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,280
which is uh for example to the minus

508
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,480
2.41 here

509
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,200
this is also the case for a differential

510
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,919
effect over e1 it should be noted that

511
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,440
to compute the differential force over

512
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
e0 we only fix the difference here and

513
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,799
the difference here

514
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,480
and then we compute the probability of

515
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,080
boomerang switch over the sixth round

516
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,559
middle part using the obesity framework

517
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,400
which results in for example 2 to the

518
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,160
minus 2a

519
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
0.02

520
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,400
if we put these three

521
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,960
terms together in p of square p square q

522
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,480
square r formula

523
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,640
we can see that the probability

524
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,919
or the entire probability of this

525
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,679
distinguisher is 2 to the minus 38.84

526
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,919
in comparison to the probability of

527
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,200
best previous sandwiches signatures for

528
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,360
22 rounds of this variance of a skinny

529
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,840
you can see that we have significantly

530
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,439
improved the sexes probability

531
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,280
this table summarizes our results

532
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,360
regarding the boom rank distinguishes of

533
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,480
skinny

534
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,640
and again the probabilities marked in

535
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,799
red represents the probabilities that

536
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,720
have been experimentally verified as you

537
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,640
can see in all cases we not only

538
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
improved we not only significantly

539
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
improved the

540
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,280
success probability of sandwich

541
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,679
extinguisher but also we

542
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,039
improved the

543
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,200
sandwiches signatures by one or two

544
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,159
rounds in all cases

545
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,799
we also provided kirikouri attacks upon

546
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,400
our distinguishers for eschini and craft

547
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,240
the bottom of this table represents the

548
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,919
previous results and the top of this

549
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,240
table includes our results

550
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,360
as you can see in all cases

551
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,159
we could improve the

552
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,200
rectangle attacks by one or two rounds

553
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,480
or in only one cases yeah uh we could

554
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,320
improve the success probability

555
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,640
dramatically we also

556
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,039
provided a rectangle cryptanalysis for

557
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,200
craft for the first time

558
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,799
now we come to the end of the circuit

559
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,120
where i would just like to summarize our

560
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,880
main contributions

561
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,799
the main contribution of this vapor is

562
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,799
introducing a new heuristic method to

563
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,960
search for sandwich extinguishers we

564
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,039
also introduced

565
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,919
new tools in bcd framework including

566
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,240
dbct

567
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,760
and we applied

568
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,200
these uh new tools and this new method

569
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,520
to to spin black ciphers including

570
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,000
skinny and craft which was resulted in a

571
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,559
significant improvement in

572
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,799
boomerang distinguisher or rectangular

573
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,280
tags on this cipher

574
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,799
i would just like to mention that all of

575
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,080
our codes

576
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,200
to reproducing the result or

577
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,679
experimentally verifying the results are

578
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,600
publicly available in this github

579
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,840
repository thank you for your attention
