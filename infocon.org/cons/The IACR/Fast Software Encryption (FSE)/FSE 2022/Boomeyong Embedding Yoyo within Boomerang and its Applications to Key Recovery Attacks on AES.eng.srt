00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
hello everyone

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,280
today i am going to give a talk on our

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,520
paper boom young emitting yoyo within

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,040
boomerang and its application to key

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,320
recovery attacks on aes and follicles

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,080
this is a joint work with dr thimansha

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,480
and dr kotompo

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,480
so as we all know cryptics is the way of

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,680
determining the strength of

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,240
cryptosystems and in this work we have

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,840
devised a new cryptic technique

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,240
which is based on two very important

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,680
cryptancy techniques which were

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,560
introduced almost 20 years apart one is

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,599
the boomerang attack which was

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,840
introduced in 1999 and another is the yo

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,920
attack on spn cipher which was

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,480
introduced in 2017

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,160
and like boomerang attack and the yoyo

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,120
attack

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,520
the booming attack is also based on

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,399
adaptive chosen ciphertext 10 text

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,800
modeling

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,199
so first let's just discuss briefly

25
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,520
about both the women and attack so

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,600
bhuvanaganda occurs in the adaptive

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,920
chosen plaintext hypertext setting and

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,680
it is based on divide and conquer

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,160
paradigm

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,680
so the

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,080
idea behind movement attack is that

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,479
if we are not able to penetrate the

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,000
whole cipher

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,880
using the differential attack

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,759
so what we do we try to

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,920
compose two different differential

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,960
trails

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,040
and merge them and try to connect more

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,280
number of rounds

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,119
so as you can see

41
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,880
typically a cipher e

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,119
is divided into two sub-cyphers e one

43
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,880
and e zero

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,159
and

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,240
by employing the boomerang attack we are

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,119
trying to find a quartet of structures p

47
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,280
one p two p three p four which will

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,840
satisfy some properties

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,159
so for the e 0 part suppose there is a

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,479
differential with probability p

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,040
from alpha to beta and for the e 1 part

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
there is a differential from gamma to

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,840
delta

54
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,799
which occurs with probability q so over

55
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,719
the whole cipher

56
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,560
we try to find a

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,119
two pairs or a quarter structure

58
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,360
so we start with p one p two and in the

59
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,840
end we obtain p three and p four which

60
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,719
will

61
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,639
satisfy some properties and we will see

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,639
now what properties it is going to

63
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,160
satisfy

64
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
so initially we start with the pair of

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,800
plaintext p1 and p2 which has difference

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
alpha

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,520
and we encrypt them to obtain c1 and c2

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,640
next we add delta difference to both c1

69
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,879
and c2 to obtain c3 and c4

70
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,560
and we decrypt them to obtain p3 and p4

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,760
now

72
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,360
what is happening

73
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,000
in the boundary of e01 that is our main

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,120
interest

75
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,720
so as you can see

76
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,640
so over the e0

77
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,360
alpha is transmitted to beta difference

78
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,720
and over e1 delta is transited to gamma

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,000
difference

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,840
so if this is the case so here the

81
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,519
difference is gamma here the difference

82
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,840
is beta here the difference gamma

83
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,640
so

84
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,480
in that case the difference here should

85
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,319
be beta

86
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,440
and if the difference is beta here then

87
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
there is also there is a probability

88
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,360
that this difference will translate to

89
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,440
alpha difference

90
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,680
now the hypothesis is that we start with

91
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,400
a pair of plaintext p1 p2 with alpha

92
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,360
difference and we will get a

93
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,920
pair of plaintext p3p4 with the same

94
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,159
difference

95
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,440
now what is the probability of such

96
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,560
distinguishes so for this plane

97
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,040
we need to pay the probability of p and

98
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,280
for these two differentials for these

99
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,799
two plane we need to pay the probability

100
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,519
of q square and again we have to pay the

101
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,760
probability of p for this plane so in

102
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,200
total we have to pay the probability of

103
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,440
p square q square

104
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,920
now in the boomerang attack

105
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,000
it is assumed that the two trails the

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
upper and the lower trail these are

107
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
independent

108
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,799
but

109
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,879
later it has been shown that by murphy

110
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
that actually sometimes

111
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,760
these two trails are not independent

112
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,159
there is some dependency between them

113
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,640
and it has been shown that some

114
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,879
attacks have been reported but later it

115
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,799
is shown that those attacks are

116
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,400
incompatible

117
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,239
now this dependency between the upper

118
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,640
train and lower trail can be exploited

119
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,159
further

120
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,439
to mount a better attacks or to paint a

121
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,120
more number of rounds

122
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,519
and this is exploited in the form of s

123
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,680
box switch ladder switch physical switch

124
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,000
and middle round sports weeks and these

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,759
dependencies are more generalized in the

126
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,080
sandwich attack

127
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,240
so in the sandwich attack

128
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,720
in addition of e0 and u1 there is

129
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,040
another part that is the em part which

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,759
is sandwiched between u0 and e1

131
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,160
now em captures the dependency between

132
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,479
the upper trail and the lower trade and

133
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,479
for that em part

134
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,120
our probability is incurred so this the

135
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
whole probability of this framework is p

136
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,080
square q square and r

137
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,919
so in the left side the framework for

138
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,600
bengali attack is shown and on the right

139
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
side the framework for sandwich attack

140
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,479
is one

141
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,000
and as we can see in the boomerang

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,960
attack

143
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,320
e0 and e1 is only there

144
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,639
whereas in the case of sandwich attack

145
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,840
in between e0 and u1 em is sandwiched

146
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
now

147
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,400
what happens actually with the em layer

148
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,560
if we consider em as the s-box layer

149
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,160
then some important properties pops up

150
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,440
so here

151
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
this here the

152
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,039
upper trail ends and from here the lower

153
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,280
trend it starts so this is basically our

154
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,720
em layer

155
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,919
now

156
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,160
in the mem layer there are two plain

157
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,840
text so consider here these are bytes so

158
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,600
this considered this as a 8-bit s-box

159
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,960
so

160
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,600
this is the in one byte and then there

161
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,840
is this difference a is there and this

162
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,680
is the another byte

163
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
and both of these

164
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
are passes through the

165
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,960
s box layer to obtain sx and sx xor a

166
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,880
so there is some difference between them

167
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,759
and b is added to both of them to obtain

168
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,840
these two parts and then these are again

169
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,479
decrypted

170
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,240
now

171
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,479
what is the probability that x dash and

172
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,039
x double dash should be a

173
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,280
we have to find that so if this is our

174
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,759
typical boomerang framework if there is

175
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,800
no dependency so

176
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,319
the probability

177
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,360
that this s box should have

178
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
over this differential

179
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,039
that should be squared for this

180
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,800
probability however there are some

181
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,479
special cases occur when this

182
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,080
probability is much better than this

183
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,080
so now

184
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,520
first of all

185
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,160
for the case of ladder switch

186
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,560
now we want that probability a

187
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,960
but in the ladder switch the b is

188
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,400
0

189
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,039
so that essentially means that

190
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,919
this value is exactly this one and this

191
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,840
value is exactly this one

192
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,919
so in this case

193
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,400
the probability of x

194
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,520
dash

195
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,639
xor

196
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,960
equal to a is one so that means in the

197
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,319
case of ladder switch this occurs with

198
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,120
probability one

199
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,160
now in the case of xbox switch this b

200
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,120
is actually the difference between s x

201
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,919
x or s x uh xor a

202
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,880
so the difference here is exactly the

203
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,680
same

204
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
as the value of b

205
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,199
so in that case

206
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,759
this value is actually this one and this

207
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,319
value is actually this one

208
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,319
so again that means that these two

209
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,560
values are just interchanged in this

210
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,160
form from here

211
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,120
so again here

212
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,520
this a occurs deterministically under

213
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,319
the condition that this b is actually

214
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,639
this difference so again we don't need

215
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,280
to pay the probability for this plane we

216
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,639
have to pay the probability for this

217
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,960
plane

218
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,440
now we move to the second part of our

219
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,360
data so the eo attack which is again

220
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,879
occurs in the adapted chosen plaintext

221
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,120
ciphertext setting and it looks quite

222
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,840
similar to the booming attack

223
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,319
so initially we take a plain text pair

224
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,639
with alpha difference

225
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,720
we encrypt them using the round reduced

226
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,520
cipher to obtain c1 and c2 with beta

227
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,800
difference

228
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
we do some operation which is known as

229
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,680
what swap which will see later what this

230
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,720
actually what operation is this one

231
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,120
and we obtain c 1 s and c 2 s and the

232
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,520
difference between c 1 and c 2 dash is

233
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,919
exactly the same as this one so this

234
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,519
should be again beta

235
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,760
and we then decrypt them

236
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,399
to obtain p 1 dash and p 2 dash and we

237
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,559
take the difference delta between them

238
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,480
now we see that

239
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,959
nu of alpha is exactly new of delta now

240
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,720
what is this mean we have to see that

241
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,040
so first of all

242
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,360
how can we choose alpha in the previous

243
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,519
in this attack so we have to choose the

244
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,320
alpha based on some zero defense pattern

245
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,720
and these are all answered in the

246
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
second paper by rhony metal

247
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
and the round reduced sapphire is

248
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,040
actually two round generic substitution

249
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,360
permutation networks and the swap works

250
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,200
on based on the non-linear layer and

251
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,120
this new is the actually the zero

252
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,200
defense pattern

253
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,160
so ranja matal

254
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,279
reported the attack and devised the

255
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,480
deterministic

256
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,640
user for two generic substitution

257
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,519
permutation rounds

258
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,040
so

259
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,920
and they use their results to mount

260
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,519
first key independent your

261
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,240
distinguishers for aes

262
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
and they also mounted a five round

263
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,839
practical key recovery attack

264
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,200
now what is this what's operation so

265
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,920
consider these two aes states and as you

266
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,880
can see these are the states we have

267
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,440
actually grouped the diagonals the bytes

268
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,080
in the diagonals are grouped together

269
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,839
now

270
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,320
if we interchange the

271
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,560
diagonals between these two cipher text

272
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,399
this operation is known as what swap

273
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,800
operation

274
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,000
and the zero difference pattern

275
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,120
so we take two plaintext again the aes

276
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,040
state is considered here

277
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,480
so we take two

278
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,040
states we take the difference

279
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,600
and we pattern the

280
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,399
we

281
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,720
construct a pattern based on their

282
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,079
diagonals

283
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,800
so if we see this diagonal

284
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,880
the bytes here are active so

285
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,120
we consider this diagonal as the active

286
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,320
one and all other diagonals are inactive

287
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,839
so the first diagonal is active that is

288
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,200
why it is

289
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,680
that is noted denoted by 0 and as the

290
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,279
all diagonals are inactive these are

291
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,839
denoted by one and thus the weight of

292
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,760
this zero defense pattern is three

293
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,399
so the ua attack it

294
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,000
it constant new pairs of plaintiffs and

295
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,920
separate text adaptively from the

296
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,360
original pairs

297
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,240
and while making the pairs we keep

298
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,360
certain property as invariant

299
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,000
and at the end of the

300
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,240
attack at the end of the game we verify

301
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,120
that the indent property is hold on the

302
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,959
holes or not

303
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,959
so our main motivation behind dividing

304
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,880
the boom young attack is to merge the

305
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,079
yoyo attack with the boomerang one

306
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,640
so in the left side the frame for your

307
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,240
attack is on whereas in the right side

308
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,680
the framework for booming attack is

309
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,720
shown so the the ua attack is more of a

310
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,200
deterministic one and it is more related

311
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,120
to some patterns instead of actual

312
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,880
differences whereas the momentum attack

313
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,200
is a probabilistic one and is related to

314
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,480
the actual differences

315
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,320
so now

316
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,079
in the context of moving attack we need

317
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,120
to revisit the watts of operation again

318
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,079
so in the

319
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,440
earlier

320
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,120
we see the whatsapp

321
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,560
operation as the

322
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
swap of some words based on some

323
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,279
diagonals or inverse diagonals

324
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,079
now

325
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,880
we can see it in some other ways also

326
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
so here we divide the cipher text into

327
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,120
two parts

328
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
the part that's not required to be

329
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,560
swapped and the parts that are not

330
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,399
required to be swapped so the parts that

331
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,760
will be swapped

332
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,880
are

333
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,760
subscripted by omega s and the parts

334
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,279
that are not to be swapped are

335
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,120
subscripted by omega l

336
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,240
and

337
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,560
the and these parts the parts

338
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,880
subscripted by omega s are interchanged

339
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,040
between the two cipher text and in this

340
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,320
way the new cipher text are created

341
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,800
and the difference between them is beta

342
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,600
omega s and beta omega l

343
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,839
so this operation can be visualized as

344
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,160
adding the difference beta omega s to

345
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,959
this cipher text to these parts to the

346
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,680
parts that are needed to be

347
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,519
interchanged

348
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,800
whereas

349
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,959
the part beta omega l

350
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,839
it is not added to this part instead 0

351
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,440
is added to this part

352
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,000
so basically we can consider this as a

353
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,079
combination of xbox switch and ladder

354
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,480
switch so this parts

355
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,560
we we we

356
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,120
apply here the xbox switch operation

357
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,600
and in this way we just interchange the

358
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,240
values here and for this part we apply

359
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
here the ladder switch operation and in

360
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,519
this way these parts remain the same and

361
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,959
in this way

362
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,440
we create the new pairs of ciphertexts

363
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,680
so in this way we can actually visualize

364
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,279
the whatsapp operation as a combination

365
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,959
of ladder switch and s box switch

366
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
now um this is shown the difference

367
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,440
between the two words and not the

368
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,560
difference the similarity between the

369
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,000
two words whatsapp pressure is shown

370
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,680
here in this figure so this is the

371
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,000
typical whatsapp operation and here the

372
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,760
whatsapp operation is shown as a

373
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,920
combination of s box switch and ladder

374
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,839
switch and these two are essentially the

375
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,839
same

376
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,240
now

377
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,440
we

378
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,120
in addition to the what's operation and

379
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,399
the yo part over in the upper upper part

380
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,880
of the trail in the lower part we try to

381
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
add the

382
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,360
booming kind of strategy so we start

383
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,920
from alpha difference with

384
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,839
the two pairs of with the pairs of plain

385
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,519
text p1 p2

386
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,480
and we reach here with probability p

387
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,720
and from here for the lower part we add

388
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,560
here the delta difference

389
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,880
and somehow if we are able to do here

390
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,279
the whatsapp operation so we add here

391
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,600
such delta differences such that some

392
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,920
whatsapp operations occurs here

393
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,800
so in that case we know that this part

394
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,079
will satisfy the yoyo game and thus this

395
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,480
will occur with probability 1 the alpha

396
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,760
dash and the nu of alpha will be equals

397
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,720
to nu of alpha test

398
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,040
so in this case we have to pay the

399
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,360
probability for this part we have to pay

400
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,040
the property of p and for this true

401
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,480
trust we have to pay the probability of

402
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,560
q square and for and this will occur

403
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,920
deterministically

404
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,320
so this firm works

405
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,920
increase the probability

406
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,000
to p square q uh p q square instead of p

407
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,399
square k square

408
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,000
so it is shown here as p square cube

409
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,560
this is wrong

410
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,199
now the booming attack now the technique

411
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,120
the framework that we have developed is

412
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,759
we applied it on five round aes six

413
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,800
round aes and ten not full cost so first

414
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,560
we we have devised a distinguishing

415
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,519
attack

416
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,839
and then we have uh extend the attack to

417
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,839
mount key recovery attack

418
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,079
and then we have mounted key recovery at

419
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,759
around six round aes and quite similar

420
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,839
to the attack on aes we have mount uh

421
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,199
key recovery attack on 10 round

422
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,680
followers

423
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,680
so first of all for the distinguishing

424
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,920
atom find out aes we have to first

425
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,480
identify the upper trail so this is our

426
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,040
upper trail in the uh attack for five

427
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,399
round es

428
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,720
so as we can see there are six bytes

429
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,560
these are free

430
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,720
and these bytes is we have marked it as

431
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,800
red uh so this is a special byte we'll

432
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,120
see where in the later case why this a

433
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,480
special one

434
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,880
and all these bytes are active bytes now

435
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,240
this

436
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,320
this value occurs with 40 to the minus

437
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,160
48 and as shown here there are four

438
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,600
four instances of such occurrences so

439
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,320
this is one such case and there are four

440
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,920
three other cases

441
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,360
so in total

442
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,560
ah if any of this occurs uh our

443
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,920
opportunity

444
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,240
and this is the sufficient condition for

445
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,160
offerings of the upper trend

446
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,560
so the cumulative probability of of all

447
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,440
this is 2 to the minus 46

448
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,399
now we need to devise the lower trend

449
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,279
so consider here to cipher text

450
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,759
okay so how we are actually constructing

451
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,199
the delta so for the lower part we this

452
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,079
is our lower trend so we have included

453
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,920
the mixed column operation and the last

454
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,839
round

455
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,720
now

456
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,799
how this delta difference is created so

457
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,599
as you can see so only the this inverse

458
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,000
diagonal is active here other values are

459
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,160
zero and how this inverse diagonal is

460
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,799
created this this value

461
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,679
sorry sorry

462
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,439
this value is actually the difference

463
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,079
between these two values in similar way

464
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,679
this value is the difference of this

465
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,440
value and this value

466
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,120
so in this way the delta is created

467
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,480
now

468
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,880
we add this delta to c1

469
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,600
to obtain c3 and this delta is added to

470
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,559
c2 to obtain c4 now when this delta will

471
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,160
be added to c1

472
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,600
this will be the

473
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,240
new cipher text so as you can see these

474
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,320
are actually the

475
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,880
this part of this cipher text and this

476
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,280
value comes from this

477
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,720
this cipher text

478
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,320
so essentially this means that we are

479
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,480
actually interchanging the inverse

480
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,679
diagonal

481
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,919
of this two plain text of this two

482
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,760
cipher text

483
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,559
and what effect does the e1 layer have

484
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,840
so

485
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,240
uh over the u1 layer if we are

486
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,000
this four bytes are actually only

487
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
dependent of this four wires so if we

488
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,400
are changing this four bytes

489
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,000
this essentially means that we are only

490
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
changing this four bytes in the internal

491
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,520
round

492
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,960
so this is our uh

493
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,640
framework for realizing the whatsapp

494
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,200
operation in the middle so as we can as

495
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,679
we have seen in the last slide we are

496
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,600
interchanging only this inverse diagonal

497
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,760
so this essentially means that in the

498
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,600
internal round we are

499
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,280
interchanging only

500
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,320
the last column of this two internal

501
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,400
states

502
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,440
now

503
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,679
the case that we have considered

504
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,039
that this six bytes will be

505
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,520
inactive in the difference so if these

506
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,919
are the two states these two by this six

507
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,080
bytes will be act uh will be

508
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,840
equal

509
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,559
now that means that if we are changing

510
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,640
this two columns that means that

511
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,679
this

512
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,799
two

513
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,520
these two bytes will only be changed

514
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,480
because these are actually same values

515
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,400
so it will have no effect on the

516
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,320
difference so that means that only these

517
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,799
two values will be changed and this

518
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,480
means that

519
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,960
these two diagonals inverse diagonals

520
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,400
are changed

521
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,640
that is very important case for our

522
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,880
attack

523
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,000
so when these six bytes are equal

524
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,760
at that time the columns of each

525
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,240
essentially means that it is equal

526
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,320
equivalent to the inverse diagonal swap

527
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
and this is uh result is actually real

528
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,520
point three and five and theorem six in

529
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,799
from the paper

530
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,120
by birthday non-john and from secret

531
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,840
2019

532
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,480
so this is the distinguishing attack on

533
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,039
500 yes so this is our upper trend so we

534
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,880
start with such alpha

535
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,600
and we expect such beta occurs in the

536
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,960
middle with probability to the minus 46

537
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,760
and from the lower part we give here

538
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,200
such delta

539
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,320
and if this is the case has occurred in

540
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,600
the middle then this case occurs with

541
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,679
probability 1

542
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,360
and at that time the values will be

543
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,480
interchanged

544
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,240
that means the whatsapp will occur in

545
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,360
the middle

546
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,640
and thus will get the

547
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,400
same pattern

548
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,640
and same zero defense patterns as alpha

549
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,120
in the written plain text pairs

550
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,320
so essentially we start we take uh 2023

551
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,440
plain text um a structure of 2023 plain

552
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,559
text we query to the encryption oracle

553
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,520
with using the all plain text we swap

554
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,600
diagonals between two cipher text and

555
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,400
then we query in the description

556
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,720
using the new cipher text and we check

557
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,200
whether the zero difference pattern for

558
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,320
the new plaintext are equal to the

559
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,480
ah zero difference pattern of alpha or

560
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,840
not

561
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,320
if this is the case then we distinguish

562
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,440
it as a

563
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,240
five round aes

564
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
now we extend the distinguishing attack

565
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,039
or find around aes to a key recovery one

566
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,080
so we take only the last part of the

567
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
attack the last round of the attack so

568
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,640
we guess here the key whites

569
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,000
and we see

570
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
we try to see so on the right pair is

571
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,080
obtained we know that

572
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,559
for the right player here only one white

573
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,720
will be active

574
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
now we guess the key for

575
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,320
this last column

576
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,880
and we check whether this difference

577
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,760
transists to this kind of difference or

578
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,640
not if this is the case we we identify

579
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,520
this as the right key candidate

580
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,159
and we repeat this process for all the

581
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,320
four diagonals here and for all four

582
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,080
columns here and in this way we

583
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,080
recover the key for the five round aes

584
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,559
now the attack on five round aes is

585
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,559
further extended to

586
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,760
convert it into a six round

587
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,600
attack on aes

588
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,679
and in this attack

589
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,400
we

590
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,600
we prepared a round in the beginning

591
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,240
so we choose pairs of plain text

592
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,400
with such kind of differences

593
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,120
and with probability to the minus 22

594
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,679
this difference will transist to this

595
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,360
kind of difference with only where only

596
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,520
one white will be active so here it

597
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,400
means that only one diagonal

598
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,559
is active that means one supers box is

599
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,559
active here

600
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,280
now so in the case uh if we consider

601
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,640
here the zero difference pattern its

602
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,320
pattern should be zero one one one

603
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,080
now if the boom young if the final

604
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,240
ground women attack from here occurs

605
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,679
successfully here

606
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,840
so we expect here this kind of

607
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,640
differences so this supers box will only

608
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,240
be active here

609
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,360
now

610
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,080
if all the bytes are active here then

611
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,760
this full state will be active and we

612
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,400
will not be able to distinguish some

613
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,720
will not be able to retrieve any school

614
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,840
information from here but if

615
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,559
this if any of the one byte is inactive

616
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,880
here then this state and this pair of

617
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,120
state will be useful for us and this

618
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,400
occurs with probability to the minus 6.4

619
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,159
and when this occurs

620
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,840
here

621
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,440
the four bytes will be active in the

622
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,039
output states

623
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,400
so

624
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,799
the bytes will be actually be

625
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,559
related to each other this should be a

626
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,280
part of a diagonal so it can be this

627
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,880
diagonal it can be this diagonal it can

628
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,279
be this diagonal it essentially will not

629
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,720
be this diagonal

630
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,440
otherwise we will not be able to

631
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,840
record the

632
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,600
key it will be very problematic for

633
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,679
recovering the key if this diagonal is

634
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,480
inactive so the inactive diagonal should

635
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,320
essentially be

636
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,240
the diagonal which is not this one

637
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,880
now here we

638
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,960
retrieve such kind of pairs

639
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,400
but uh as you can see this um

640
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,240
the the pairs which

641
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,400
which will conform to this

642
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,440
property

643
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,080
will be such kind of pairs but apart

644
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,480
from that there can also be random pairs

645
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,200
so we'll obtain a pool of right players

646
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,559
and wrong pairs

647
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,120
and the right pairs

648
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,200
will suggest the right key candidates

649
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,640
whereas wrong pairs will suggest the

650
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,919
wrong key changes and the right key

651
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,440
candidates

652
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,159
now we have no way to

653
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,520
distinguish the right key candidates

654
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,600
from the wrong key candidates and for

655
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,919
that purpose we have used the notion of

656
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,279
single null to noise ratio

657
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,159
so what we do here we take this

658
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,080
difference here

659
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,760
and

660
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,080
we guess the right key and we guess the

661
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,520
key candidate here and we see whether

662
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,880
the four to one transition occurs or not

663
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,559
and we also

664
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,480
do the same thing for the

665
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,960
return plain text pairs and see whether

666
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,279
for two one transition occurs or not and

667
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,279
if if in the both sides such kind of

668
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,120
transition has occurred we

669
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,279
we consider it as the

670
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,840
candidate and key candidate

671
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,559
and for each key candidate case so for

672
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,880
if we are guessing for this diagonal so

673
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,760
there will be 2 to 32 key cases

674
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,799
so

675
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,840
so if if a can if a candidate gets is

676
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,880
considered

677
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,279
if a candidate guess

678
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,679
if a key candidate for a key candidate

679
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,840
if both this kind of differential occurs

680
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,799
here

681
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,679
we

682
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,679
increment the counter value for this

683
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,039
key candidate

684
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,919
and in this way uh 2 to the 32 candy

685
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,000
counter value for the 2 to 32 key

686
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,400
candidates are maintained

687
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,120
so

688
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,559
we expect

689
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,480
for the right pair the right

690
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
the counter for the right

691
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,960
pair

692
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,000
will be

693
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,320
among the top values

694
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,360
and we found out that using the notion

695
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,840
of signal to noise ratio to

696
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,559
detect the right key candidate almost

697
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,158
10 right players are required here

698
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,559
next we mount the attack on 10 non

699
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,679
falcos

700
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,919
so follow cos is the aes based tweakable

701
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,720
block cipher and its design strategy is

702
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,480
quite similar to the ask

703
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,880
is based permutation ask

704
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,600
and uh in this attack uh we have

705
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,120
considered the 512 bit focus state and

706
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,799
the 512 bit fault system can be

707
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,799
considered as four parallel aes

708
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,880
substrates which goes through two rounds

709
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,360
of aes operations and after two rounds

710
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,360
of aes operation its columnized

711
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,520
permutations between the

712
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,480
different substrates are operated

713
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,840
and

714
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,440
the 500 will be aes has 20 rounds and we

715
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,080
have mount the attack on focus and which

716
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,360
is quite similar to the attack on the

717
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,880
six round aes

718
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,720
and using the attack we have been able

719
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
to uh do

720
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,960
we have able to mount a 10 round attack

721
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,720
on this cipher

722
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,840
and

723
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
again here we have used the notion of

724
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,480
signal to noise ratio

725
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,760
so these are the attacks that have been

726
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,159
reported in this uh work so the five

727
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,480
round attack on aea 600 attack on es and

728
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,399
10 node data from the follow-up cipher

729
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,360
so finally

730
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,919
the computing remarks here so

731
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,840
in this work we have devised the generic

732
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
strategy which has embedded the yo

733
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,159
within the boomerang and we have shown

734
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,320
the way of

735
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
visualizing the whatsapp operation as a

736
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,080
combination of the xbox switch and the

737
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,240
ladder switch and our techniques have

738
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,399
successfully mounted attacks on five

739
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,240
round and six round aes and 10 round

740
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,520
focus

741
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,799
and we have verified the attacks on aes

742
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,520
by implementing them on the mini version

743
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,320
of aes that is the 64-bit aes

744
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,520
and we expect that our attacks provides

745
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,679
a better understanding of aes and aes

746
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,840
like surfers

747
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,080
and there is a small query in them so in

748
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,880
our paper uh we have missed

749
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,240
missed to cite our lemma 1 and lemma 2.

750
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,559
so you know paper the lemon 1 and lemma

751
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,320
2 are actually the special case of

752
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,480
theorem five and theoretical six of this

753
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,279
paper the exchange attack paper by

754
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,799
sandra ranjom and

755
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,000
birthday

756
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
uh which was published in essec 2019

757
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,360
finally thank you
