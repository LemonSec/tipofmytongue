00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,240
my name is song ray

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,040
my presentation is towards key recovery

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,600
attack friendly distinguishers

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,160
it's application to gift one to it

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,080
it's madonna work with dongxia young

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,320
cheng phong

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,320
legion

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,600
my presentation contains four parts the

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,680
first one we talk about the background

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,480
and our motivation to write this paper

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,039
the second is our strategy for searching

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,920
differential or linear distinguishers

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,160
then we talk about

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,320
the differential craft analysis result

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,520
of gift one heat then we give the

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,480
linear crypto analysis result of gift

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,600
one to eat gift cofp and a sunday gift

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,879
because the first part

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,920
differential craft analysis is proposed

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,399
by biham and shamir in

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,600
crypto

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,120
1990

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,640
it

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,840
evaluates the security of a cipher

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,920
by its different

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,000
propagation property

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,080
and in this method

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,720
it often uses differential tools as a

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,960
distinguisher

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,759
linear crypto analysis is proposed by

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,000
machu in eurocrypt

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,119
in 1993.

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,000
it

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,960
in value is a separate separated

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,960
by the linear approximation property

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,680
in this method it's using linear hole or

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,840
linear trails as a distinguisher

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,600
on the during a differential or linear

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,559
attack procedure

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,960
it contains

41
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,920
four steps

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,200
the first

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,320
from the

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,119
arrow distinguisher with its inputs

45
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,000
denoted by alpha and this output value

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,399
denoted by beta with

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,759
probability

48
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,439
p

49
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,360
the second

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,560
extend the wrong functions at the top

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,319
from other and bottom from beta

52
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,239
third check the involved key bits in the

53
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,080
extended runs

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,959
last collect enough messages and use

55
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,440
statistical methods finding the red key

56
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,879
value

57
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,920
so

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,640
in this procedure the first and the real

59
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,120
step is to search out some valid

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,920
distinguishes

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,480
the two steps

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,720
first searching distribution

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,879
second attack procedure

64
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,959
are usually regarded as two is

65
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,319
independent

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,799
steps

67
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,120
so

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,440
when we mount an attack

69
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,319
we usually have two expectations the

70
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,160
first is the long it means that the

71
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,959
procedure should cover more and more run

72
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,480
functions

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,800
it also means that more wrong functions

74
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,640
should be extended as top and the bottom

75
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,120
of a distinguisher the second is a low

76
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,360
complexity

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,720
and it is very related with

78
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,280
the involved key bits number in the

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,040
extended wrong thing

80
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,920
run function so the number should be

81
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,559
very small

82
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,400
and we find that both expectations are

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,360
decided by the distinguished input and

84
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,840
the output

85
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,360
some distinguishers are advantageous

86
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,519
when utilized to monitor recovery

87
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,000
attacks it means that if we have two

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,959
distinguishers it covers the same wrong

89
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,599
function but

90
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,720
one

91
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,959
can be extended the uh

92
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,760
four rounds at the top the other one is

93
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,159
only can be extended by one round we

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,360
mean

95
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,319
the first one is unwanted

96
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,640
so

97
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,799
we want to find which values of alpha

98
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,200
and beta can satisfy

99
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,840
the two

100
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,920
expenditures two expectations once a

101
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,320
distinguisher with this input and

102
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,639
multiple values is formed then we can

103
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,840
mount an efficient attack

104
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,320
it means cover morons

105
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,360
with lower complexity

106
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,479
and we also noticed that a work on git

107
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,440
bandwidth by van lingual it gives the

108
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,759
longest differential distinguisher of

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,320
gifted one to it that it covered 21

110
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,560
rounds but

111
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,160
it cannot be directly used to attack

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,680
more wrong functions

113
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,600
so in their people they use its first 20

114
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,120
run the differential trail as a

115
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,440
distinguisher to attack

116
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,160
the 26th round version will give the one

117
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
to eat

118
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,639
then we give a very simple introduction

119
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,320
of gift monday

120
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,880
it is proposed by bannik

121
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,440
at the chest 2017.

122
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,960
his key says is 128 bit with the same

123
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,360
set state

124
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,039
it employs a spin structure with 40

125
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,199
rounds and a gift is also among the most

126
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,320
competitive that with the boxes suffers

127
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,720
the wrong function contains

128
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,440
three operations the first one

129
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,320
it applies

130
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,479
32 4 bit has voices to every nibble and

131
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,800
the perm base operation is very simple

132
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,520
linear bit permutation operation

133
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,120
and add one key

134
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,919
it's key shadow is also very simple

135
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,199
with master key set at

136
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,000
128 the round key size is

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,600
64 and the case that is updated by

138
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,080
blurry

139
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,120
combination of very simple operation for

140
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,080
example the rotation

141
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,039
the second part is our strategy for

142
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,880
searching differential and the linear

143
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,840
distinguishing

144
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,039
it is a two-step process

145
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,560
the first step

146
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,520
we specify the input and output values

147
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,000
inside called the initial side

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,360
and the values in the sides satisfied as

149
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,880
above two expectations the first

150
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,440
morons can be extended from the input

151
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,080
and output values then the amount of

152
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,960
involved key bits in the extended rom is

153
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,160
small second step research for

154
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,960
advantages distinguished with input and

155
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,280
output values showing only from the

156
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,039
initial set

157
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,520
gaming in the first step

158
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,160
and we first introduce the process of

159
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,319
searching for differential shields

160
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,680
for the first step we use the mrrp

161
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,080
technical to search for the initial site

162
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,280
and here are the two reasons why we do

163
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,120
with mrp

164
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,080
first

165
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,400
searching base of this step is very

166
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,759
small

167
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,680
and when compared with the length of the

168
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,080
distinguisher the number of extended

169
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
loans

170
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,759
is very very small

171
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,240
and the second is mrp technically

172
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,319
sessions and efficient

173
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,599
then we talk how to kinks

174
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,520
how to construct the imrp model

175
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,120
and the in

176
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,560
during an attack that's this activities

177
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,800
method but not the difference

178
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,039
value for example

179
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,160
for

180
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,759
xbox with input difference value zero

181
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,520
zero zero one

182
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,720
eight

183
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,840
output difference can be

184
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,599
eight values

185
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,160
so we mark all four all four bits as

186
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,599
answered bins

187
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,560
at

188
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,960
every bit in these eight out for

189
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
difference values

190
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,400
can be both

191
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,440
zero

192
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,720
or one

193
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,479
then we use zero to denote inactive b's

194
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,960
and they use one to denote active or

195
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,840
answered means

196
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,279
and the constraints of the activities of

197
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,320
the xbox's import and output

198
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,320
we notice that the four output beast one

199
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,159
as long as

200
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,519
the input

201
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,000
has at least one active bit

202
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,800
we use eight boolean variables

203
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,439
denoting is input and output difference

204
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,080
then the root of each output bit can be

205
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,160
constrained by the following five

206
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,680
inequalities

207
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,959
and

208
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,000
20

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,839
in total for each xbox

210
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,959
and then we talk how to describe the

211
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,000
inner layer we use

212
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
128 volume variable describing the

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,959
activities of the input state of each

214
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,959
extended round

215
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,959
and also as from bit is a linear

216
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,680
operation no abstract variables are

217
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,519
needed to describe it then we construct

218
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,959
inequalities

219
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,200
describing all relations between the

220
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,959
states in two consecutive runs

221
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,279
and here is the other constraints

222
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,760
first we extended at the bottom of a

223
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,519
differential

224
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,519
its output difference denoted by s0

225
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,399
should have at least one active bit

226
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,040
and the output difference of the last

227
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,240
extended round noted by sr should have

228
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,519
at least one inactive beat and these two

229
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,360
constraints can be

230
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,200
described with the following two

231
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,839
inequalities

232
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,640
then

233
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,079
till now we can construct the mrp model

234
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,640
describing the space activities in the

235
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,959
added r1 at the bottom of the

236
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,480
distribution

237
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,600
we saw the mrp model with

238
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,160
r equals to one if the arrow on the

239
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,640
model is feasible we construct the a

240
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,320
plus one wrong

241
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,519
module and see whether it is feasible

242
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,680
finally we find the largest around the

243
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,160
physical model is the number of runs can

244
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,120
be extended at the bottom

245
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,200
and the objective function can be

246
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,600
optional

247
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,320
and the mrp model describing the wrongs

248
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,880
extending at the bot at the top is the

249
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,200
similar process except that when

250
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,760
extending backward at the top of a

251
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,079
distinguisher the number of activities

252
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,959
in the last added round should

253
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,839
be less than 128 to avoid a focal

254
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,959
cold book attack

255
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,480
then

256
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,959
after we did me how many rooms can be

257
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,839
extended we are adding the involved key

258
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,920
bits we use

259
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,519
64 volume variables denote

260
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,399
the run key

261
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,440
and

262
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,399
its

263
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,519
value is zero if

264
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,320
a

265
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,200
round key bit is not involved and we set

266
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,760
it as one if it is involved

267
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,440
and also if

268
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,320
a

269
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
run key bit is

270
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,880
as running with

271
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,920
xg before the sub cell operation

272
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,680
we set it as 0 and

273
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,560
set it as 1 otherwise

274
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,639
and also the constraint can be described

275
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,760
by the following equal inequality

276
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,920
and the two one k bits share a similar

277
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,279
level if they are derived from a small

278
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,320
it the object foundation

279
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,560
is about the number of involved key bits

280
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,480
it should be

281
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,920
as small as

282
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,920
possible

283
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,560
finally we get the initial side

284
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,920
using the above model we collect all

285
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,320
values that can be extended by most

286
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,120
rounds with small amount of involved kb

287
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,720
intercept called initial set

288
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,880
and once the differential with this

289
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,519
input and output values is found we can

290
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,959
want an efficient attack

291
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
the second step

292
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,720
and during the second step

293
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,680
uh it can be described as a revisit on

294
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,519
the trees branching the bond or

295
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,000
algorithm

296
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,600
and this feature is that the algorithm

297
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,639
guarantees to return all best pairs

298
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,839
for

299
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,040
some specific initial value

300
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,639
which is very suitable for this step

301
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,480
and also we have some dedicated setting

302
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,120
first we only choose initial values from

303
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,360
the inner center of course and the

304
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,440
second is set the upper bound now active

305
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,920
as voices in each one function to be

306
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,880
four

307
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,000
and third we said the lower bound of the

308
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,079
probability of valid differential

309
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,680
uh

310
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,279
is

311
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,959
to be

312
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,719
two two minus one to eight

313
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,600
and here is our

314
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,800
matrix branch and the bond algorithm

315
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,360
first is the

316
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,320
initialization and the second is the

317
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,199
rectum research and finally we record

318
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,639
our qualified result

319
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,040
and we're searching for linear fields we

320
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,560
use

321
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,040
everything instead of ddt to describe

322
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,199
the linear mask propagation through the

323
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,839
sub cell operation

324
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,920
but the inequalities describing the

325
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,199
constraints is the same as the ddt

326
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,839
and also due to the fact that the

327
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,639
interplay of the x-box in a linear layer

328
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,680
uh in gift one v it is very crafted to

329
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,720
resist

330
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,040
in neocraft analysis

331
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,920
we cannot circle the long linear field

332
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,880
when t is less or equal to four so we

333
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,240
set it as five

334
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,720
then we give the differential correct

335
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,079
analysis

336
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,760
of uh give twenty eight

337
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,880
uh during the first step we find that

338
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,720
at the most the four rounds can be

339
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,920
extended at the top of the input value

340
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,720
and

341
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,519
at most three round functions can be

342
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,560
added at the bottom of a distinguished

343
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,120
and for the best solutions

344
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,480
uh

345
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,120
62 kb

346
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,480
kb is involved and but

347
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,399
but with this number of

348
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,839
involved kbs

349
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,880
we we cannot find the valid distance

350
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,360
measures

351
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,759
and the second best solution is

352
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,720
we involved keep b's number is

353
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,320
18 and with this number of involved kbs

354
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,560
we can find valid the distinguisher

355
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,480
and here is

356
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,680
it

357
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,279
201 differentials with probability of 2

358
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,600
minus 1 2 1

359
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,639
dot e3

360
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,680
and here is

361
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,880
two 21 different trails with probability

362
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,519
of two to minus

363
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,160
to 4.

364
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,480
finally we mount a

365
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,560
27-round attack differential attack on

366
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,480
gift one to eight with the differential

367
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,639
it's in for difference and multiple

368
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,160
difference is that

369
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,040
shown

370
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,680
in this slide we add four on that at the

371
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,759
top and then the three rounds at the

372
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,279
bottom

373
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,759
an attack is 27

374
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,120
version

375
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,160
its data complexity is uh

376
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
two two one two four

377
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,199
dot

378
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,040
s3 and the temp complexity is 21 to

379
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,480
three dot

380
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,120
five three another memory capacity is

381
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,040
the two to

382
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,440
eight zero bit to store the value of

383
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,399
involved key bits

384
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,160
and

385
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,679
in this slide it shows

386
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,359
the state of

387
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,399
for added run functions at the top

388
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,119
and in the in this lab

389
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,000
it shows the details of the

390
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,599
activities of the

391
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,199
state during the three added around the

392
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,679
bottom

393
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,160
and here is the details of the cubies

394
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,120
involved

395
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,039
during the attack procedure

396
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,160
the last we give our indian craft unless

397
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,000
it's result of gift

398
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
1 to 8. and they give the serial b and a

399
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,720
sony gift

400
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,120
and also for the first step we find the

401
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,559
four extended rounds can

402
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,280
can be added at the top and the three

403
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,200
rounds can be added

404
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,799
added at the most

405
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,480
at the bottom

406
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,880
and for the best solutions

407
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,200
uh

408
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,559
56-bit keyboards are involved but

409
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,280
no valid distinguisher therefore not

410
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,679
finally we find the valid distinguished

411
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,559
with 76

412
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,559
kb

413
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,559
and here is the its

414
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,039
15 one linear holes i would give one to

415
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,280
it

416
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,480
and

417
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,120
this is this these are two seventeen

418
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,200
wrong linear triangles with probability

419
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,320
of

420
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,439
two to minus 118

421
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,039
finally

422
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,799
we mounted

423
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,120
a 22 round linear attack

424
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,320
its

425
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,440
complexity is decided by

426
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,679
involve the kbs numbers and

427
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,919
compress the counter

428
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,679
and find that

429
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,000
user origin of

430
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
15

431
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,520
running in the hall we cannot

432
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
mount

433
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,360
attack its

434
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,840
22 version by adding four ones and the

435
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,600
three wrong that is the top and the

436
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,520
bottom so

437
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,679
we

438
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,200
we

439
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,960
we use our 15 run linear hall

440
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,000
to uh derive a seventeen running home

441
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
with probability of

442
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,840
two to minus

443
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,959
one hundred and fifteen

444
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,960
and finally the

445
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,440
17 running in the hole is as shown in

446
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,720
the slab with input mask now output mask

447
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,280
is probability is two to

448
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,000
one five minus two to minus 115

449
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,320
we add three rounds at the top and add

450
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,480
two rounds at the bottom

451
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,840
to attack his 22 round version its time

452
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,600
complexity is 2 to 117

453
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,760
state complexity is 2 to 170

454
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,480
and the memory capacity is

455
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,400
2 to 78

456
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,480
bit to implement the counters

457
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,200
and in this slide we showed the details

458
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,200
of the activities of the step

459
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,640
in the

460
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,679
three run function that is the

461
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,840
top

462
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,600
and in this lab

463
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,720
we show the details of what activities

464
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
during the

465
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,200
two extended run function at the bottom

466
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,240
and here is the cables involved in the

467
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,039
linear attack

468
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,960
and it will also

469
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,000
cover analyzes the security of gift cofb

470
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
against the linear crypto analysis

471
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,480
and it's forgive the cofb it's

472
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,360
it has a bursty bond

473
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,960
and the added security claim it so its

474
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,840
data complexity should be less than 2 to

475
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,039
34

476
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,600
and also

477
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,960
in the input or ek

478
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,919
showing

479
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,480
in this equality

480
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,720
l is unknown so

481
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,080
no active mask piece

482
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,880
in the most significant half of the

483
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,559
input

484
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,360
finally we attack

485
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,880
it with the

486
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,760
neuronal line hole with its input mask

487
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,600
and output mask as shown in the slide

488
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,280
the attack is

489
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,159
15 round version with three extended

490
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,480
rounds both on the top and the bottom

491
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,840
its data complexity is 2

492
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,320
and its temp complexity

493
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,720
is 2 to

494
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,880
90.7 and its memory complexity is 2 to

495
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,200
96 feet

496
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,520
and we also uh give a linear craft

497
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,960
analysis result on sunday gift and for

498
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,440
sunday gift it also has the birthday

499
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,559
bond

500
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,440
so its date complexity should be less

501
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,600
than two to sixty four

502
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,039
so we use some short uh 10 run linear

503
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,720
trio with its input mask and output mask

504
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,840
shown in the slab to attack

505
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,600
it

506
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,600
and then finally we attack its 16

507
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,000
one version with four extended rounds at

508
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,640
the top and two extended around that at

509
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,799
the bottom

510
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,440
for this attack procedure the data

511
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,840
complexity is two two 2260 and the temp

512
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,760
complexity is 2 to 91.2

513
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,080
and the memory complexity is 2 to 96 bit

514
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,880
speed wide

515
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
we give a summary of the differential

516
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,960
and the linear field of gift one to it

517
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,080
by the time this paper is submitted

518
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
as shown in this list we can find that

519
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,320
our differential trill is not the

520
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,159
longest

521
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,200
but we give the longest attack

522
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,679
for of gifted one to eat and the

523
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,600
following trios

524
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,520
our

525
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,600
our distinguisher is the longest

526
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,640
and here is the summary of our cropped

527
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,320
analysis result of the gift one to eat

528
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,400
we give the uh

529
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,720
best differential curve than lashes and

530
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,799
the linear cropped nuts is a result of

531
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,600
gift when to eat

532
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,240
ok thank you
