00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,879
hi everyone

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,520
this work is about the probable security

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,240
of a novel blog cipher paradigm named

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,719
the sp network with partial non-linear

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,160
layers

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,719
the work is cooperated with francois

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,960
which

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,400
i mentioned we studied a novel blog

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,640
cipher structure named sp network with

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,119
partial non-linear layers that is

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,199
obtained by removing a part of the

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,560
x-boxes in a normal sp network

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,360
as shown in this picture

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,680
for this structure we provide the first

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,800
systematic probable security treatments

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,680
prove security against the cca attacks

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,360
and approve security against the

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,840
impossible differential attacks we also

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,760
show tighter bonds on the number of

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,320
active hotboxes in differential trails

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,039
and provide principled linear layers

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,399
that can help achieve this tight bonds

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,199
this means the paradigm is sound or even

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,760
advantageous in a well-defined sense

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,320
to see the results let's first talk

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,439
about some background

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,600
so consider the problem of designing a

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,760
block cipher we have two famous

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,159
approaches the first is the physical

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,720
network and its generalizations see this

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,680
picture

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,720
in every round of such structures only a

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,960
part of the intermediate state will go

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,680
slowly we'll go through the non-linear

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,079
wrong function and this part is kept in

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,799
the output a well-known instance is of

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,119
course the data encryption standard

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,759
the second is the sp network see this

39
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,720
picture

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,520
in this structure in every round the

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,240
entire input is divided into a number of

42
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,680
chunks and every chunk goes into a

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,520
non-linear x-box

44
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,840
the outputs of the x-boxes are then

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,119
merged with a linear diffusion layer t

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,680
an important example is the advanced

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,240
encryption standard under the relevantly

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,960
accepted iso standards such as screening

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,839
and dialysis

50
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,679
this work is to consider an exception

51
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,599
lying between the two approaches see

52
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,080
this picture

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,800
as far as we know the motivation to use

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,280
this structure was due to side channel

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,400
masking

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
in detail to protect the implementation

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,800
of a block cipher against the power

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,440
analysis and other side channel attacks

59
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,440
one will use secret sharing based

60
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,640
techniques

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,400
dividing the secret keys and the

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
intermediate states into shares and

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,000
operate other shares with the hope that

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,400
every share leaks independently and this

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,720
could reduce the total amount of side

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,879
channel information leakages

67
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,200
because the end action is non-linear

68
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,840
with respect to xor

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,920
and actions on these shares are

70
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,000
difficult and more expensive

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,480
it is as natural to seek for new block

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,040
ciphers with less and actions as

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
possible

74
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,040
the first attempt was made at chess 2013

75
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,200
providing a blog cipher named zorro

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,000
the central idea is to reshape the aes

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
so concretely in the aes

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,840
the substitution layer has 16 parallel

79
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,040
applications of an 8-bit xbox

80
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,599
xylo replaces the xbox with a lighter

81
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,239
one and reduces the number of and gates

82
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,040
in every xbox evaluation but more

83
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,200
importantly

84
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,959
xiao only keeps

85
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,920
four x-boxes in every substitution step

86
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,640
and removes the other three quarters and

87
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,040
this reduces the security of the run

88
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,680
function to compensate for this weaker

89
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,840
round function lower increases the

90
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,120
number of runs from 10 unit aes to 12 in

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,000
zero so the total number of xbox

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,400
evaluations in the whole encryption is

93
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,720
radios from

94
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,840
160 in aes to

95
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,120
48 in zorro

96
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,519
and as mentioned every xbox is lighter

97
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,720
than aes

98
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,680
as well so this significantly reduces

99
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
the total cost of

100
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,760
masking

101
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,879
this novel block cipher structure is

102
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,759
called sp network with partial nonlinear

103
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,160
layers in subsequent works or partial

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,639
azure networks for synthesis

105
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,280
besides the max scheme block ciphers

106
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,160
evaluated in the mpc engine also desire

107
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,400
less and actions

108
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
this scenario is even more extreme

109
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,600
because

110
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,080
exhaust actions can be evaluated locally

111
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,360
in the pc engine while and actions incur

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,120
communication overheads and the

113
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,280
communication is the current bottleneck

114
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,479
of mpc so subsequent designs let's

115
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,160
follow this paradigm

116
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,880
uh including low mc highest paradigm and

117
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,759
the malicious for the mpc block ciphers

118
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,600
so for the remaining let's recall the

119
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,960
idea for clearness uh given a normal sp

120
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,919
network assume that the number of chunks

121
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,800
here is w for example in this picture we

122
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,320
have four chunks

123
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,800
and we remove a number of x-boxes to

124
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,280
obtain the partial sp network structure

125
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,120
and we call the number of remaining

126
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,840
x-boxes divided by w the rate of the

127
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,160
structure for example in this picture we

128
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,639
have four chunks but only two of them

129
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,039
goes through the xbox so the rate is two

130
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,320
divided by four or one divided by two

131
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,039
the normal spin is a special case of

132
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,840
such

133
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,840
partial sp network with rate one

134
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,039
our community has conjectured several

135
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,960
other contextual advantages of the

136
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,919
partialized networks so for example

137
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,840
obviously one would think

138
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,600
that to achieve the same level of

139
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
security pspns consume less non-linear

140
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,199
actions than normal experience

141
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,199
of course this is a very motivation of

142
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,440
using this structure

143
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,240
the bar-on contractor conjecture that by

144
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,680
trading stronger linear layers with

145
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,840
some x-boxes

146
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,680
can achieve more security against the

147
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,919
structural attacks such as impossible

148
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,720
and

149
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,479
differential and

150
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,919
integral

151
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,880
we will study the models of partial sp

152
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,360
networks and try to shed some lights on

153
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,080
these questions

154
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,120
let's now see our results

155
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,680
we prove cca security for partial sp

156
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,479
networks with rate 1 divided by 2 and

157
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,160
the security against the impossible

158
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,479
differential attacks for four runs when

159
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,919
the rate is at least three quarters

160
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,319
finally we provide the first principle

161
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,840
the linear layers

162
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,560
this ensures a tighter number of activex

163
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,360
boxes in differentials so let's now see

164
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,160
the results one by one

165
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,479
we first recall the setting for cca

166
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,680
security

167
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,919
in this setting a distinguisher has two

168
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,240
oracles the right oral code is

169
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,000
underlying as boxes

170
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,960
modeled as public random permutations

171
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,280
in the real world the last oracle is the

172
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,240
partial ft network using a random key

173
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,639
in the ideal world the left oracle is a

174
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,599
wn beta wide random permutation and the

175
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,160
distinguisher has to tell about the two

176
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,520
words

177
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,680
and its advantage is defined in this

178
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,240
expression

179
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
and

180
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,240
we first show a chosen context

181
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,639
differential humoration attack on three

182
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,520
runs

183
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,599
even if the x-boxes and the linear

184
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,440
transformations in the third ones are

185
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,720
independent

186
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,440
the idea is as follows

187
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,240
let's consider the linear layer t1 in

188
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,120
the first round since only a half of the

189
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,440
chunks have x-boxes

190
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
it is always possible to derive a

191
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,319
differential on t1 with input and output

192
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,319
differences of this form

193
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,960
the right half of the input difference

194
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,000
has no active x-box while the right half

195
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,160
of the output difference has only one

196
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,919
active xbox and the difference is data

197
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,840
so after this output difference

198
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,720
propagator along the second xbox layer

199
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,759
the

200
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,520
live

201
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,160
half is environment since there is no s

202
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,360
box and the right half has at most the

203
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,599
total n possibilities here

204
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,360
so after the difference further

205
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,160
propagate along the second linear layer

206
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,440
t2 the left half here has at the most

207
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,000
the total n possibilities as well and

208
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,559
these possibilities can be computed and

209
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,519
kept

210
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,399
so by this requires a construction

211
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,039
oracle with a pair of plant taxes with

212
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,360
input difference but

213
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,240
one connect concatenated with zeros and

214
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,880
check if the left half of the output

215
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,959
difference is in the total n

216
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,000
possibilities that we can predict

217
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,240
the time complexity is good to earn but

218
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,880
the primary complexity is just long so

219
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,439
they attacked

220
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,000
another assumption that first

221
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,959
all the xbox evaluations in the network

222
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,640
use the same as box as an s is an n-bit

223
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
public random implementation

224
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,560
and second the same linear

225
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,200
transformations t is used in the five

226
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,760
runs and the t is a

227
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,000
linear transformation slightly stronger

228
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
than the mds permutation

229
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,120
and finally the first and the final key

230
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,080
addition are using two

231
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,399
uniformly distributed keys k0 and k5 so

232
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,760
with these assumptions and assume that

233
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,600
distinguished makes qc queries to the

234
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,000
left construction oracle and the qrs

235
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,959
queries to the right xbox oracle we

236
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,200
prove such a security bond

237
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,080
this type of robust bond is commonly in

238
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,680
similar probable security treatments

239
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
programmable cca security bond is

240
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,920
limited by the size of the random

241
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,680
primitives in use

242
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,560
which is very small in our context so

243
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,680
for example the aes parameters have n

244
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,160
equals eight and uh our boundary implies

245
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,279
security up to only two to four calories

246
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,200
this is of course of no practical

247
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,240
meaning

248
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,480
but the interesting point is that now we

249
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,360
see

250
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,519
the partial skin network can be improved

251
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,000
secure in the same model as the normal

252
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,240
sp network and generalize the physical

253
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,480
networks so we can have a fair

254
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,560
comparison about their advantages or

255
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,160
disadvantages

256
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,959
so in particular to achieve ccl security

257
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,320
the pspn network uses the rate of one

258
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,440
divided by two and five zones so

259
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,720
it is in total five w divided by two as

260
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,560
boxes

261
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,480
to achieve the same result the normal

262
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,680
spn will use three rounds unless it use

263
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,360
three ws boxes which is more so in some

264
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,680
sense we confirmed the conjecture that

265
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
the psg in india consumes less

266
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,920
nonlinearity for security in a formal

267
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,279
sense

268
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,120
but of course the interpretation should

269
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,040
be considered in caution

270
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,680
we need to prove the advantage but the

271
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,160
model we use may be a bit debatable

272
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,079
we now see the second result uh we also

273
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,480
begin with citing

274
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,959
with small random primitives uh we

275
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,959
cannot go the security balance for

276
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,440
general adversaries as we discussed so

277
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,519
another approach is to global security

278
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,160
against certain types of attacks

279
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,040
in this respect

280
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,920
a model to prove security against

281
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
impossible differential attacks

282
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,880
it assumes any differential with

283
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,680
non-zero input and output differences is

284
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,640
possible on the xbox so this eliminates

285
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,519
the details of the xbox and the greatest

286
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,680
simplifies the analysis and enable the

287
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,600
security proofs against the impossible

288
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,880
differential

289
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,200
so sunnyvale called block ciphers with

290
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,920
such ideologues as ones as block cipher

291
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,560
structures and a core regional analysis

292
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,320
structural analysis

293
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,079
in this setting they were able to

294
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,920
establish probable impossible

295
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,519
differential security for several

296
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,839
structures

297
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,160
our result should be interpreted as

298
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,200
follows

299
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,440
there is no fall on the impossible

300
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,360
differential distinguisher when i write

301
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,959
exceeds three quarters as the details of

302
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,120
the components in the block ciphers are

303
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,320
considered

304
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,720
this positive result is better than the

305
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,920
analogue on aes live sdns because the

306
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,160
later needs five runs

307
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,320
and because it's the later use the

308
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,720
linear layer that is much weaker than

309
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,920
mds

310
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,480
so the result means it engine makes

311
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,320
sense to trade the stronger linear

312
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,959
layers with boxes and the structural

313
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,920
security may be improved

314
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,720
for our last result we consider sparse

315
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,600
pspns with rate much smaller than one

316
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
divided by two

317
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,320
this sort of parameter is indeed used in

318
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,399
low mc and hardisk

319
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,279
for simplicity we assume that reciprocal

320
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,240
of r is an integral rule

321
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,440
for example in this figure we have 12

322
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,480
chunks

323
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,920
but only two have x-boxes so it's rated

324
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,839
one divided by six and then the

325
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,480
reciprocal rho equals 6.

326
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
a folklore here is that

327
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,000
there are always existing rho -1 around

328
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,800
the differential trails with probability

329
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,600
1

330
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,839
because the trio could just avoid to

331
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,199
have active xbox in the low runs

332
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,519
for example this one

333
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,199
this example has

334
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,040
five wrong differential trail with

335
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
probability one

336
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,120
then the question is how to design the

337
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,240
linear layers to ensure a security lower

338
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,519
bound

339
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,480
this there was no obvious answer and

340
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,360
as a consequence law and c use the

341
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,320
distinct possible random linear

342
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,920
permutations in the rounds

343
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,800
to address this question our idea is

344
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
actually very simple let's recall the

345
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,600
idea of using mds transformation to

346
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,760
ensure optimal differential security in

347
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,600
two rounds

348
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,000
in two rounds the linear transformation

349
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,880
t is designed to such that

350
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,959
every one

351
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,959
every two rounds every one one

352
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,360
differential data one two data

353
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,440
yield a cure a cold water of an mds code

354
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,519
then the mds property will ensure a

355
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,519
lower bound on the weight of the cold

356
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,800
water and this later becomes a lower

357
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,440
bond on the number of active responses

358
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,560
in the

359
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,959
one long differential

360
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,680
we generalize this idea to the pspn with

361
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,079
very small rate

362
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,720
a rolls on the differential trail could

363
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,000
have zero active xbox but in this case

364
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,199
the raw difference is data one per data

365
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,560
row will yield a cold water of a mdx

366
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,800
code with long curved watts

367
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,959
then the mdx property

368
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,199
will ensure a lower bound on the number

369
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,480
of as active as boxes in the long runs

370
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,399
then by an analysis

371
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,480
using combined networks

372
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,880
this would ensure at least one active

373
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,079
xbox in every row round differential and

374
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,279
which is tight

375
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,000
so with this idea we construct an mds

376
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,959
code and use this generalization

377
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,920
the generation matrix to have 0 -1

378
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,480
distinct linear transformations and then

379
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,320
we can use the raw minus one

380
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,839
transformations for the rate of pspn

381
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,079
while distinct rounds still have to use

382
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,720
distinctly linear transformations uh we

383
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,880
have a clear underlying mathematical

384
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,480
principle compared with the choices

385
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,079
so with this idea we constructed an mds

386
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,720
code and use the generation matrix to

387
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,959
have rho -1 distinct linear

388
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,519
transformations it has only used these

389
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,600
transformations for the greater arcgis

390
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,560
pn

391
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,399
while distinctly around the studio how

392
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,120
to use distinctly linear transformations

393
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,040
now we have a clear underlying

394
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,240
mathematical principle compared with the

395
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,199
ad hoc

396
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,800
choice in low emc

397
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,240
mds codes only exist for certain

398
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,079
parameters and this limits the

399
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,399
effectiveness of our approach

400
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,639
we thus list a number of possible

401
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,040
combinations of parameters that our

402
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,199
approach work

403
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,720
using larger as boxes means injecting a

404
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,920
larger field in the cold wars and mds

405
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,079
codes exist for

406
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,959
more parallel possible parameters as

407
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,600
reflected by the more frequent check

408
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,199
marks in the right columns so by this we

409
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,000
advocate using large but weak as boxes

410
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,319
in parallel spn ciphers

411
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,000
use large isobox to ensure the existence

412
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,559
of the mds code and the effectiveness of

413
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,359
our approach while the xbox could be

414
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,439
cryptographically weak to reduce the

415
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,520
implementation overhead

416
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,599
such as boxes can be built by the

417
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,760
approach of the factory or using the

418
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,440
regularly proposed aix box

419
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,559
finally we'd like to mention a triple

420
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,880
extension of our final result

421
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
our linear transformations ensure at

422
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,039
least the one activex box in usual

423
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:41,919
rounds

424
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,559
and by composing this result it ensures

425
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,760
at least the trtos boxes in every key

426
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,120
role runs

427
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,160
so while the result is trivial it seems

428
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,360
a useful starting point for mpc oriented

429
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,960
log cyphers

430
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,280
more clearly what could begin with an

431
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,520
instantiation of our construction and

432
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,840
then seek for more fine-grained security

433
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,559
analysis and refinements and this may

434
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,039
give rise to elegant and secure psp and

435
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,520
cyphers

436
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,559
to conclude we make the first step

437
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,480
towards understanding the theoretical

438
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,440
summaries of the partial sp networks

439
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,000
provide the first systematic probable

440
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,679
security treatments

441
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,720
regarding

442
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,679
different security definitions and our

443
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,760
approach to design the linear layers

444
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,760
of course there are a number of

445
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,720
possibilities for filter including to

446
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,799
weaken the assumptions of security

447
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,400
proofs against the impossible

448
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,360
differentials to seek for new sprp

449
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,400
encryption modes from the pspn structure

450
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,640
and to seek for more applications of

451
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,520
large but weak xbox methodology in

452
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,280
concrete block ciphers

453
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
also one may consider the security of

454
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,760
the forerunner on the pspn with rate 1

455
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,440
divided by 2

456
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,760
since we were unable to find the either

457
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,000
attacks or proofs

458
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,840
though we believe the most interesting

459
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,240
point is to seek for a more persuasive

460
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,880
theory results justifying or dismissing

461
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,600
the advantages of pspns

462
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,440
we prove their advantage

463
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
in the spip mode

464
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,720
but the model is as much debatable

465
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
so for example what about algebra

466
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,360
degrees can the lower bounds on the

467
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,559
degrees justify the advantages

468
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,120
we hope our work could incur more such

469
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,200
investigations

470
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,360
thank you for listening and of course

471
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,918
comments are welcome
