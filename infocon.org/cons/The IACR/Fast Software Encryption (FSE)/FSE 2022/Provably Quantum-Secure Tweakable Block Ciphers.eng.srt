00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,640
hello i'm martin alhusayamada from nlt

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,879
social informatics laboratories

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,800
this is autocompreviously quantum

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,280
central tweakable block ciphers

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,719
this is actually going to work with tits

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,759
ivata from nagoya university

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,760
so this is the summary of our results

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,320
first copyright all showed that some tvs

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,279
modes over pcs such as llw constructions

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,359
are completely broken by polynomial time

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,439
quantum query attacks

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,439
and there has been no tv symbols proven

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,120
to be essential against quantum query

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,880
attacks

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,760
and in our paper we showed a new scheme

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,120
error w2 which is a tvc mode of block

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,480
ciphers

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,520
and we believe that aerial w2 is secured

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,000
against quantum clearly attacks

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,920
this is the summary of our results

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,199
next i would like to explain about the

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,399
background of our research

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,239
first i'd like to include the classical

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,000
attack model of chosen plain text

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,760
attacks

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,840
in the classical attack model we usually

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,000
assume there is an adversary who has a

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,920
classical computer and there is an

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,760
encryption oracle

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,759
and the adversary is allowed to make

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,280
many queries to the encryption workload

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,240
and if a message m is equal to the

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,400
encryption oracle then the oracle

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,640
returns the corresponding ciphertext to

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,960
the adversary

36
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
so this is the classical attack module

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,399
of chosen plaintext attacks

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,759
next i'd like to explain about two

39
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,840
attack models in the quantum setting

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,320
the first model is called the q1 model

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,159
in this model the computer of the

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,240
adversary is replaced with a quantum one

43
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,079
so the adversary can

44
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,840
use quantum computers for offline

45
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,759
computations

46
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,320
but the encryption oracle is unchanged

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,520
from the classical setting

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,360
and in other words you can make many

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,680
classical queries to the workload

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,800
this is the two-way curve model

51
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,480
and the other model in the quantum

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,119
setting is

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,319
this one

54
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,640
which is called the tutu module

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,560
in this model the oracle is also

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,800
replaced with a quantum one quantum

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,879
encryption oracle

58
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,120
and now all of computations and

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
communications between the oracle and

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,959
adversary are done in quantum

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,120
superposition

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,920
so they adversely they can make queries

63
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
in some quantum superposition

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,040
and the response from oracle is also

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,319
in quantum superposition

66
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,280
so this is the tutor model

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,840
and apparently the ability of the

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,400
adversary in this model q2 model is much

69
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,280
stronger than the ability of adversary

70
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,560
in this module because in the co2 model

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,040
both of computations and communications

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,480
are the quantum superposition

73
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,200
so these are the two main attack models

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,079
in the quantum setting

75
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,879
next i'd like to explain about quantum

76
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,040
centric notions

77
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,879
so there are two significant notions in

78
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,159
the quantum setting

79
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,360
standard security and quantum security

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,840
the first one is security against q1

81
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,640
attacks or classical query attacks

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,959
and the second one is security against

83
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,400
q2 attacks or quantum query attacks

84
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,560
and apparently the first one standard

85
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,400
security is important

86
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
because in the cuva model the oracle is

87
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,560
the same as the classical one and so the

88
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,840
qr model will be realistic as soon as a

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,599
large scale falls tolerant quantum

90
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,159
computers are available

91
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,000
and sometimes

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
the word post-content security just

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,680
means only standard security

94
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,840
but here i'd like to influence that

95
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,000
studying quantum security is also

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,840
important

97
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,040
and here

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,599
i'd like to explain three reasons

99
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,680
the first reason is that studying

100
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,519
quantum security is theoretically

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,640
interesting

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,599
because

103
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,040
many things

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,560
do not that do not happen in the

105
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,478
classical setting happen in the tutor

106
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,079
model

107
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,199
for instance

108
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,880
some symmetrical schemes that are

109
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,400
prevalent to basically in the classical

110
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
setting are completely broken in

111
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,199
polynomial time in the q2 module

112
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,120
and so studying quantum security is

113
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,520
theoretically interesting

114
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,919
and second considering q2 model will be

115
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,080
plausible in the far future when lots of

116
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,000
computations and communications are in

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,720
quantum superposition

118
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,360
and finally if a stream is proven to be

119
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
secure and institute attacks

120
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,840
then the stream is secure against all

121
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,680
attacks in arbitrarily intermediate

122
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,360
models between q1 and l2 and we can

123
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,520
claim that the scheme is secure against

124
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,360
all possible black box query attacks

125
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,479
so these are the three reasons that i

126
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,400
i think studying quantum security is

127
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,638
also important

128
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
next i'd like to explain about the

129
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,240
motivation behind our research

130
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,400
first i'd like to record a very basics

131
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,199
about tweakable block ciphers

132
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,320
uh so to make of a block cipher or tbc

133
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,240
is a block cipher that takes an

134
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,880
additional input called tweak

135
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,479
and the tweaks are supposed to be

136
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,560
completely public

137
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,199
and if a different tweak value is used

138
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,000
uh to uh such a trick of a block cipher

139
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,840
then a completely different and the

140
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,520
independent block cipher is instantiated

141
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,360
and the tweakable block ciphers are used

142
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,000
in many efficient and high residual a is

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,560
max and so on

144
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,479
and there are two approaches to build

145
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,240
tweakable block ciphers

146
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,840
the first approach is

147
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,960
to build tbc as a dedicated primitive

148
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,880
like skinny

149
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,720
and another approach is to build a

150
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,039
trickle block cipher as a mode of block

151
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,440
ciphers like the error w construction

152
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,400
and our focus is the second approach

153
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,280
and next i'd like to recall uh basics

154
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,560
about lrw constructions

155
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,440
uh so the lrw constructions are the most

156
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,160
basic model block ciphers so for

157
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,080
tweakable block ciphers introduced by

158
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,479
risk of rebes and wagner

159
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,440
and there are two variants lrw1 and lrw2

160
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,919
so this construction was proven to be

161
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,759
secure in the classical setting

162
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,840
but in crypto 2016 kaplan is also

163
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,560
this construction llw2

164
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,400
is completely broken

165
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,319
by a polynomial time due to a bank

166
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,479
and actually a similar attack works on

167
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,599
error w1 so

168
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,000
eventually these possible two

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,240
constructions are completely broken in

170
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,919
polynomial time by due to attacks

171
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,400
and next i'd like to explain how the

172
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,840
tutor attacks work

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,880
so here i'd like to explain both of the

174
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,039
attacks on error w1 in their roundup

175
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,240
value too

176
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,479
but i do not have enough time to explain

177
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,759
both attacks

178
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,759
so here i'd like to focus on the attack

179
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,080
on lrw1

180
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,440
first define a function f like this f of

181
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,160
t is equal to error w1 over m zero and t

182
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,360
plus rrw1 over a1 and t

183
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,520
here m0 and m1 are some fixed constants

184
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,160
and then define a value s like this

185
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,680
e k over m 0 plus e k over m1

186
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
this is a secret value depending on the

187
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,840
secret t

188
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,720
k

189
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,400
then with some straightforward

190
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,280
calculation uh we can confirm that this

191
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,599
function f is periodic and s is the

192
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,639
field

193
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,520
that is f of t plus this is equal to f

194
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,318
of t this equation holds for rt

195
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,479
and this means that the periodic can be

196
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,479
recovered by applying simon's quantum

197
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,240
period finding algorithm on this

198
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,919
function f

199
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,479
here please note that this algorithm

200
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,919
simon's quantum algorithm is a

201
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,440
polynomial time

202
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,039
algorithm that finds a period of

203
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,039
periodic function

204
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,640
and please note that

205
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,719
now we are assuming the adversary can

206
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,559
make quantum superposition queries to

207
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,599
error w1 so the other ones that you can

208
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,679
evaluate this function with in quantum

209
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,480
supervision and that's the adversary uh

210
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,320
young apple simon's quantum algorithm on

211
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,720
this function f

212
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,399
and next suppose that this error w1

213
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,800
is replaced with a tweakable random

214
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,000
publication or ideally random tweakable

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,839
block cipher

216
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,080
then even if the adversary applies

217
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,880
simon's algorithm on this function f

218
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,839
the simon algorithm will not return any

219
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,760
period

220
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,160
and so the otherwise you can distinguish

221
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,839
error w1 from

222
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,480
tweakable random permutation or ideally

223
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,560
a random clickable block server by

224
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,480
checking if simon's algorithm will

225
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,200
return a period or not in polynomial

226
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,120
time

227
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,760
so this is a very rough overview about

228
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,279
how the attack on error w1 works

229
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,200
then

230
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,440
now the important point is so far there

231
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,440
does not exist any tbc mode with

232
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,600
provable security against due to attacks

233
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
or quantum query attacks

234
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,240
and this is the starting point or the

235
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,640
punctuation of our research

236
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,160
and our goal

237
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,440
in our paper is to build a tvc mode with

238
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,360
probable security at least due to

239
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,959
attacks or quantum quality attacks

240
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,320
next i'd like to introduce our new

241
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,079
construct construction

242
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,880
error w2

243
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,920
so recall that lrw1 construction looks

244
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680
like this this is secure in the

245
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,279
classical setting but broken in qt model

246
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,040
and very roughly speeding the reason

247
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,760
that

248
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,160
this structure is completely probable in

249
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,199
the duty model is that

250
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,720
a key dependent value each of m this

251
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560
value is added or x1 with a variable t

252
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,079
and the full control of adversaries

253
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,040
so this is a very rough reason that

254
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,399
rlw1 is completely verbal in

255
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,399
tutor module i mean

256
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,320
if such a property holds

257
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,160
we can make a periodic function from

258
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,560
this structure and we can present

259
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,640
algorithm to break this scheme

260
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,600
and so to prevent uh or to

261
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,760
break a such property we introduce

262
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,399
additional block cipher code here

263
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,600
and this is our new construction lrw2

264
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,920
and we use three different keys k1 and

265
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,399
k2 and tsu for different block cipher

266
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,920
calls

267
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,399
and so by introducing additional block

268
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,279
ciphers here we can prevent attacks

269
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,480
using simon's quantum algorithm

270
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,000
and next i'd like to

271
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,920
explain about how we improved the

272
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,480
security of lrw2 construction against

273
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,440
quantum query attacks

274
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,640
so this is our main result error w2 this

275
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,519
one

276
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,360
is indistinguishable from tweakable

277
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,839
random permutation by q2 attacks up to

278
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,839
order 2 to the power and over 6 quantum

279
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,519
encryption queries

280
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,839
that means error who is secure against

281
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,959
quantum chosen plaintext attacks

282
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,800
and here please note that we do not

283
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
claim any security against the quantum

284
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,800
chosen ciphertext attacks

285
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,720
and we assume adversaries can create

286
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
both of m and d in quantum superposition

287
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,200
i will explain details about security

288
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,959
harnessed the quantum chosen ciphertext

289
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,440
status later

290
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,480
and to prove this theorem we used the

291
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,800
compressed oracle technique

292
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,279
and next i'd like to explain a brief

293
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,720
overview about this technique

294
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,600
so in the quantum setting one of the

295
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,680
most significant difficulties improving

296
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,000
this quantum security is that it is not

297
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,600
trivial how to record queries to oracles

298
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,680
so in the classical setting it is very

299
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
trivial that a major record queries to

300
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,560
oracles or response from locals

301
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,279
but in the content setting if we

302
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,200
record queries to the oracles in the

303
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,320
naive way

304
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,800
then it completely sometimes it

305
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,279
completely breaks the quantum state of

306
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,360
the adversary and the proof does not

307
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,560
work

308
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,040
and so in the quantum setting it is

309
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,880
non-trivial how to record queries to

310
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
oracles

311
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,360
but in 2019 chandler

312
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,760
introduced a very useful technique which

313
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,639
is named the compressed oracle technique

314
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,839
this technique enables us to record

315
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,040
queries and responses of random

316
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,000
functions to some extent

317
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,519
and actually

318
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,720
this technique is somewhat

319
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,120
closed or similar to the classical lazy

320
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,639
sampling

321
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,320
and the behavior of the compressed

322
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,399
oracle for a random function f looks

323
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,920
like this

324
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,199
uh first if a first value x is equal to

325
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,519
the compressed oracle

326
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,000
then the oracle lazily samples the value

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,600
y is equal to f of x and then record the

328
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,120
pair x and f of x in the database

329
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,079
and so

330
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,920
this oracle compressor oracle keeps a

331
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,720
database which starts history of queries

332
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,160
and responses

333
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,199
like the classical daisy sampling

334
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,760
and next if a known phrase value x is

335
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,240
equivalent to the oracle then the

336
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,160
compressed oracle returns the recorded

337
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,279
value

338
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,120
this part is the same as the classical

339
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,560
lazy sampling

340
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,639
but unlike the classical laser sampling

341
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,360
the compressed oracle sometimes removes

342
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,639
or relies the record if necessary

343
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,760
so this is

344
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
somewhat different from the classical

345
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,000
lazy sampling and this may seem somewhat

346
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,440
weird but

347
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,079
this part is essential to record queries

348
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,560
in the quantum shifting

349
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,360
and so this part is somewhat different

350
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,120
from the classical lazy sampling but

351
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,000
still this technique enables us to use

352
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,680
the intuition on classical laser

353
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,040
sampling to some extent

354
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
so this is a rough overview of

355
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,240
compressed workable technique

356
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,560
and next

357
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,079
i would like to explain

358
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,320
how to improve the indistinguishability

359
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,600
of this construction error w2 and

360
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,240
a tweakable random foundation or either

361
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,800
random tweakable block cipher

362
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,959
and to prove in distinguishability i

363
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,639
would like to use the compressed oracle

364
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,519
technique and

365
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,279
please note that the compressed oracle

366
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,440
technique is applicable only to random

367
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,880
functions

368
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,959
and it is not applicable for

369
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,240
other

370
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,160
other primitives such as random

371
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
publications

372
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,920
and so next

373
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,199
hour first

374
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,519
i would like to change these schemes so

375
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,240
that

376
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
they will be composed of only random

377
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,480
functions

378
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
and first

379
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,759
by assuming

380
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,079
the underlying block ciphers etc we can

381
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,199
replace the block ciphers

382
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,880
to random publications rp0 rp1 rp2 like

383
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,000
this

384
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,040
and the security loss will be very small

385
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,800
if the underlying block cipher is

386
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,359
essential

387
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,040
and next i would like to also replace

388
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,560
random pump stations into random

389
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,079
functions rf0 rf1 and rf2

390
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,639
and the security laws due to changing

391
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,040
random permutations to random functions

392
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,720
is like this

393
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,839
and this certificate is still small

394
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,920
substantially small if the number of

395
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,199
quantum queries q is not so large

396
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,519
and next i'd like to also replace this

397
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,279
tweakable random permutation into a

398
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,000
random function

399
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,920
like this

400
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,399
and now the static loss of changing

401
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,240
tweakable random permutation into a

402
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,000
single random function of two inputs

403
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,839
is like this

404
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,639
so again this segment loss is not so

405
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,680
large sufficiently small if the number

406
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,600
of quantum queries q is not large

407
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,399
and next i'd like to change

408
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,279
this random function further so that

409
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,920
the structures of this function and this

410
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,880
function

411
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,800
will be close to each other as much as

412
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,199
possible

413
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,959
and i would like to change

414
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,919
this random function

415
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,919
like this

416
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,959
so again these are f0 rf1 are random

417
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,079
functions

418
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,039
and this r wave is also another

419
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,199
independent random function

420
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,039
and this random function takes three

421
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,280
inputs m and this sum and this t

422
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,599
and this structure seems a little bit

423
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,360
more complicated than

424
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,480
just a single random function but still

425
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,640
the distribution output distribution of

426
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,919
this structure is completely the same as

427
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,080
the output this distribution of random

428
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,120
function because this r vector big takes

429
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,760
m and t they separate themselves as

430
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,360
inputs

431
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,240
and so there is no significance for

432
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,720
changing a random function to this

433
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,919
complex structure

434
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
and i would like to call this structure

435
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,559
as fos f small and i'd like to call this

436
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,520
structure as fusific

437
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,919
and please note that these functions are

438
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,840
f 0 r f 1 and r f 2 and r big these are

439
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
random functions and we can use the

440
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,600
compressed oracle technique to these

441
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,000
functions

442
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,760
and next

443
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,200
please remember that

444
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,640
the compressed oracle keeps a database

445
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,440
that uh two straw history of queries and

446
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,280
responses

447
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,000
and so the oracle of this structure fsf

448
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,400
small keeps three databases

449
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,120
database d04 rf2 and database d1 for rf1

450
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,240
and database d2 for rf2

451
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,320
and similarly the oracle

452
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
of this structure gives three databases

453
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,120
d0 and d1 and dbq

454
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,678
and next

455
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,960
suppose that the tuple of database d0

456
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,440
and d1 and d2 for this structure does

457
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,480
not contain any collision here

458
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,360
at inputs to the rf2

459
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,280
and we say that such

460
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,559
database is good or such a good database

461
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,678
is a good database

462
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,400
and similarly

463
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,520
we say that

464
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,480
if a table of data is d0 and d1 and db

465
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,120
does not contain any equation here

466
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,600
then we say that this is a good database

467
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,400
and now the important thing is

468
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,919
there is a natural one to one

469
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,840
correspondence between the set of good

470
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,640
databases for this construction and the

471
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,960
good uh the set of good databases for

472
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,760
this construction

473
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,120
and roughly speaking this means that

474
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
the component of quantum state of the

475
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,840
adversary interacting with fusif small

476
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,400
containing good databases is almost

477
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
equal to the component of quantum state

478
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,200
of the adversary interacting with fsf

479
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,039
weak containing good databases

480
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,039
and intuitively this further means that

481
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,159
the two functions face if small and f is

482
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,880
big these are indistinguishable as long

483
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,159
as databases are good

484
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,000
and so what is remainder to vision is

485
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,480
producing but databases or no good

486
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,760
databases is hard

487
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,679
and next i'd like to explain why we can

488
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,720
show producing non-good databases or but

489
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,960
databases is hard

490
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,200
and please note that a tuple of database

491
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,559
d0 and divine data for fosa if small is

492
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,520
bad or non-good if and only if it

493
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,520
contains a certain kind of collision

494
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,120
like this

495
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,720
in the classical setting showing the

496
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,200
hardness of producing such bad databases

497
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,440
or showing the hardness of

498
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,320
producing such collision is very easy by

499
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,120
using the lazy sampling

500
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,960
and even in the class even in the

501
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,039
quantum setting

502
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,320
thanks to the compressed oracle

503
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,280
technique we can use the intuition of

504
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,600
lazy sampling classical lazy sampling to

505
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,200
some extent

506
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,520
uh because as a compressed oracle uh

507
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,039
very roughly speaking the compressed

508
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,360
work enables us to

509
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
use the classical intuition overseas

510
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,320
sampling to some extent

511
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,039
and so this is a very rough overview

512
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,960
about how we showed

513
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,159
the quantum security of lrw2

514
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,960
and here i would like to

515
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,039
provide some remarks

516
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,760
first error w2 our construction is not

517
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,240
secure against chosen ciphertext attacks

518
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,640
even in the classical setting because

519
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
chosen ciphertext attack making order

520
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,280
one classical queries distinguishing

521
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,159
distinguishes error w2

522
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,640
and second very recently we found some

523
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,039
errors in the details of the proof

524
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,960
actually we observed that

525
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,480
such errors

526
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,720
these errors can be fixed by modifying

527
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,480
the definition of good databases

528
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,559
slightly

529
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,400
and by modifying

530
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,760
this definition

531
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,640
the bound of proportion 8 in our paper

532
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,880
an intermediate probation will be

533
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,919
changed from this one to this one

534
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,240
but unfortunately the final bound this

535
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,960
one will not be changed

536
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,919
and we are preparing a lot and we are

537
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,120
going to

538
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,039
make this error public soon

539
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,840
so finally i'd like to summarize today's

540
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,240
my talk

541
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,080
so first there has been no tvc mode over

542
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,159
pieces proven to be 0 against quantum

543
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,720
query attacks or c2 attacks

544
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,960
and in our paper we introduced a new

545
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,159
construction which we named lrw2

546
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,520
this is a modified version of llw1

547
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,360
and error w2

548
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,280
and we proved that this construction is

549
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,520
0 against quantum query chosen plaintext

550
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,960
attacks

551
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,799
and we used the compressed oracle

552
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,760
technique to prove the accessibility

553
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,200
and actually

554
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,720
recently we found

555
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,559
uh there is some errors there are some

556
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,679
errors

557
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,919
in our proof but we observe that we

558
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,200
observe that

559
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,520
they can be fixed by slightly modifying

560
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,840
the definition of good databases

561
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,280
and we are preparing on errata and we

562
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,400
will make it public soon

563
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,480
and finally i would like to explain uh

564
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,720
possible future work

565
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,360
apparently the important future work is

566
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,720
to come up with

567
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,280
a new construction with security against

568
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,440
quantum chosen ciphertext attacks

569
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
because our construction is not secure

570
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,320
against

571
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,039
chosen ciphertext attacks

572
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,679
but to prove security against quantum

573
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,440
chosen civilized attacks

574
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,120
a permutation version of the compressed

575
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,360
oracle is necessary because

576
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,880
the compressed oracle technique is

577
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,840
applicable only to random functions

578
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,640
but

579
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,320
to provide security against chosen

580
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,120
ciphertext attacks we have to record

581
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,440
queries to the equilibrium oracles

582
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,400
and

583
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,279
to

584
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,799
record queries to the equilibrium

585
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,559
oracles a permutation version of the

586
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,840
complex workflow will be necessary

587
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,000
and recently

588
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,720
some research researchers have been

589
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,440
working on uh developing a permutation

590
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,520
version of the compressed oracle but

591
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,760
as far as i know no one has

592
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,640
success this task is somewhat difficult

593
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,640
but still i think these topics will be

594
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,679
very interesting future works

595
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,799
that's all thank you for your attention
