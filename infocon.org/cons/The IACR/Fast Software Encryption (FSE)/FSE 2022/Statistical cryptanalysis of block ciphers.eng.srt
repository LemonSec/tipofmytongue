[Music]

2
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,000
we're ready to start

3
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,640
go ahead

4
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,680
thank you

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,200
so welcome to the session about

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,760
statistical kryptonisis of block ciphers

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,239
we are starting with a talkback by tug

8
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,719
season who is talking about a formal

9
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,879
analysis of boomerang probabilities and

10
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,199
this is don't work with andreas brazen

11
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,680
kimbos

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,840
all right thank you very much for the

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,520
introduction um luckily uh we talked a

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,960
lot about boomerang for the last two

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,239
days so i don't

16
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,359
i'm not going to give the full

17
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,000
introduction again

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,280
one second

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,320
all right

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,640
so here we have a boomerang um a very

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,799
classical one so boomerangs uh were

22
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,520
invented in 1999 by david wagner

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,320
to attack a block cipher named coconut

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,240
98

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,960
but also in particular to

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,119
disprove the idea

27
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,360
that the absence of

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,880
high probability differentials over the

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,799
entire block cypher is sufficient to

30
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,799
show security against

31
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,680
uh differential cryptanalysis in general

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,880
so in such a boomerang attack we have

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,680
those

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
four differentials

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,040
two on the top from alpha to beta and

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,840
two on the bottom from gamma to delta

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,159
um and we construct uh boomerang

38
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,840
distinguisher by encrypting the sphere

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,920
x0 and x1

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,360
with a difference of alpha and then

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,439
taking the corresponding cipher text c0

42
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,040
and c1 adding

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,719
difference of delta to both of them and

44
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,159
then creating this new ciphertext pair

45
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,280
that we decrypt and checking for this

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,320
uh

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,000
checking in the corresponding plaintext

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,720
for this difference of alpha and in this

49
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,479
classical estimate we assume that these

50
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,720
differentials are independent

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,800
and that gives us this probability of p

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
squared times q squared which where p

53
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,959
and q are the probabilities of those

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,879
differentials

55
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,879
now we know already um

56
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,560
that this is a bit problematic to assume

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
that it's independent

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,560
and uh in our work we wanted to add some

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,920
uh

60
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,760
um some evidence that this can be a bit

61
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,840
of a strange assumption um in the form

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,720
of the following theorem

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,879
namely if we can if we generally assume

64
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,319
that we can treat those

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,480
differentials as independent

66
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,920
and then for every boomerang

67
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
distinguisher as the one we just saw

68
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
there exists a

69
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,840
a better normal differential over the

70
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,080
entire cipher so that stands in a bit of

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,080
a contrast to

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,440
the whole purpose of the invention of

73
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,120
boomerang attacks

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,400
and

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
i want to stress that i don't think this

76
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,720
is true

77
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,440
i mean you can easily construct

78
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,159
pathological counter examples

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,599
it's just something you some of the

80
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,040
strangeness you're into if you assume

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,920
this independence in general

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,680
so the question that we posed ourselves

83
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
was

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,560
can we construct a model in which we can

85
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,239
formally state the probability of this

86
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,159
boom length without relying on these

87
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,560
independence assumptions

88
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,799
and as a starting point we looked at how

89
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,799
we usually treat differential

90
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,959
cryptanalysis

91
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,799
and how we calculate those uh different

92
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,280
uh the probability of differentials

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,200
so in differential equipment we usually

94
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,480
assume that we can treat the rounds as

95
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,319
independent and this is of course an

96
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,680
idealization that one uh always needs to

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
be a bit careful about

98
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,319
but in this model we assume that we can

99
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,760
can treat the rounds independent and

100
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,159
thereby multiply the round probabilities

101
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,680
to calculate

102
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,239
very effectively the probability of a

103
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,400
differential characteristic

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,319
so to create a mathematical model where

105
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,840
we can uh

106
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,720
that represents this property we assume

107
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,560
that before every round a uniformly

108
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,400
random vector is added onto the state

109
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
for each pair

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,080
and the result of that is that we

111
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
basically lose the information of the

112
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,798
exact values in the in the pair and only

113
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,880
uh look at the difference so if we want

114
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,839
to

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,440
extend that for boomerangs in boomerangs

116
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,199
we don't deal with pairs of text but we

117
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,880
deal with quartets or four tuples of

118
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,639
text

119
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,560
but apart from that it's a relatively

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,840
straightforward extension so we assume

121
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,639
that we add a uniformly random constant

122
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,199
onto the uh onto the state before every

123
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,320
round

124
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,639
um for each four table of texts

125
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,560
and that means we reduce the information

126
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,840
containing the four tuples to the

127
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,919
relative differences between those four

128
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,680
texts

129
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,479
um

130
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,160
when we look at

131
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
uh so what does that mean for those four

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,280
tuples

133
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,800
so we here we have a four tuple x0 to x3

134
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,120
and we can uniquely uniquely determine

135
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
the differences between those between

136
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,440
those texts by just stating

137
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
the difference of the last two the last

138
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,080
three texts to the first text

139
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,560
so we can describe x0 to x3 by the three

140
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,360
differences delta 1 to delta 3.

141
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,919
and with this kind of representation

142
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,560
boomerang attack looks like this

143
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,840
um

144
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,800
where we where we state all of the um

145
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,160
where we state the difference to the

146
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,320
last three uh texts

147
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,880
in each uh in state with respect to the

148
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,120
zero index text

149
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,199
and we need to introduce some uh three

150
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,120
variables in some sense so in the top

151
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
the plain text

152
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
in the playtex state it's this variable

153
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,639
eta and then the ciphertext state is

154
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,120
this variable epsilon

155
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,160
um

156
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,759
but in principle so this allows us to

157
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,320
state uh in this model formally what the

158
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,560
probability of a boomerang is check out

159
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,800
the paper for for details

160
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,919
um

161
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,680
and the nice thing that this model

162
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,360
allows us is to to

163
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,039
prove some statements about boomerang

164
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,440
probabilities and i'll give two examples

165
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,720
here

166
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,280
um one is that for two round boomerangs

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,039
on this substitution permutation

168
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,319
networks with four uniform s boxes

169
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,120
the probability of a boomerang deviates

170
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,600
maximally from the classical estimate

171
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,680
so it's either pq or it is zero

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,240
and this allows for both uh this is both

173
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,319
a problem if you have a if you're not

174
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,080
careful with your boomerang and it's

175
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,600
both an opportunity for an attacker

176
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,400
because you can construct uh

177
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,000
a boomerang with much higher probability

178
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,759
and this has been used in a number of

179
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,039
attacks

180
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,160
already

181
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,120
um

182
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,960
and the second statement is kind of like

183
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,759
in contrast to the first

184
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,919
we show that the probability of a pair

185
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,000
to follow the same trail

186
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,840
corresponds to the classical estimate

187
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,199
when you

188
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,960
average over the separating distance of

189
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,360
the pair and the consequence of that is

190
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,160
that you could argue if you uh

191
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,000
the two things you can argue one is that

192
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,880
you

193
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,039
that the classical

194
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,440
probability estimate of a boomerang far

195
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,599
away from the middle layer corresponds

196
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,280
quite closely

197
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,680
to the classical estimate so that the

198
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,360
problems really occur mostly in the

199
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,520
central layer

200
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,039
and the other one is that if you have a

201
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,000
boomerang that is constructed of a large

202
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,319
number of boomerang trails to a large

203
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,080
number of simple boomerangs

204
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,919
um that the classical estimate is likely

205
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,280
to hold again because you are just

206
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
average over a large number of these

207
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,039
trails and we'll give an example at the

208
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,520
very end um

209
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,120
oh actually now

210
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,599
so we looked at two classical um

211
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,360
boomerang attacks

212
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,759
uh on serpent uh one is the amplified

213
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,080
boomerang attack by kerasi kono and

214
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,039
schneider which uses one boomerang

215
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,160
and

216
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,919
we just look at the interior to round

217
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,840
off the boomerang and

218
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,039
that turns out to have zero

219
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,800
probabilities so that boomerang is just

220
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,680
infeasible to find in practice

221
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,319
and the other one is a rectangle attack

222
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,879
by biham dungeon keller which is a more

223
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,080
refined attack where a large number of

224
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,160
trails in the top part and the large

225
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,520
number of trails in the bottom part are

226
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,720
considered

227
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,039
giving a total combination of roughly

228
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
the 53.3

229
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,680
distinct boomerangs and when analyzing

230
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,599
the middle two rounds of those

231
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,440
boomerangs it turns out only 972

232
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,759
have a nonzero probability

233
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,520
and while the first

234
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,720
fear one might have is that this

235
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,319
invalidates the attack it turns out that

236
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,719
these boomerangs have such a drastically

237
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,479
higher probability that the overall

238
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,000
estimate is

239
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,159
even slightly higher than the

240
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,559
estimate given paper so i think by a

241
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,559
factor of 16.

242
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,000
so to summarize

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,680
um

244
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
first we gave a proof that the classical

245
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,880
independence assumption would make

246
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,680
boomerangs superfluous

247
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,120
we formalized the model where you can

248
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,160
state these boomerang probabilities

249
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,880
in a mathematically mathematically pure

250
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,000
sense

251
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,760
and we analyze some classical boomerang

252
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,080
attacks on certain and

253
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,959
considering this new model

254
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,330
thank you very much

255
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,589
[Applause]

256
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,959
is there any question

257
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,240
um

258
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,510
[Music]

259
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,560
the very quite foreign thing about

260
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,240
indian products i wonder what is the

261
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,920
probability space

262
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,200
because you have many things from as you

263
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,120
have a key which is randomly selected

264
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,680
you have some messages which are chosen

265
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,680
or known

266
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,880
from them so when you talk about

267
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,439
independence

268
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,399
so

269
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,480
the randomness uh

270
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,519
also yeah

271
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,640
um so the question is um so there are

272
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,160
many sources of randomness in such an

273
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,760
attack you can from the from the choice

274
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,160
of key from the choice of plain text the

275
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,519
question is where does the where does

276
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,800
the randomness come from that the

277
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,880
probability is taking over in our model

278
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,480
so in our model the randomness all of

279
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
the randomness goes into those random

280
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,760
round constants that we add before the

281
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,120
state

282
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,760
so we don't really look into keys

283
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
i know traditionally one one says that

284
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,279
you have these these round constants are

285
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,000
considered to come from the wrong keys

286
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,160
and we just use them

287
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,760
just abstractly but i think the argument

288
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,519
you would make in practice is that this

289
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,680
randomness comes from plain text in a

290
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,000
sense from the linear part

291
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,040
um

292
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,320
from the linear part in the plain text

293
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,920
that is not going into the differences

294
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
and that you create some uh

295
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,600
this gives you

296
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,839
but the hope is that this is roughly a

297
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,200
uniform distribution on those constants

298
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,079
that would be my argument i hope that's

299
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,040
that answers the question

300
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,800
i will just check that there is a

301
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,839
question online

302
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,680
um

303
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,600
it's okay

304
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,680
this one

305
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,839
i think you can just swipe again

306
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,120
uh link do you know if there are some

307
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,920
questions online

308
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,000
i think they would be in the chat

309
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,120
okay i haven't seen anyone

310
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,560
okay thank you

311
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,000
so thanks to you again

312
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,320
so our second talk is about statistical

313
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,000
model of correlation differences and

314
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,640
relatively linear cryptisis and kaizen

315
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,600
einberg is going to give the talk

316
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,720
and

317
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,959
keizer can you share your screen please

318
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,560
yes i'm trying to do it

319
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,279
okay

320
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,519
i'm sharing i'm trying to share but it

321
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,519
doesn't work

322
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,800
it worked when i tried it can you

323
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,680
oh

324
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,440
just a minute

325
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,720
it seems to work

326
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
yeah no there we are

327
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,760
can you put the you in a full screen

328
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,079
please

329
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,399
i believe it is

330
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,160
okay everything

331
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,600
like a stars

332
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,240
yes please stop yeah okay

333
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,839
so this is my work my paper was about

334
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,120
related key

335
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,839
linear cryptanalysis in related key

336
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,360
cryptanosis

337
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,760
you compute correlations of a linear

338
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,680
approximation

339
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,880
for two different related keys

340
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,720
and of course you need statistical

341
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,519
models to determine the complexity of

342
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,360
the attacks

343
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,760
and now the the problem is that there

344
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,200
are all kinds of statistical

345
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,760
dependencies over the data for example

346
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,000
if you use the same sample to compute

347
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,519
those correlations

348
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,959
and also over the related key pairs

349
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,360
for example for the cipher if there's

350
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,200
some strange property

351
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,279
for the related key which you want to

352
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,839
use you cannot assume that the related

353
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,839
keepers and the correlations computed

354
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,880
for the related keepers are independent

355
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,920
and my feeling was that this was not

356
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,680
properly addressed in the existing

357
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,320
literature where we have

358
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
kind of ad hoc statistical models making

359
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,519
artificial additional assumptions or

360
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,320
just models stated without proofs

361
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,760
so my

362
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,279
the

363
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,000
my goal in this work was to fill

364
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
this gap

365
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,519
for example the first problem is that

366
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,160
the correlation

367
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,560
correlations computed for

368
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,839
even for a random pair of functions if f

369
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,279
and f prime are not fully independent

370
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,360
and we remove this artificial

371
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,519
independent assumption and the second

372
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,800
problem is

373
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,199
that over the data the sampled

374
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,320
correlations for computed for two

375
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,079
related keys k and k plus delta are not

376
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,680
statistically independent

377
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,040
um we give an exact expression of the

378
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,279
variance of the sample correlation

379
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,880
difference without independence

380
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,079
assumption and in this way confirm and

381
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,760
generalize previous statistical

382
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,000
distributions of the correlation

383
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,720
difference used that have been used for

384
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,800
linear key recovery attacks

385
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,639
the main theorem

386
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,000
is

387
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,079
considers just a boolean function

388
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,079
because the linear approximation is just

389
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,079
the boolean function and define the

390
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,600
correlation in the usual way

391
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,480
and the sample correlation is the same

392
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,160
but compute

393
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,120
over only a sample of inputs

394
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,880
and then given a pair of boolean

395
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,320
functions f and f prime and computing we

396
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,160
denote the

397
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,360
difference of the correlations by c

398
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,760
and by c hat the difference of the

399
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,680
sampled correlations

400
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,839
and

401
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,279
then by q

402
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,040
the probability that f equals f prime so

403
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,199
this is something that we need to to

404
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,839
state the result of the theorem

405
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,600
which is that the

406
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,040
distribution of c hat is approximately

407
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,160
normal with mean c

408
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,959
and variance equal to

409
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:33,920
this

410
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,199
expression

411
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,880
where n is the size of the random sample

412
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,079
and b is the so-called

413
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,880
finite population correction coefficient

414
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,320
if the sample is drawn without

415
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,920
replacement and it's if we said put it

416
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,639
equal to one if the sample is drawn with

417
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,199
replacement

418
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,680
so assume moreover that over the related

419
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,240
function pairs we have

420
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,320
we have the c

421
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,480
the difference of the correlations

422
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,360
uh normally distributed from mu and

423
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,519
sigma squared

424
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,720
then the distribution of c hat

425
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,000
we can

426
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,240
give the integrated distribution over

427
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,720
the data samples and over related

428
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,360
function pairs

429
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,759
is approximately normal with mean equal

430
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,440
to mu

431
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,720
here and the variance equal to

432
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,040
this uh the

433
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,959
expression given here

434
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,079
where now q is the mean over over the

435
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,920
probability q

436
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,959
is the mean of q

437
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,720
the probability of q

438
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,880
probability q over the related function

439
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,199
pairs

440
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,800
so this is the main main

441
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,000
main

442
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,600
result

443
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,800
this

444
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,199
formula doesn't appear this expression

445
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,360
doesn't appear in the paper it's in the

446
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,880
recorded presentation though

447
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,959
but we give the in the paper we have

448
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,599
these applications if the sign for

449
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,880
example

450
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,919
on the

451
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,039

454
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,880
um

455
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,359
given by bogdanov and others in 2013

456
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,919
but the cipher the

457
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,079
for the cipher they

458
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,959
they're

459
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,559
but they

460
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,880
consider two ciphers l block and twine

461
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,840
where

462
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,280
these ciphers had the property that

463
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,480
there was a key difference that kept the

464
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,840
correlation invariant

465
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,760
under when you compute the correlation

466
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,280
of linear action

467
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,520
some some key difference and some linear

468
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,840
approximation where the correlations

469
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,679
were equal

470
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,320
so it means that the mu equals zero and

471
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,720
also the variance equal to zero because

472
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,960
they were all equal to zero

473
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,600
but for random we have mu equals 0 and

474
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,918
the variance is 2 to the 1 minus n

475
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,240
then

476
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,160
we can give the exact

477
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,840
i'll give the the distribution of c hat

478
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,080
it's normal with mean equal to zero and

479
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,919
various variants as given in this table

480
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,840
uh so with replay if sampling is with

481
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,000
replacement we have this variance

482
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,720
in the random case and for cipher we

483
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,480
have 2 over n

484
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
while with that replacement

485
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,840
we have this 2 over n for random

486
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,400
and for cipher something

487
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,280
less

488
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,760
so clearly because the variance for

489
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,640
cipher is less than for random we are

490
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,679
also here expecting to see

491
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,600
that for cipher the variances are

492
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,280
smaller

493
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,240
so the conclusion we just

494
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,840
consolidated

495
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,960
the statistical premises of related key

496
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,039
linear analysis

497
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,080
and we are looking forward to seeing new

498
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,880
applications of related key

499
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,880
linear group analysis thank you

500
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,080
thank you

501
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,799
are there any questions

502
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
so maybe i have one

503
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,520
um so

504
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,039
in the paper i think you say um you try

505
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,840
looking at the multiple linear case

506
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,240
and do you have idea of to deal with uh

507
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,600
with this and do you see uh any

508
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,199
any way to to solve this

509
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,280
yeah i mean

510
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,440
i think it can be solved but it's

511
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
it's going to be

512
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,840
it's quite complicated

513
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,559
i mean you have to consider over the

514
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,960
multi

515
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,840
multinomial

516
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,960
distribution and

517
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,720
now there will be

518
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,039
because now you have two functions

519
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,520
not just a single

520
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,720
variable but you have two variables and

521
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,360
they are joint multi

522
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,919
multinomial distribution

523
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,480
so it's quite complicated i haven't

524
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,600
tried

525
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
to do it

526
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,440
but but this is

527
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,400
for

528
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,159
for multiple linear cryptalises

529
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,720
assuming that the linear approximations

530
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,559
are independent

531
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,159
we can just use this result i just

532
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,880
showed to you

533
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,200
and for multi-dimensional linear

534
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,039
cryptanalysis

535
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,280
it's not that easy because you cannot

536
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,360
assume the linear approximations to be

537
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,880
independent

538
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,679
but in the random case

539
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,640
my guess is that they behave as if they

540
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,440
were random just

541
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,200
quite a

542
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,799
complicated

543
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,679
thing

544
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,880
to

545
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,559
show and

546
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,679
i believe

547
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,159
i don't think it's a

548
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,520
any

549
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,159
fundamental problem it just

550
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,240
takes a little bit time and work to do

551
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,760
it

552
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,200
okay thank you

553
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,360
is there any other question maybe online

554
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,919
okay if not let's uh thanks kaiser again

555
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,120
our next stock is also online it's

556
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,039
called towards kill query attack

557
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,120
friendly distinguisher application to

558
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,240
gift 1.8 and reason is giving the talk

559
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,120
and

560
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,479
can you try sharing please

561
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,399
so wait wait a minute sorry

562
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,360
yeah can you hear me and it's all see my

563
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,799
screen

564
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,120
yes can you be in a full screen mode

565
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,678
please okay

566
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,280
hello everyone

567
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,440
my presentation is about the paper

568
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,080
titled uh towards kill recovery attack

569
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,240
friendly distinguishers application to

570
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,760
given to each

571
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,760
my name is reason one it's my job to

572
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,240
work with

573
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,120
an allegiance

574
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,440
yeah as a motivation

575
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,679
when they amount to

576
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,600
or linear attack procedure

577
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,000
there are several steps we must

578
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,960
do the first is to find

579
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,679
some

580
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,760
wrong distinguisher for example with

581
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,720
input alpha and output value bet with

582
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,880
probability denoted by p

583
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,600
and the second step we extend run

584
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,280
function at the

585
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,520
top

586
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,000
at the top

587
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,720
and

588
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,120
from alpha and at the bottom from beta

589
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,280
then we check the immobile key base in

590
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,880
the extended rounds

591
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,760
and at last we collect enough messages

592
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,000
and use statistical methods finding the

593
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,440
relative value

594
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,400
so

595
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,240
we've found that the first number of

596
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
step is to search out some valid

597
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,400
distinguishers and

598
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,799
usually we do these steps as independent

599
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,720
steps the first is searching

600
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,039
distinguished and the second is attack

601
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,039
procedure

602
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,799
and the really uh

603
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,360
want to find the distinguisher we we we

604
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,840
really have two expedition first the

605
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,480
distinguisher uh should be long it means

606
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
that the function can be extending

607
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,840
the top and at the bottom of the

608
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,400
and second is low complexity

609
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,039
it means that remove mountain attack

610
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,120
less involved key bits should be in the

611
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,760
extend wrong function

612
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,279
we found that both

613
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,440
these two expectations i decided

614
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,679
completely by the distinguished input

615
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,200
and output value

616
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,400
uh a are from the better so

617
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,200
uh

618
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,760
in fact some distinguished advantages

619
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,000
when utilized to monitor recovery

620
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,400
attacks it means that for example there

621
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,559
are two distinguishers but they have

622
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,960
different input and open values then

623
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,720
when utilized to

624
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,840
monitor attacks these two distinguishers

625
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,200
can have

626
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,960
can lead to different

627
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,520
attack results

628
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,880
so we propose two set uh two step

629
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,440
steadily to search for uh distinguishers

630
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,000
the first one we specify the input and

631
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,559
of the values inside called the initial

632
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,080
initial side

633
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,279
and we want the values in the initial

634
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,320
satisfying about two expectations

635
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,880
morons can be extended from this input

636
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,600
and output values and second the amount

637
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,640
of involved keep it in in the extended

638
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,159
round is small

639
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,440
and second

640
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,760
we search for the voltages distinguished

641
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,240
with inputs and multiple values only

642
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,640
children from the initial set uh given

643
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,840
by the first step

644
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:45,840
so

645
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
on the emr paper uh

646
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,200
when

647
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,080
proceeding the the first step we use mrp

648
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,720
technique to search for the initial set

649
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,960
and actually uh uh

650
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,880
uh

651
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,120
researchers can use different techniques

652
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
to search for the initial set and here

653
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,919
is why we choose the mrp technical uh

654
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,080
first the searching space of this step

655
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,559
is very small and the number of extended

656
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,799
rounds is really small when compared

657
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,960
with the length of the distinguisher and

658
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,200
the second is the mrmp timing it's such

659
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,000
an efficient

660
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,080
and

661
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,600
at the mrp technical it uh already

662
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,559
values the uh when we want to

663
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,360
uh

664
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,480
uh

665
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,880
evaluate the security or some cipher so

666
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,440
we didn't give the details how we

667
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,679
control the the army model so

668
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,520
we come to uh the

669
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,240
result of the first step the initial set

670
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,960
then we successfully

671
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,600
started the mrp model and

672
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,520
get the initial set

673
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,039
using the uh

674
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,480
using the

675
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,400
the steps that described in the first

676
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,480
step we collect all values that can be

677
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,559
extended by most runs

678
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,120
and also with some small amount involved

679
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,679
key bits into a set for the initial set

680
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,000
so once a differential with this

681
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,720
input and output value uh differences is

682
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,159
formed we can monitor everything attack

683
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,799
the second step is the revisitive matrix

684
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,880
function bona algorithm and this

685
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,360
algorithm get granted to return all best

686
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,799
skills for any initial value so

687
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,360
we think that it is very suitable for

688
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,279
our second step

689
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,120
and also we

690
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,440
we have some dedicated settings the

691
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,919
first is only choose initial values from

692
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,399
the initial side for sure and the second

693
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,120
is set the upper bound of active x-boxes

694
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,919
in each round the function to be full

695
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,679
and the third is set at the lower bound

696
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,279
of the probability of validity

697
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,120
differential craft

698
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
resides to be

699
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,480
2-1 to 8.

700
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,880
and this is our such algorithm we have

701
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,960
three sub procedures the first one is

702
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,799
initial initialization it has uh the

703
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,880
dedicated settings described above in

704
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,799
the last slab and the procedure two it's

705
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,520
a

706
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,080
record server search is uh

707
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,480
it said the same as the

708
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,320
matrix already know such algorithm and

709
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,720
the last procedure three we record

710
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,760
qualified results

711
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,559
under and the uh this is our uh strategy

712
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,320
to search for different trails and when

713
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,559
we search for a linear field for uh get

714
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,919
one to eight

715
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,320
we use rit is the ability to describe

716
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,159
the linear mass propagation through the

717
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,720
sub cell operation

718
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
the the inequalities

719
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,760
concentrating is the same as uh in for

720
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,279
the differential trail

721
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,760
and due to the fact that the input of

722
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,320
the s both and the linear layer will

723
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,679
give to one visited where crafted resist

724
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,320
resist the linear crop analysis you can

725
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,039
not search out a long linear trials when

726
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,279
the upper bond of active exposing each

727
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,120
round

728
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,120
it should be less or equal to uh four

729
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,000
so we said t add five

730
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,279
and uh this is our result

731
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,399
uh we apply our strategy to analyze uh

732
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,399
gift one to each and a serve for both

733
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,919
differential and linear trios for linear

734
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,799
fields we found a 20 round differential

735
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,520
that can be used to attack a 27 round

736
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,279
gift one to it and this is the first 27

737
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,080
run attack on gift bank which cover one

738
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,520
more on than the other resource

739
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,600
uh and for

740
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,080
linear corporate analysis we found a

741
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
17-round linear hole and give the first

742
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,799
linear critically account um it went to

743
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,480
it which covers the 22 rounds

744
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
and we also monitor a linear crafting

745
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,039
analysis on the most two notable give

746
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,440
the beast proposed give cfp and it's

747
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,120
only gift for a given cofb we analyze

748
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,720
the security of its uh 15-round

749
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,360
version for sony gift we analyze the

750
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,919
security of its 16-run diversity

751
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,039
and here is my self-introduction

752
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,279
my research interests

753
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,720
mainly includes

754
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,960
symmetry cryptography hash functions and

755
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,840
ae

756
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,559
algorithm and no i work for high-tech

757
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,840
staff in

758
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,399
china thanks

759
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,120
thank you

760
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,240
okay

761
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,360
so i think we don't have much time for

762
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,279
our questions so we will

763
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,520
directly go for the next work

764
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,720
and so the knife talk is untitled

765
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,880
infrared rectangle attack comes crania's

766
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,720
craft and it's given by ocean magic

767
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,840
you

768
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,120
what's that matter

769
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,640
thanks for introduction hello everyone

770
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,039
again a new work another work regarding

771
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,480
boom ranking analysis and another two

772
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,919
concerning finding boomerang

773
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,559
distinguishers but maybe this one is a

774
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,120
little simpler to understand or follow

775
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,640
and maybe apply on other cyphers

776
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,399
this is the short introduction short

777
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,159
presentation of our paper entitled

778
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,679
improved rectangle attacks on skinny and

779
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,120
craft which is a joint working with my

780
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,799
honorable colleagues nasser barry and

781
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,279
lindsay

782
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,799
it doesn't work

783
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,919
the merit of our work is actually uh

784
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,600
introducing a new heuristic method to

785
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,320
search for sandwich distinguishers

786
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,880
and introducing new tools in visiting

787
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,480
frameworks using which we can formulate

788
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,880
dependency in multiple rounds

789
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,720
of homework switch we applied our method

790
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,559
and crafts and scenes as two sdm like

791
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,600
ciphers

792
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,919
and we managed to

793
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,159
significantly improve their sandwiches

794
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,799
signatures of this cyber

795
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,279
let me introduce our very briefly the

796
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,039
sandwich extinguisher

797
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,960
sandwich distinguisher was proposed by

798
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
dunkelman killer and shamir

799
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,080
uh and

800
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,919
it is actually um

801
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,360
proposed to

802
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,279
uh take the dependency between the upper

803
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,559
and lower differential transitions in

804
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,960
boom bank equipped analysis into account

805
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,760
as you can see in this shape

806
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,279
uh in sandwich extinguisher we cut the

807
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,919
voice cipher e into three smaller slices

808
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,360
such that there exists good differential

809
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,760
transitions for upper and for first and

810
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,880
last

811
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,159
slices

812
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,399
and these two slices can be connected to

813
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,120
each other by putting a small boomerang

814
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,080
uh distinguisher in b3

815
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,760
for example assume that there is a

816
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,039
differential

817
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:23,919
there there's a good differential

818
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,840
transition delta one to delta two for e

819
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,519
zero with role to p

820
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,720
and there is another differential

821
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,279
transition uh for example the noble tree

822
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,039
is noble four which was a queue for e1

823
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,000
um

824
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,600
to build the sandwich distinguisher in

825
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,880
practice

826
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,279
we start with two planets p1 and p2 with

827
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,200
different stilton one and we create the

828
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,960
encryption of these two plaintexts to

829
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,440
drive the ciphertext c1 and c2 then we

830
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,519
apply the difference knoblet 4 and the

831
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,200
derived cycle test to generate two new

832
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,679
ciphertests c3 and c4 and then we query

833
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,159
the decryption of these two cypher tests

834
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,080
to derive the corresponding plaintext on

835
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,440
the other side namely p3 and p4

836
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,200
and finally check the difference between

837
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,080
p3 and p4 to see whether the difference

838
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,679
between them is delta 1 or not

839
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,760
the probability of getting difference

840
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,520
delta 1 on the other side of this

841
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,359
distinguisher is ps squared t squared r

842
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,879
where r is actually the quality of

843
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,199
sending boom rank into the middle slice

844
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,719
and getting it back on the other side

845
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,918
with this brief introduction let's see

846
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,839
what's the probability of what's the

847
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,280
entire quality of sandisk do single

848
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,639
shares depends on

849
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,839
the entire quality of sandwich

850
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,199
distinction is ps squared q squared r

851
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,560
p is the

852
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,839
the probability of differential

853
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,079
transitions over the first part namely

854
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,399
e0 and it highly depends on the number

855
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,119
of active spaces over e0

856
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,399
q is also

857
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,000
depends on the number of active sources

858
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,159
or even

859
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,159
for r we

860
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,960
notice that it mostly depends on the

861
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,119
number of common active spices between

862
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,320
the upper and lower differential

863
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,079
transitions over the middle slice

864
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,640
and according to the ps4q squared our

865
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,960
formula we can see that the cost of

866
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,040
active spices over the outer parts is

867
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,560
higher than the cost of active expenses

868
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,480
in the middle

869
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,000
so with this introduction let me

870
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,520
introduce our new method to search for

871
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,240
sandwich extinguisher

872
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,000
our method includes three main steps in

873
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,160
the first steps we look for appropriate

874
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,319
upper and lower differential transitions

875
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,240
in which we aim at minimizing the number

876
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,079
of activist boxes

877
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,760
in outer parts as well as the common

878
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,839
active sources in the middle

879
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,760
next we instantiate the discover

880
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
truncated trades with concrete

881
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,359
differential trends and finally we

882
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,280
compute pq and r separately and put them

883
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,520
together in p p squared q squared r

884
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,000
formula to compute the entire quality of

885
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
sandwich distinguisher

886
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,599
let's take a look at the first part

887
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,520
which is the most important

888
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,440
phase of our method

889
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,280
in the first part

890
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,720
given a block cycle for e we divided

891
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,800
into three parts including e zero e m

892
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,640
and e one

893
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,720
then we input the propagation of

894
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,240
triangulated differential traits over

895
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,880
the first r zero plus r m rounds with an

896
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,280
mlp model

897
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,839
uh with a more based milq model we do

898
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:14,880
the same

899
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,520
for the less rm plus r variants

900
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,119
and make an independent military model

901
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,599
then to link these two independent

902
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,400
military models to each other and

903
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,320
in the common active spaces in the

904
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,359
middle

905
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,200
we define for every single spices in the

906
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,800
middle we define an additional variable

907
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,320
such as s here

908
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,839
and include three additional

909
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,359
inequalities

910
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,280
as you can see in the first slide into

911
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,040
our myp model

912
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,359
to connect the two mlp models to each

913
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,599
other and at the same time input the

914
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,520
active spaces in the middle

915
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,000
let's see how it works

916
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,240
according to these three inequalities

917
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,880
you can see that assuming that u

918
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,079
represents the activeness of uh nsbox

919
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,920
in the upper trail and l represents the

920
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,400
activeness in the lower trail

921
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,960
s is equal to one if and only if u and l

922
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,320
are both equal to one it means that s is

923
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,160
equal to one if and only if its

924
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,400
corresponding s box in the middle is

925
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,320
active in both upper and lower

926
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,800
differential traits using this way we

927
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,960
can include the

928
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,400
uh common accuracy in the middle

929
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,079
we also include an objection function

930
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,760
like this as you can see this objective

931
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
functions aims at minimizing the number

932
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,400
of axis boxes in outer parts as well as

933
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,680
the common activities boxes in the

934
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,720
middle

935
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,040
we also assign some weights

936
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,880
some appropriate weights to the active

937
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,800
spices in outer parts as well as them in

938
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,760
the middle

939
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,720
to

940
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,240
find appropriate

941
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,200
boomerang distinguishers

942
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,280
in the second step we instantiate the

943
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,040
discovered truncated trades with

944
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,960
concrete differential trades

945
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,760
however um it should be noted that our

946
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,920
distinguisher does not uh don't do not

947
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,880
rely on the differential characteristic

948
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,400
as you can see in this year we only fix

949
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,680
the differences at only four positions

950
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,359
uh which are the connecting point

951
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,280
between the three slices of sandwich

952
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,640
extinguishers as you can see

953
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,119
now let's take a look at the application

954
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,640
of our method our searching method for

955
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,720
sandwiches central and craft craft is a

956
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,240
light vector called by soccer which was

957
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,640
presented in fsg 2019 it's a very

958
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,800
interesting cipher it has a lot of

959
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,440
interesting properties for example all

960
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,040
of its building block in its round

961
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,960
function are involutary i skip its

962
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,280
description and i just show the result

963
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,040
of our searching method for main

964
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,520
distinguishers for craft

965
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,079
this table summarizes our

966
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,240
sandwich signatures for crafts all of

967
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,839
the probabilities marked in red have

968
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,160
been experimentally verified

969
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,760
as you can see in comparison to the for

970
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,520
example c simple differential analysis

971
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,760
uh boom rank distinguishes in the single

972
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,240
tweak setting have a greater advantage

973
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,480
over differential capacitances in the

974
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,240
single figure setting for example let's

975
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,440
compare

976
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,920
our turnaround distinguisher with a

977
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,359
turnaround differential effect the

978
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,800
success probability of alternative

979
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,400
sandwich extinguisher is 2 minus 19.83

980
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,320
whereas the differential effect

981
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,960
for 10 rounds is 2 to the

982
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,720
minus 44.

983
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,720
the advantage is clear

984
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,240
you also apply there too on a skinny

985
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,520
which is another

986
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,960
lightweight we killed by cipher this

987
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,640
shape represents its

988
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,640
round function depending on the number

989
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,240
of involved two keys and the block size

990
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,760
it has main

991
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,720
it has six main variants we applied our

992
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,119
method on all of its six main variants

993
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,920
and this is our results uh on a skinny

994
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,520
as you can see in all cases we managed

995
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,760
to improve the sandwiches signature by

996
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,839
one or two rounds for example let's take

997
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,920
a look at the

998
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,880
yeah

999
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
this one we managed to improve the

1000
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,240
success probability by a factor of two

1001
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,560
to thirty seven

1002
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,400
we also built kirikori attacks upon our

1003
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,079
discovered sandwich extinguishers and

1004
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,320
this table summarizes our results in

1005
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,400
queue recovery attack the top of this

1006
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,000
table represents our results and the

1007
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,400
bottom represents the previous results

1008
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,160
in all cases we managed to improve the

1009
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,480
rectangle attacks by one or two rounds

1010
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,400
except for one case which is this one

1011
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,640
however we could

1012
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,240
improve the its time and memory

1013
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,640
complexity in with every in comparison

1014
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,400
to the previous work

1015
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,240
now we come to the end of this talk when

1016
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,560
i would like to summarize our

1017
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,079
main contribution in this work we

1018
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,520
introduced a new heuristic method to

1019
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,040
search for sandwich distinguishers we

1020
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,200
also introduced new tools invisible

1021
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,680
frameworks that i didn't discuss about

1022
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,079
them in a short time but you can take

1023
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,240
more details in our paper

1024
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,760
we applied our method on two black

1025
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
ciphers the skinny and craft we

1026
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,200
which resulted in a significant

1027
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,640
improvement in rectangular attacks on

1028
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,760
this cipher

1029
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,599
all of our codes to reproduce the

1030
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,720
results

1031
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,040
and experimentally verify them are

1032
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,200
publicly available in this github

1033
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,960
repository

1034
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,160
and thank you for your attention

1035
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,040
oh we are

1036
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,720
a bit in a hurry so i think we will keep

1037
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,520
the question for this afternoon right

1038
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,599
okay thank you

1039
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,839
um

1040
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,480
okay

1041
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,359
so

1042
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,079
our next talk is untitled accelerating

1043
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,839
the search of differential and nila

1044
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,240
characteristic with the set method and

1045
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,960
lingsang is giving the talk

1046
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,440
and this is a joint work with wang and

1047
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,319
making one

1048
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,640
thank you for the introduction can you

1049
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,400
see my screen

1050
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,480
yes it's all perfect thank you

1051
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,800
okay thank you

1052
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,400
also

1053
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,680
let's start

1054
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,960
uh in the last decade the introduction

1055
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,920
of the automatic search goes to the

1056
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,160
correct analysis of symmetrical

1057
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,680
primitives to some degree however

1058
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,240
the performance of the automatic search

1059
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,400
is not always satisfactory

1060
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,119
for the search of long trials or suffer

1061
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,680
with large state sizes

1062
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,400
compared with the extensive attention on

1063
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,200
the enhancement for the search with nlp

1064
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,920
method field works care for the

1065
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,240
acceleration of the automatic search

1066
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,560
with set or smt

1067
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,280
so this paper is motivated by this

1068
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,040
vacancy

1069
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,200
the contribution can be divided into

1070
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,319
four parts firstly they propose a normal

1071
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,480
method to encode message bounding

1072
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,000
conditions

1073
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,480
following that they provide a direction

1074
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,560
for the selection of the bonding

1075
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,839
condition then with the new methods they

1076
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,319
obtain complete fonts about differential

1077
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,720
and linear characteristics of multiple

1078
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,000
servers

1079
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,640
the first one is we give a relatively

1080
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,359
differential attack on 26th round give

1081
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,240
to 64.

1082
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,720
partial classes you know saying a

1083
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,640
formula regarding the search of

1084
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,200
differential or linear distinguishers

1085
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,240
should characterize the random feature

1086
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,200
of the trio according to the specific

1087
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,760
goal we should restrict the number of

1088
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,040
active

1089
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,920
x-boxes the differential probability of

1090
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,599
the linear correlation in the

1091
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,839
distinguishable searching problem

1092
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,400
all these kinds of constraints can be

1093
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,200
abstracted as the boolean cardinality

1094
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,000
constraint and this constraint can be

1095
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,800
converted into ci formulas with the

1096
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,440
sequential encoding method

1097
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,560
in this method about unmultiplied key

1098
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,520
auxiliary variables should be introduced

1099
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,800
and the number of clauses is also about

1100
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,079
the multiply key

1101
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,040
we note that the sequential encoding

1102
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,440
method is based on the sequential

1103
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,480
counter circuit and the circuit computes

1104
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,200
the partial sum for increasing the value

1105
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,720
of i from 0 to n minus 2.

1106
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,920
the partial sum as i is represented with

1107
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,680
k boolean variables under the unitary

1108
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,240
system

1109
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,640
with a careful study

1110
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,800
we give two observations on the

1111
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,520
auxiliary variables in the circuit and

1112
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,640
these are

1113
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,359
observations are used in the encoding of

1114
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,119
the bounding condition

1115
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,319
firstly the circuit already computes the

1116
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,440
partial sum of x with the index starting

1117
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,640
from zero secondly the sequence of the

1118
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,520
partial sum is non-decreasing

1119
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,319
and after abstracting the

1120
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:41,040
bounding condition into the partial sum

1121
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,839
of the original objective function we

1122
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,000
partition the discussion into three

1123
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,200
cases

1124
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,440
uh in each case

1125
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,319
we

1126
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,640
with the circuit of the original

1127
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,680
objective function we can establish the

1128
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,040
constraint on the partial sum

1129
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,960
note that the constraint can be

1130
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,160
converted into boolean equation in cf

1131
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,200
and we realize the closer encoding for

1132
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,359
the bonding condition

1133
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,240
the advantage of this encoding method is

1134
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,040
we do not plan new variables and the

1135
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,480
number of clauses is reduced

1136
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,560
now since we generalize the bounding

1137
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,079
condition we can create cr2 minus 1

1138
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,200
bonding conditions so the problem is

1139
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,920
which sets of bonding conditions

1140
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,720
potentially resulting extraordinary

1141
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,480
advances

1142
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,520
to answer this question we set up a

1143
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,599
series of tests on gift 64 and summarize

1144
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,319
the strategy on how to select select

1145
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,440
success or funding conditions

1146
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,800
according to a considerable amount of

1147
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,480
experiments for

1148
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,760
different primitives and our experience

1149
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,079
these strategies can be generally

1150
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,960
applied to various block ciphers even

1151
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,520
though they are expanded with the tests

1152
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,880
on gift 64.

1153
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,599
the new method is

1154
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,720
applied to several block ciphers for

1155
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,720
present give the 64 rectangle outlaw can

1156
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,839
turn we obtain full information about

1157
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:25,680
differential active xbox differential

1158
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,800
probability linear active xbox and

1159
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,960
linear correlation

1160
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,680
as far as we know we are the first one

1161
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,400
to provide all these results

1162
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,839
compared to the runtime with the mlt the

1163
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,720
new method achieves significant

1164
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,439
improvements

1165
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,960
for all versions in the simon family of

1166
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,440
block ciphers they obtain the full

1167
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,839
learning of differential probability and

1168
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:54,839
linear

1169
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,319
correlation they claim that the result

1170
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,920
of the linear correlation is heuristic

1171
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,079
the acceleration method is also

1172
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,560
practiced on all versions of slack

1173
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,640
family of blood savers

1174
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,760
and our research reached the maximum

1175
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,560
length of differential and linear trials

1176
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,200
among all measures targeting the optimal

1177
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,680
trial

1178
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,480
we also use the acceleration method to

1179
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,960
evaluate the cipher with a 128 bit block

1180
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,000
size

1181
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,319
give them 128

1182
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,359
we get complete knowledge of active s

1183
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,960
boxes from one run to 14 round

1184
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,599
forte rounds moreover

1185
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,160
they destroyed we discovered the optimal

1186
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,280
differential trills for up to 20 neurons

1187
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,240
and the optimal linear characteristics

1188
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,880
for up to 25 rounds

1189
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,920
we also note that the the acceleration

1190
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,119
method also can be utilized to speed up

1191
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,359
the search of related k differential

1192
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,440
characteristics

1193
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,880
with this method for gift 64 they

1194
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,280
discover an 18 round related k

1195
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,480
differential trio with probability 2 to

1196
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,960
the minors 58

1197
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,680
and with the 18 round distinguisher will

1198
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,000
launch a relatively differential attack

1199
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,160
on 26th round gift 64.

1200
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,200
lastly we know that our result is far

1201
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,640
from threatening the security of gift 64

1202
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,599
since the authors recommended users to

1203
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,680
double the number of rounds under the

1204
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,920
related k attack setting

1205
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,839
and that's all for the presentation

1206
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,319
thank you for your attention

1207
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,800
thank you very much

1208
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,119
again i think we will uh

1209
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,839
directly jump to the next slide next to

1210
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,680
talk sorry

1211
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,319
um so the next talk is a boomer young

1212
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,079
embedding yoyo with boomerang and its

1213
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,160
application to kill korea attack on aes

1214
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,359
and focus

1215
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,280
and mustafiza rahman is giving the talk

1216
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,960
can you please share your screen your

1217
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,599
screen please

1218
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,559
okay thank you

1219
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,559
we don't hear you can you try to talk

1220
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,720
am i audible no

1221
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,559
yeah it's all good thank you you can

1222
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,880
start

1223
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,040
so this is a short talk on bumion

1224
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,079
so this work is based on

1225
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,160
basically two different uh fifteenth

1226
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,920
techniques which are almost introduced

1227
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,440
20 years apart

1228
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,800
so first one is the boomerang attack

1229
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,040
which was used in 1999 and another one

1230
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,119
is the yo attack on espn cyprus which

1231
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,640
was introduced in 2017.

1232
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,800
so here we saw the uh sorry sorry

1233
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,640
can you put you in first screen please

1234
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,559
full screen

1235
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,119
yeah this is full screen actually is my

1236
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,200
skin not visible

1237
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,880
because we don't see the bottom of the

1238
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,119
slide

1239
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,800
this is demand have you shared the

1240
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
entire screen not only the window you

1241
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,640
should share that

1242
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,559
share the entire screen because the full

1243
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,319
screen will be a different window share

1244
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,960
the entire screen

1245
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,240
is it let me try to no now go to view

1246
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,400
now put it in full screen put it in full

1247
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,760
screen now

1248
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,200
you must go to presentation mode

1249
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,440
go to view

1250
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,319
view on the top

1251
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:08,960
on your pdf

1252
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,240
left

1253
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,200
it's written view

1254
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,000
on the left of your on top of your pdf

1255
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,720
left

1256
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,160
yes

1257
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,558
and choose

1258
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,040
uh view mode probably

1259
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,960
probably i will just give it in this way

1260
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,520
and

1261
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,200
is it visible

1262
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,040
okay it's not too natural let's try like

1263
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,800
this yeah yeah

1264
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,920
okay

1265
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,200
so

1266
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,960
so in the left we saw the framework for

1267
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,640
the yo attack and on the right you saw

1268
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,400
the framework for the woman attack and

1269
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,040
eo is more related to the patterns

1270
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,040
instead of actual differences whereas

1271
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,960
momentum is more related to the actual

1272
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,160
differences

1273
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,559
and this is quite a deterministic one

1274
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,240
and this is uh more of a kind of

1275
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,240
positive but yeah some difficulty

1276
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,119
versions are also available there

1277
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,359
so our first result is that

1278
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,440
uh the whatsapp operation that occurs in

1279
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,480
the your attack can be realized uh as a

1280
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,240
combination of the ladder switch and the

1281
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,400
xbox switch so the ladder switch and

1282
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,319
xbox switch are actually

1283
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,359
a special uh monstrosity in the booming

1284
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:22,160
attack where they

1285
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,000
catches the dependency between the upper

1286
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,839
tail and the lower tail of the dominant

1287
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,160
curves

1288
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,720
so by really in the what's operation as

1289
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,280
a combination of ladder switch

1290
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,200
s-box switch we now construct the

1291
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,079
framework for the moving attack so in

1292
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,839
the upper part uh this is the part of

1293
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:42,160
the eoa part and in the lower part this

1294
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,880
is the part from the yo attack

1295
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,040
sorry from the boomerang attack so here

1296
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,760
we go give the probability of p

1297
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,359
and here we need to play the probability

1298
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:52,800
of q square

1299
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,720
and if the whatsapp operation occurs

1300
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,079
here then we get this alpha dash with

1301
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,400
probability one where the zero

1302
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,079
difference pattern for alpha and alpha

1303
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,079
test should be equal

1304
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,520
so this actually includes the

1305
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,480
probability to pq square

1306
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,480
so we applied this technique to mount

1307
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,319
key recovery attacks on five round and

1308
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,800
six round aes and additionally we also

1309
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,640
saw an application on

1310
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,598
10 round focus

1311
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,240
so to mount the attack on five round aes

1312
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,839
first we need to construct the upper

1313
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,359
trail and the lower trail

1314
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,400
so we observed that if this if these are

1315
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,599
two aes states and if these six bytes

1316
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,079
are equal for these two itself states

1317
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,440
then

1318
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,920
the columns of operation here can be

1319
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,359
considered as the

1320
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,520
inverse diagonal swap and this result is

1321
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,960
actually derived from

1322
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,960
special cases for the theorem five and

1323
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,040
three and six from this paper the

1324
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,559
exchange attack paper which is you know

1325
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,839
in executive 2019

1326
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,040
so when this actually uh these six bytes

1327
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,460
are

1328
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,800
[Music]

1329
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,960
inactive then

1330
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,960
what we do if we

1331
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,160
choose the

1332
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,400
lower trail as this part

1333
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,720
so if we are exchanging here the inverse

1334
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,720
diagram between the two cipher text so

1335
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,480
this essentially means that

1336
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,319
we are actually exchanging here this

1337
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:16,880
column and as these three bytes are

1338
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,599
in are equal for two different plain

1339
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:20,559
text

1340
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,040
so this essentially means that we are

1341
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,040
actually in swapping the inverse

1342
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,079
diagonal

1343
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,800
so as our upper part is sls layer here

1344
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,440
so the eo attack occurs in this upper

1345
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,559
part deterministically

1346
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,160
and then we get a pair of plain text

1347
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,839
and whose zero difference pattern should

1348
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,279
be equal to that of alpha

1349
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,319
next we extend this attack to

1350
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,640
mount a kilogram to convert this to a

1351
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,119
periodic attack for the sixth round aes

1352
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,760
for this part we prepared here one round

1353
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,040
in the beginning

1354
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,760
so we here we choose the difference in

1355
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,119
this form

1356
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,079
uh and we expect that here one byte will

1357
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,559
be active with this probability and from

1358
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,000
here we

1359
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,799
employ the boom young technique

1360
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,799
and here with some probability with this

1361
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,200
priority this byte will be inactive and

1362
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,839
thus in the end we'll

1363
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,000
receive this sphere and this kind of

1364
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,960
pairs with this cumulative probability

1365
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,079
now

1366
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,040
the problem here is that

1367
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,440
in addition to the right pairs here we

1368
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,079
also can obtain the wrong pairs

1369
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,599
and

1370
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,079
the righteous and wrong pairs uh both

1371
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,000
will suggest some pool of right and

1372
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,960
wrong pairs the problem here comes uh to

1373
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,880
how to distinguish the right pairs from

1374
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,720
the right key candidates from the wrong

1375
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,760
pairs so for this purpose what it did we

1376
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,960
use the notion of signals to noise ratio

1377
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,200
and we found out that for

1378
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,160
aes

1379
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,799
if we consider 10 right pairs then we

1380
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:59,119
can successfully

1381
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,720
filter out the right key candidate from

1382
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,960
the wrong key candidate for a for a

1383
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,319
column for a column base

1384
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,119
so in and now we

1385
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,040
use the same technique to mount key

1386
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,520
recovery attack on 10 round focus and

1387
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,640
this technique is quite similar to the

1388
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,559
attack that was mounted on

1389
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,319
six round aes

1390
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,640
and in this case we found out that uh

1391
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,119
two right pairs are enough for detecting

1392
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,160
the righty candidate

1393
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,040
these are the attacks and with the

1394
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,720
complexities that has been reported in

1395
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,079
this work

1396
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,240
and

1397
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,839
so finally we have uh we have devised a

1398
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,160
new genetic strategy

1399
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,079
which has combined the yo with the

1400
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,119
boomerang attack and uh

1401
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,640
we have shown that the watts operation

1402
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,559
can be considered as the combination of

1403
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,559
the xbox switch on the ladder switch and

1404
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,000
we have applied this technique to mount

1405
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,160
key recovery attacks on five round and

1406
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,559
six round aes and 10 round folk cost

1407
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,280
and the attacks on the aes has been

1408
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,680
verified by employing them on the 64-bit

1409
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,680
version of the aes

1410
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,599
and we hope that this provides a better

1411
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,359
understanding for es and aes like

1412
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,119
cyphers

1413
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:13,839
thank you

1414
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,839
maybe we have time for a quick question

1415
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:25,480
before lunch break

1416
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,440
so maybe i have one and

1417
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,839
do you think it would be possible to

1418
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,079
do automatically the search of such a

1419
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,880
distinguisher

1420
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,799
i didn't get you

1421
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,720
do you think it is possible

1422
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,040
yeah do you think it is possible to

1423
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,400
automatically

1424
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,799
automatically search

1425
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,440
for such distinguisher

1426
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,400
uh yeah i think it may be possible but

1427
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,400
uh

1428
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,240
actually we have think about that but uh

1429
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,440
still

1430
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,920
we are not able to do it but we think

1431
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,400
that may be quite possible

1432
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,480
okay thank you let's thanks all the

1433
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,890
speaker of this session again

1434
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,000
[Applause]

1435
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,880
you
