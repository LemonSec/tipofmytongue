00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,759
hi my name is tuger thiessen and i would

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,680
like to present to you the research that

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,800
andreas brazen kilmosa and i did that

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,120
resulted in the publication named a

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,880
formal analysis of boomerang

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,400
probabilities

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,480
for this presentation i will stick to a

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,480
high level overview for details and

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,680
references please check out the paper

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,039
we will start by looking at the

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,640
independence assumptions made in

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,199
boomerang attacks

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,800
and how making these assumptions can

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,120
lead to some surprising results

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,880
we will then give a high level overview

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,520
of the model we created to formulate a

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,440
boomerang formulate boomerang

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,280
probabilities without relying on these

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,640
independence assumptions

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,480
as well as well as some of the results

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,800
we were able to prove in this model

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,879
finally we will take a brief look at how

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,480
the probability estimates of some

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,719
classical boomerang attacks change when

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,760
re-evaluated in this model

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,440
let us start with a description of the

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,520
object of our interest the boomerang

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,480
attack

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,319
the boomerang attack is a cryptanalytic

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,119
technique invented in 1999 by david

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,280
wagner in particular to break the block

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,080
cipher coconut 98 but more generally to

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,240
disprove the idea that the absence of

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,400
high probability differentials implies

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,000
security against differential

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,600
cryptanalysis

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,759
the basic idea of the boomerang attack

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,840
is to connect two differentials that

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,240
each cover one part of the cipher one

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,720
for the top part one for the bottom part

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,880
to create a differential structure that

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,360
covers the entire cipher

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,880
we assume that we can split the block

44
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,000
cipher into two parts a top part e0 and

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
the bottom part e1

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,200
and that we have a sufficiently good

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,600
differential for each part

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,840
the first differential over the top part

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,680
maps a difference alpha to a difference

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,680
beta with probability p

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,360
while the second differential maps a

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,439
difference gamma to a difference delta

53
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,040
over the bottom part with probability q

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,119
to create the simplest type of boomerang

55
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,520
distinguisher we start with a pair of

56
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,320
plain text x0 and x1 that have a

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
difference of alpha

58
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,680
because of the first differential we now

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
expect this pair to be mapped to a

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,120
difference beta after e0 with

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,959
probability p

62
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,080
the corresponding intermediate states y0

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,000
and y1 are then mapped to the

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,959
ciphertexts z0 and z1 by e1

65
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,319
we now construct two new ciphertexts z2

66
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,760
and z3

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,920
by adding the difference delta from the

68
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,519
second differential to each of the

69
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,200
ciphertexts

70
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,840
and asking for the

71
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,280
decryption when the two new ciphertexts

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,000
are now decrypted over e1 we expect the

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,239
two delta differences to be mapped to

74
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,560
gamma difference differences

75
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,120
each with a probability of q according

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,760
to our second differential

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,360
this forces the difference between the

78
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,239
corresponding intermediate texts y2 and

79
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,360
y3 to be beta

80
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
now we expect this beta difference to be

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,040
mapped to a difference alpha in the

82
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
corresponding plane texts with

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,360
probability p

84
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,720
in summary

85
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
when we encrypt a pair with difference

86
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,760
alpha

87
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,959
then construct a new pair of ciphertexts

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,640
by adding a difference delta to each

89
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,080
ciphertext

90
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,519
and then asking for the decryption of

91
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,760
those ciphertexts we expect the

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,840
resulting plaintext to have a difference

93
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,239
alpha just like the initial pair with a

94
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,599
probability of p squared times q squared

95
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,040
a structure like this is called a

96
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,120
boomerang distinguisher and we call the

97
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,040
probability to detect the difference

98
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,440
alpha again in the second plaintext pair

99
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,799
the probability of the boomerang

100
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,799
distinguisher

101
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,640
now when we just estimated the

102
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,920
probability of this bloomberg

103
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
distinguisher we made an implicit

104
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,360
assumption

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,040
namely that we can treat the four

106
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,440
involved differentials as independent

107
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,959
and thereby determine the overall

108
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,879
success probability as the product of

109
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,159
the four differential probabilities

110
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,680
while it is a standard assumption in

111
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,599
differential crypt analysis

112
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,040
to assume the independence of

113
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,640
differentials in different parts of the

114
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,720
cipher the assumption that we can treat

115
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
differentials in the same parts of the

116
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
cipher as independent is specific to

117
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,480
boomerang attacks

118
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,640
now the question is of course is this a

119
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,959
valid assumption

120
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,199
as it turns out this assumption does not

121
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,440
hold in general the most famous example

122
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,959
for this probably

123
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,800
is the publication the return of the

124
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,840
cryptographic boomerang by sean murphy

125
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,360
to add to the list of conflicting

126
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,960
statements that result from making this

127
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,720
independence assumptions we proved the

128
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,600
following theorem

129
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
if we assume that we can treat the

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
differentials in a boomerang

131
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,240
distinguisher as independent

132
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
then there exists for every boomerang

133
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,919
distinguisher like the one just

134
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,120
presented

135
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
a standard differential over the entire

136
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,840
block cipher with significantly higher

137
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,639
probability than the boomerang

138
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,120
this stands of course in contrast with

139
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,560
the entire idea of a boomerang

140
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,000
distinguisher

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,280
i want to stress here that we don't

142
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,919
believe that this is to be true

143
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,520
but this is an indication of how

144
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,199
troublesome these independence

145
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,080
assumptions are

146
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,360
this leads us to the main question a

147
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,280
question in our research

148
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,600
can we formalize a model in which we can

149
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,000
state boomerang probabilities without

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,600
relying on these independence

151
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,160
assumptions

152
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,759
as a starting point we looked at the

153
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,280
standard model used to calculate

154
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,919
differential probabilities

155
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,600
to be able to calculate probabilities of

156
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
differential characteristics or trails

157
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,000
efficiently we want to treat rounds as

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
independent thereby allowing us to

159
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,639
determine the trailed probability as the

160
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,919
product of the round transition

161
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,680
probabilities

162
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
to model this we assume that for each

163
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,759
pair of texts

164
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,160
a uniformly random vector is added onto

165
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,800
the state before every round

166
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,639
a result of this

167
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,560
is that we no longer need to deal with

168
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,120
passive texts but only with a difference

169
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,759
now in boomerang attacks we don't deal

170
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,400
with pairs of texts but with quartets or

171
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,479
four tuples of texts

172
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,160
but apart from that we are able to apply

173
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,520
the same method of modeling the

174
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,440
probabilities

175
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,520
in our model we thus assume that for

176
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,319
each four tuple of texts a uniformly

177
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,400
random vector is added onto the state

178
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,800
before every round

179
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,560
a result of this is that we are no

180
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,479
longer interested in the exact values in

181
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,960
the 4 tuple but only in their relative

182
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,280
differences

183
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,000
take for example this 4 tuple of texts

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,440
x0 to x3 the intermediate differences

185
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,360
are uniquely determined by stating the

186
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,840
differences that the last three texts

187
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,919
have with the first text

188
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,000
we can thus describe the four table of

189
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,080
text x0 to x3

190
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,639
by the three differences delta 1 delta 2

191
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,520
and delta 3.

192
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
here we can see what our previously

193
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,160
discussed boomerang looks like from the

194
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,520
perspective

195
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,280
from this perspective and how we can

196
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,039
represent the different states in this

197
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,880
formalism

198
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,919
if you would like to see how to

199
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,599
precisely formulate the boomerang attack

200
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,560
in this model please check out the paper

201
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,000
here i would instead like to present

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,440
some of the statements that we are able

203
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,479
to prove in this model

204
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,880
the first one stands somewhat in

205
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,720
contrast to the strange theorem from

206
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,680
earlier

207
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
namely that the probability of a

208
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,039
boomerang with input difference alpha

209
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,919
and output difference beta is at least

210
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,759
at least as high as the corresponding

211
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,360
differential

212
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,840
another very interesting result is this

213
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,639
for two round boomerangs

214
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,680
on spns with four uniform s boxes the

215
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,759
probability deviates maximally from the

216
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,520
classical estimate

217
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,400
the probability is always p times q

218
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,199
or zero but never p squared times q

219
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,720
squared

220
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,199
a consequence is that one needs to be

221
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,240
careful

222
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,400
evaluating the probability of boomerang

223
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,960
attacks over such spns as they can

224
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,720
deviate strongly from the classical

225
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,840
estimate

226
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,960
we will look at some examples shortly

227
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,360
the last result i want to present here

228
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,199
is somewhat redeeming for the classical

229
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,879
boomerang estimate

230
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,599
the probability that two pairs of texts

231
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,919
follow the same trail is equal to the

232
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,759
classical estimate when averaged over

233
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,840
the separating distance

234
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,919
this has two consequences

235
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,440
the first is that the probability of a

236
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,840
boomerang distinguisher which is made up

237
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,520
of a large number of individual

238
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,840
boomerangs is likely to be close to the

239
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,520
classical estimate

240
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,599
the second consequence is that the

241
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,839
classical estimate should hold much

242
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,080
better for those parts of a boomerang

243
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,479
that are further away from the middle

244
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,399
where the separating distances are quite

245
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,039
restricted

246
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,200
to put this model to a test we

247
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
re-evaluated the probabilities of some

248
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,040
classical attacks on the block cipher

249
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,080
serpent

250
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,839
the first attack we looked at was the

251
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,760
amplified boomerang attack by kelsey

252
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,600
kono and shania

253
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,440
that attack uses a single boomerang

254
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,040
where the interior two rounds have a

255
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,760
probability of zero rendering the entire

256
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,959
boomerang distinguisher impossible

257
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,720
the second attack we looked at was the

258
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,040
rectangle attack on serpent by bihar

259
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,600
dunkelman and keller

260
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,240
that attack uses a more refined approach

261
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,080
where the distinguisher is made up of

262
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,480
two to the 53.3 individual boomerangs

263
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,800
evaluating the inner two rounds

264
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,360
of those boomerangs

265
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,240
revealed that only 972 of those have a

266
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,640
non-zero probability

267
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,200
interestingly though because these

268
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,279
boomerangs have a vastly higher

269
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,399
probability

270
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,360
than the classical estimate suggests

271
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,519
our estimate of the total probability of

272
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,680
the boomerang ends up being even higher

273
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,439
than the original classical estimate

274
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,839
to

275
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,399
summarize

276
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,720
to summarize we showed that a strange

277
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
result of the classical independence

278
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,760
assumption is

279
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,120
that it would make boomerangs

280
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,839
superfluous

281
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,519
we formalized the model for stating

282
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,440
boomerang probabilities that works

283
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,200
analogous to how standard differential

284
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
probabilities are determined

285
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,200
we proved how

286
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,680
we used this model to prove how how two

287
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,600
round boomerangs on spns with four

288
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,680
uniform s boxes deviate strongly from

289
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,320
the classical estimate

290
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
and we show that also the classic

291
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,560
estimate is adhered to on average by a

292
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,240
pair of texts

293
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,920
when averaged over the separating

294
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,360
distance

295
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,800
finally we re-evaluated the

296
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,480
probabilities of some classical

297
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,240
boomerang attacks using our model

298
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,970
thank you for listening
