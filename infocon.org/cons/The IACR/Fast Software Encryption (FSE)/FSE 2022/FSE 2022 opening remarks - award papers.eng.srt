1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
are connected abroad so

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,040
welcome to

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,519
so uh welcome all to fsc 2022 in athens

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,440
so i'm very glad to be here and that you

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,840
all here to present for this conference

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,520
because as you know this conference

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,240
has a kind of long long history so

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,320
probably not if you all of you are aware

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,480
so originally fsc in athens was planned

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,520
to take place in march 2020

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,680
uh so this basically means that the

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,440
bunker place or the venue place and

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,399
everything was already booked in 2018

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,360
so then time count of 7 years and

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,760
already like bought in 2019 that's why

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,800
you have a 2020 logo actually

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,039
on uh on your lanyards

18
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,199
and then even we open the registration

19
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,199
and actually some people registered and

20
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,199
had a lot of participants

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,719
until february

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,159
and then

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,438
you can

24
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,520
all know what happened right

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,240
so

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
we had to cancel the event but we said

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,200
okay

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,439
summer will arrive the virus virus does

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,520
not survive at two hot temperatures

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,759
especially at the temperatures so we

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,560
will just wait to die and then we have

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,799
fse again in november

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,720
so that was the plan

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,479
so we were thinking opening the

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,479
registration and then you also know what

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,479
happened so second wave

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,119
so we had to cancel it again we had it

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,360
in hybrid mode and then we kind of

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,680
gained a wisdom and said okay we will we

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,600
will wait to see what happens and we'll

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,479
try again in march 2022

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,439
so we are here today

43
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,119
and of course this conference would not

44
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,759
have been possible without the hard work

45
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,799
of the program chairs and editors of

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,439
tusk so i would like to thank some

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,680

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,240

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,920
at this episode

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,159
57 papers very good quality to be

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,680

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,479
into 10 different sessions so we also

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,120
have two very nice invited talks so i

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
talked by or dunkelman on tuesday and

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,319
another one by christina berger on

57
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,319
thursday

58
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,440
okay i will present you a little bit the

59
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,120
numbers of uh

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,440
of the participation so first i will

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,680
start for all the people that are abroad

62
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,440
that were not able to come physically to

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,640
efficacy and

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,280
are registered to us online so we have

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,400
in total

66
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,400
uh 112 participants so mostly regular

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,160
but also some students and they are

68
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,840
coming from 29 countries and as us not

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,800
surprising but you can see that uh

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,280
asian countries particularly uh

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,040
china and japan

72
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,120
are the countries with the most uh the

73
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,879
highest number of

74
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,920
uh

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,159
of attendees

76
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,760
so considering their own site

77
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,800
uh

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,560
so you'll see that

79
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
the room is kind of uh

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,560
it's not it's not any title there are a

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,080
lot of people here so we have in total

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,519
76 participants uh from 17 different

83
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,959
countries and actually also some

84
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,560
countries out of europe that is quite

85
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,760
surprising

86
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
and we're very happy about this so you

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,000
can see that the french delegation is

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,440
the biggest one

89
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,120
so we would like i would like specially

90
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
to thank them without them the room

91
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,120
would be much happier so they have their

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,480
proper logo for this

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,720
um

94
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480
of course we have to thank our our

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,360
sponsors uh so one silver sponsor the

96
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,120
tii and uh three normal sponsors that

97
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,959
helped a lot to take some of the

98
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,959
expenses

99
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,000

141
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,080
so we have also a small social event the

142
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,199
social event will be a visit of a guided

143
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,880
visit of the museum of ancient greek

144
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,120
technology this will take place on

145
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
wednesday afternoon and since the museum

146
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,759
is quite small we can go go there we

147
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,600
cannot go there all together so there

148
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,919
will be three groups uh one group from

149
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,840
three to four another one four to five

150
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,880
and last one from five to six local time

151
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,199
enter to know which group you are in

152
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,759
just look at your badge

153
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,120
and you have a small color so pink

154
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,960
color it means the first group

155
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,080
then a green color second group and blue

156
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,039
color it's a third group um

157
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,800
please do not you can change if you

158
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
wanted groups between them but the

159
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,759
number has to be constant that you can

160
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,840
basically exchange with someone else but

161
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,000
not decide by your own to go to a

162
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,840
different group because we don't have to

163
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,280
be more than 30 for each visit

164
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,880
so if you have some funny or interesting

165
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
on break or like the results you want to

166
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,720
make them know there will be a ram

167
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,800
session for this and uh crystal barley

168
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,720
and leo perhaps will be the the ram

169
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,360
session chairs so the information for

170
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,680

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,599
bottles so basically inside there is a

199
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,919
sweet liquor that's only produced in

200

201
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,520
greece that's called hills

202
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,319
um so what you got inside it's um it's

203
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,280
it is based on a resin that comes from a

204
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,759
tree that this tree is only planted on

205
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,520
this island heels

206
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,560
and

207
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,680
these bottles were ordered like in 2020

208
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,759
so they're waiting for your service so

209
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,840
please drink them at your own risk it

210
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,599
should be okay but well

211
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,520
i don't want to have the responsibility

212
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,840
for this

213
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,039
okay so for physical performances um if

214
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,400
you are presenting

215
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,080
please come and put your slides with a

216
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,240
usb to the conference computer it's not

217
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,000
possible to use your own computer

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,520
because we have everything the sound

219
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,440
everything that goes from here

220
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,760
um if you don't have a usb stick you can

221
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,039
also send

222
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,760
your emails to this address but please

223
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,919
do this not the last minute because it

224
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,360
will be complicated

225
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,200
uh so do not speak too close to the

226
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,959
microphone it's not right to true

227
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,560
anymore you can speak because the sound

228
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,000
is not that

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,320
high and of course be on time for your

230
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,360
session

231
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,040
another problem we have

232
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,240
at least for at least for today

233
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,120
is that we don't have a sound if you

234
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,640
speak from the audience who cannot hear

235
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,200
you so that means that if you are

236
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,040
talking and you have a question please

237
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,000
repeat it so people also can hear it we

238
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,360
hope to resolve this problem for

239
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,040
tomorrow but for today it's the best we

240
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,360
can do

241
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040

302
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,000

303
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,040
we have all together 57 papers to be

304

first session will be the next session

306
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,120
the award paper session and then we will

307
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,839
have

308
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,240
nine additional technical sessions and

309
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
then in addition to the technical

310
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,079
sessions we have uh

311
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,880
three so-called special sessions so we

312
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,399
have uh two uh invited talks the first

313
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,720
invited talk will be given uh

314
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
tomorrow on uh

315
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,200
by ordon command and the the second will

316
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,079
be given on thursday by a christian

317
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,399
rehnberger and

318
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,800
we will also of course uh have a rum

319
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,920
session on on wednesday as christina

320
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,120
mentioned

321
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,320
and uh

322
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,839
and besides that uh so in the afternoons

323
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,880
we will have a in-person workshop so

324
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,720
this will be a workshop

325
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,480
uh that is uh

326
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,160
basically will not be

327
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,519
live stream or recorded um

328
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,000
so it will be as i said

329
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,279
just for the

330
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,760
local attendees and the goal of this

331
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,120
workshop is basically to allow students

332
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,399
to present

333
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,720
the work from the last two years

334
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,680
and uh in uh you know in a convenient in

335
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,959
a comfortable manner

336
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,959
of course in person

337
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,839
and

338
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,240
by doing this we hope the to be able to

339
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,880
fill kind of a gap that was open

340
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
in the last two years by the pandemic

341
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,880
and uh

342
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,800
yeah so i hope it will be a very good

343
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,440
opportunity for the students uh you know

344
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,560
to to kind of see how how a standard

345
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,880
conference looked uh like two years ago

346
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,639
for those who did not have the

347
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,839
experience

348
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,320
and uh yeah basically i think that's all

349
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,160
i wanted to say and

350
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,320
yes i think we can start with the first

351
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,199
session that would be the award paper

352
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,199
session

353
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,360
this one works

354
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,399
um

355
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,839
um

356
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,359
you have muted yourself christine

357
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,639
we have to put some slides on so i like

358
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,880
slides are missing

359
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,639
so

360
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,720
or just

361
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,720
would you send it by email to me finally

362
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
i we don't see them on the usb stick so

363
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,399
that's sent them to me

364
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,480
if you can go to no because you have to

365
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,279
report it here

366
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,160
yes it's better

367
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,599
you are muted

368
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,040
um

369
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,360
so welcome to the first uh technical

370
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,519
session of this fsc

371
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,000
so it's a special session we will have

372
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
the all the papers that receive the best

373
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,800
paper award

374
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,519
and so we have three papers that will be

375
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,639
presented

376
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,920
and so the first one

377
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,679
it's called coaching the fastest

378
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,319
boomerangs and the obligation to skinny

379
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,640
uh so first congratulations for your

380
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,079
best paper

381
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,159
and i'll let you present the results

382
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,480
thank you very much for the introduction

383
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,199
i don't know can i make the talk in

384
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,480
french

385
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,360
since so many people are french yeah

386
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,480
okay so

387
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,080
let's go so this talk is about

388
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,360
something

389
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,600
christina

390
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,640
no this one didn't work the last oh okay

391
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,400
okay okay

392
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,000
i don't know why okay if we need to

393
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,160
yeah

394
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,480
well um

395
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,690
[Music]

396
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,600
okay so this one is about

397
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,160
the woman distinguishers which were

398
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,280
introduced by wagner in 99

399
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,440
and the main idea is to combine two

400
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,640
short differentials as it may lead to a

401
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,440
better probability than using only one

402
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,039
long differential

403
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,880
characteristics

404
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,720
to compute the probability of the

405
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,880
corresponding boomerang

406
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,360
we used to use an

407
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,280
independence assumption

408
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,600
and unfortunately this assumption does

409
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,200
not hold in practice

410
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,559
indeed

411
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,039
we found several examples of

412
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,960
non-returning boomerangs

413
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,400
and

414
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,919
the problems

415
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,840
occurred at the junction of both the

416
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,559
lower and the in the upper trace

417
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,960
so there were some attempts to refine

418
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,160
the probability of mourns for instance

419
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,120
the ladder switch or the sandwich

420
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,240
but in

421
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,000
2018

422
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,640
carlos sid and his quotas introduced the

423
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,840
boomerang connectivity table bct

424
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,160
which is mainly a unified view of all

425
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,559
the previous works and

426
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,480
which is a pre-computation

427
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,640
of all the possible boomerangs through

428
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,160
one single single s-box so you have the

429
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
formula

430
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,960
of uh of the obesity right here so it's

431
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,200
very close to

432
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,600
how we compute the ddt for instance for

433
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,240
oneness box

434
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,000
so originally to search for the best

435
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,559
boomerang distinguishers

436
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,679
against one given cipher the idea was to

437
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,280
first search for the best differential

438
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,960
characteristics on r1 runs to search for

439
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,880
the best differential characteristic on

440
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,080
earthworms and to combine them to obtain

441
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,559
an optimal boom wrong characteristics

442
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,760
characteristic on r1 plus returns

443
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,559
and

444
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,960
we were able to compute the

445
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,080
it's probability here

446
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,840
like like this

447
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,559
so this uh this process was optimal okay

448
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,320
because if you improve the probability

449
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,600
of one of the differential

450
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,679
characteristics you will

451
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,679
improve the probability of

452
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,919
of the corresponding

453
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,799
but now we know we have to refine the

454
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,080
probability

455
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,880
of of the boomerang many mainly because

456
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,080
of

457
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,880
of the middle rounds

458
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,760
and

459
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,159
actually the the process didn't change

460
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,679
change so much so

461
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,960
we are

462
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,039
still searching for best differential

463
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,919
characteristics we combine them and we

464
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,840
just refine the probability of the

465
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,159
corresponding compound the problem is

466
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,200
that this process is not optimal anymore

467
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,480
okay because

468
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
it is not true that the best

469
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,720
differential characteristics will lead

470
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,880
to the best boomerang distinct

471
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,120
non-distinguishers

472
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,520
so that was the starting point

473
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,360
of our work and our idea was to directly

474
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,280
search for boomerang

475
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
without searching for differential

476
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,799
characteristics

477
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,919
so

478
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,120
what we proposed was to use a three-step

479
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,799
approach

480
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,880
to a search for the best possible

481
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,280
boomerangs against against a block

482
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,120
cipher

483
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,760
so first

484
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,520
we propose a

485
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,720
milp model to search for truncated

486
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,679
boomerang distinguishers

487
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,200
then we

488
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,080
use a cp model so a constant programming

489
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,799
model to search for the best instant

490
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,559
sessions of

491
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,559
the previously found truncating boom on

492
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,200
characteristics so if we combine both

493
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,880
the first and the second steps we obtain

494
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,760
an algorithm to search for the best

495
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,919
boomerang characteristics against a

496
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,840
block cipher

497
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,600
and then we

498
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,080
added a third step to

499
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,360
evaluate more precisely the probability

500
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,240
of boomerang distinguishers by

501
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,480
computing cluster of boomerang

502
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,960
characteristics

503
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,000
so this work was applied to the black

504
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,960
cypher skinny but it is highly adaptable

505
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,559
to many other ciphers

506
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,760
so why skinny

507
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,320
first skinny is a very simple easy to

508
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,559
understand block cipher

509
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,080
and

510
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,280
all of

511
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,520
its internal components are very easy to

512
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,760
modalize so for instance the mixed

513
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,400
column matrix is a binary matrix which

514
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,919
simplifies a lot

515
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,480
the milp mobilization

516
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,159
similarly the tweaky schedule is linear

517
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,559
which also simplifies

518
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,559
all the models

519
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,799
and

520
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,440
the agility of the

521
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,799
skinny s-boxers are very interesting

522
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,240
regarding

523
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,159
differential

524
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,039
cryptanalysis techniques because

525
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,080
they contain a lot of different values

526
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,400
okay so searching for the best

527
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,559
differential characteristics against

528
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,080
skin is very interesting so it's the

529
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,760
same for for boomerang characteristics

530
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,320
so here are the results we found

531
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,559
for the block cipher skinny in the in

532
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,600
all the different versions

533
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,320
so as you can see we have found a lot of

534
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,880
newer distinguishers in

535
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,400
a lot of settings

536
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,120
and in particular we did improve all the

537
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,159
previous

538
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,279
results against this block cipher and

539
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,720
the most

540
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,120
interesting result is probably this one

541
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,240
because

542
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,240
for 18 rounds of skinny 128 in the tk2

543
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,440
setting

544
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,320
we did improve the probability of the

545
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,559
best woman distinguished by a factor to

546
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,720
the 30.

547
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,360
so that's all the results we found

548
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,240
with our approach

549
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,120
so how we did that

550
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,320
so first to search for the best woman

551
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,080
distinguishers we need to be able to

552
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,799
compute precisely the probability

553
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,760
of

554
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,120
of such things

555
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,000
and

556
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,159
to do that we need many differential

557
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,480
tables and the obesity is not enough

558
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,200
right so we had to use three more tables

559
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,840
the ubct for upper bct the lbct for

560
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,799
lower bct and the obesity for extended

561
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,240
bct

562
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,000
so they are all

563
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,480
particular cases

564
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,320
of boomerangs through one singular box

565
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,360
and they

566
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,120
all correspond to a one particular case

567
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,240
about which specif or which differences

568
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,159
are set to specific values and which

569
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,200
difference

570
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,559
says are

571
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,000
led free

572
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,520
are free

573
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,480
okay so the ubct and lbct were already

574
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,960
introduced in some previous works they

575
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,480
are also known as

576
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,919
bdt and bdt primes

577
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,720
while the ebct was

578
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,159
also introduced

579
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,120
in a previous work by um

580
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,000
miniet al about festel

581
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,799
boomerangs against festel cipher and it

582
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,039
was introduced as a future watch so

583
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,679
that's what we

584
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,840
so now given

585
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,720
for instance uh a woman characteristics

586
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,520
like

587
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,440
like this example here

588
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,520
it's very easy to compute his

589
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,039
probability

590
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,039
using all those

591
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,120
previously introduced tables

592
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,159
and also including the ddt

593
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,120
which i did not mention

594
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,320
so to compute the probability of a woman

595
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,880
characteristics all

596
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,159
we need

597
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,520
is to

598
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,360
know which differences are set to

599
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,679
specific values which differences are

600
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,440
set to zero and

601
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,720
which differences are free

602
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,320
so for instance

603
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,279
if

604
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,640
we look at this particular xbox for both

605
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,279
the lower and the upper side so here is

606
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,279
the upper trail and here is the lower

607
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,120
frame

608
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,400
in this particular case

609
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,799
for the upper trail

610
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,039
both the differences at the input and

611
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,200
output of the xbox are set to specific

612
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,480
values

613
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,640
while for the lower trail they are set

614
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,600
to zero and so in this

615
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,559
case

616
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,799
the table to use to compute the

617
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,279
probability is uh

618
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,960
it's only ddt d2 so we only have to

619
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,400
compute the probability of

620
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,880
the transition d to 2

621
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,640
through 1 s box

622
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,600
but if for instance we look at

623
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,840
at this particular s box as box so the

624
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,880
two two threes in that case we also set

625
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,120
to specific values

626
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,360
both the input and the output of the zx

627
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,559
box

628
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,159
on the upper trail but also

629
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,520
the

630
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,080
difference at the input of the s box in

631
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,520
the lower tray

632
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,919
so in this case it's uh

633
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,720
the ubct table which has to be used to

634
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,760
compute the probability of uh of this

635
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,120
particular part of the boomerang

636
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,120
characteristic

637
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,919
so

638
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,880
what is very important here is that

639
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,039
knowing which

640
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,440
differential table

641
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,600
has to be used in the

642
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
computation of the probability only

643
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,600
depends on

644
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,279
two specific

645
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,320
values so it depends on which

646
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,120
differences if the differences is set to

647
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,840
a specific value or not

648
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,720
and

649
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,399
it also depends

650
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,840
in the case that the

651
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
difference is set to specific values

652
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,840
whether it is zero or uh or not zero

653
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,960
okay

654
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,840
and

655
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,919
so

656
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,880
it allowed us to propose a

657
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,279
milp model to search for truncated the

658
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,600
boron characteristics

659
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,960
so the idea

660
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,799
is to

661
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,159
start from

662
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,159
milp model to search for differential

663
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,679
characteristics for truncated

664
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,200
differential characteristics on the

665
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
block cipher okay we have

666
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,440
many such mip models for many ciphers

667
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,240
and

668
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,720
for such model we typically have

669
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,919
variables

670
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,840
that tell us whether a variable is

671
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,600
active or inactive

672
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,640
and

673
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,200
what we did was to use what we proposed

674
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,360
is to use twice

675
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,799
such miap model one for the lower trail

676
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,159
and one for the upper plane

677
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,880
to add extra variables

678
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,440
into this model to

679
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,960
know whether

680
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,200
differences are set to specific values

681
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,640
or if they are left

682
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,880
and so of course we had some extra

683
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,360
constraints uh

684
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,799
about uh controlled variables and uh

685
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,440
and the relations between active and

686
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,200
control variables

687
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,840
we also had extra constraints related to

688
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,720
tables to know which tables are involved

689
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,039
in the computation of the probability of

690
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,039
a truncated difference of truncated

691
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,600
boomerang characteristics

692
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,640
and

693
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,120
otherwise it works exactly as

694
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,200
when we search for

695
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,039
truncated differential characteristics

696
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,320
so in truncated differential

697
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,000
characteristics we will search for we

698
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,039
will count the number of active boxes

699
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,120
and here it's exactly the same but we

700
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,799
will count the number of ddt of bct of

701
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,080
ebct

702
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,200
and and so on and the objective function

703
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,360
of the model is only a weighted sum of

704
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,520
this number of

705
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,760
tables which appear in the computation

706
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,600
of the probability okay and it's

707
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,080
weighted by the maximum probability

708
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,039
of

709
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:13,919
each

710
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,640
of those tables

711
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,399
one of the main advantage of this model

712
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,960
is that we don't have to introduce any

713
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,000
middle rounds for the boomerang okay

714
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,039
because

715
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,240
there are some attempts to search for

716
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,640
boomerang by dividing the cipher in

717
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,240
three parts and

718
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,799
to search for an optimal differential

719
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,720
characteristics in a

720
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,760
in one in in both

721
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,520
in two parts and to uh to add some bct

722
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,840
in the in the middle round

723
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,159
but here there is no need to define any

724
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,080
middle rounds and

725
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,399
actually our model automatically

726
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,320
switches to uh

727
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,559
differential characteristics to the

728
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,000
search of truncated differential

729
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,880
characteristics it means that after

730
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,799
if you

731
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,519
run it for

732
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,039
enough friends

733
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,200
it will automatically tell you that the

734
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,480
best

735
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,320
boomerang characteristics truncated

736
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,159
boomerang characteristics for this

737
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,840
number of fronts is to set one trace so

738
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,559
let's say the lower trade to only zero

739
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,360
so no difference in the lower tray

740
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,600
and only differences in the

741
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,760
upper tail which

742
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,159
it's completely equivalent to searching

743
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,720
for truncated differential characters

744
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,519
so

745
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,519
so that's our

746
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,880
milp model to search for

747
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,559
truncated woman characteristics

748
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,519
so we applied it to the block cipher

749
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,240
skinny but we did not did not apply it

750
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,360
directly so before that we made some

751
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,279
some simplifications

752
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,480
so

753
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
we noticed that

754
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,279
the maximum probability exponent of uh

755
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,440
many tables like the ddt obesity etc

756
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,000
were the same so we group all of them

757
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,360
into a one table which simplifies

758
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,159
the

759
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,720
the constraints and we also use the

760
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,519
queen microscopy algorithm to reduce

761
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,679
the number of inequalities of our model

762
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,720
and at the end we obtain

763
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,880
this table

764
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,320
okay which counts uh with it's uh counts

765
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,399
the number of active s boxes but like

766
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,640
the number of bct

767
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,360
ddt and so on and for instance how to

768
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,480
read it

769
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,360
so if we take this 40 here

770
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,440
it means that for 24 rounds of skinny in

771
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,399
the tk3 model

772
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,600
the best

773
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,480
boomerang characteristics

774
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,960
have probabilities at most to the minus

775
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,039
80.

776
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,519
so it's very similar to a

777
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,799
to a

778
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,880
truncated differential characteristics

779
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,600
to counting the number of active s boxes

780
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,840
and if you look at the

781
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,559
estia line

782
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,720
you will see that some of those values

783
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,679
are exactly the same as the one given by

784
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,080
skinnier designers

785
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,760
on the website and for the number of

786
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,159
activist boxes for truncated

787
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,720
differential characteristics

788
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:26,960
so

789
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,399
now that we have

790
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,799
many uh good

791
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,120
truncated boomerang characteristics the

792
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,240
goal is to

793
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,000
instantiate them and to find the best

794
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,120
possible

795
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,720
sessions

796
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,279
to do that we use

797
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,159
the

798
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,080
constraint programming model highly

799
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,919
inspirated from

800
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,240
another works we made with the

801
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,279
with the

802
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,679
other authors which were published at

803
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,080
acns 21

804
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,120
in which

805
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,919
we we found that a constraint program

806
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,159
programming model which must much be

807
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,159
better than a

808
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,240
milp model to

809
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,559
instantiate differential characteristics

810
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,000
truncated differential characteristics

811
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,480
so we use

812
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,199
essentially the same model to instant

813
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,359
boomerangs and

814
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,839
why it is

815
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,320
much faster than milp

816
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,639
i think it's because

817
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,679
the ddt is highly non-linear and

818
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,000
if you want to describe it using only

819
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,520
linear

820
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,918
inequalities it's very hard it's too

821
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,679
inefficient model

822
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,639
while

823
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,399
for constraint programming model you can

824
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,159
directly add

825
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,639
a constraint table

826
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,199
okay so basically for some variables you

827
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,800
will directly

828
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,960
tell the model that

829
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,879
all those tuples are

830
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,960
are possible and the other ones are

831
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,239
forbidden

832
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,520
okay so

833
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,960
that's uh but the model is very easy

834
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,839
and

835
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,640
so so we we run this model against many

836
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,359
of our truncated one characteristics and

837
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,599
so we were able to find

838
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,480
the best possible transactions of all of

839
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,760
them

840
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,320
and actually the model was

841
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,440
efficient enough enough so that we run

842
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,839
it

843
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,640
okay so

844
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,880
it was very fast so we were able to use

845
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,240
it to start looking for clusters so

846
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,880
basically we first search for all the

847
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,440
the optimal

848
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,599
boomerang characteristics and then we

849
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,880
search for

850
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,599
similar uh for for other woman

851
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,359
characteristics with the same difference

852
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,760
as the input output and the key okay so

853
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,160
we start clustering and for the best

854
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,880
best cluster at least the beginning of

855
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,400
clusters we found

856
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,119
we

857
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,599
performed the precis cluster analysis to

858
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,680
study precisely the

859
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,280
the probability of the corresponding

860
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,359
boom wrong distinguisher

861
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,359
and so basically from a woman

862
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,119
distinguished characteristics you can

863
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,160
erase all intermediate differences and

864
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,480
replace them by all the

865
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,320
variables that will be

866
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,400
involved if you want to compute the

867
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,480
probability of the boom distinguisher

868
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,160
unfortunately this

869
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,599
this probability

870
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,680
is very hard to compute okay there are a

871
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,960
lot of

872
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
internal variables so it's very hard to

873
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,280
compute directly so we first propose a

874
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,839
new algorithm to

875
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,880
reorder the formula so to uh to have the

876
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,000
depth of the formula as low as possible

877
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,680
but

878
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,760
it was not always enough and we had to

879
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,880
manually

880
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,119
approximate the formula in many cases

881
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,920
so here are the results and some of the

882
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,000
results were practical so we

883
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,480
experimentally verified the probability

884
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,000
of several of them so as you can see

885
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,160
for uh here for three of them it's very

886
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,880
close the the actual probability is very

887
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,280
close to the to the expected probability

888
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,160
but

889
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,800
sometimes there are

890
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,000
a gap

891
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,240
between the probabilities and we believe

892
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,320
this is because we only consider the

893
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,359
case where both sides of the boomerangs

894
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,760
follow the same differential

895
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,640
characteristics but it only they only

896
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,319
have to follow the same differential

897
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,200
so to conclude in this work we propose a

898
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,240
new uh

899
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,000
mil pcp uh adoc approach to search for

900
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
long distinguishables we found many

901
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,280
results against the block cipher skinny

902
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,079
but there are still some open questions

903
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,400
related to this work so first our milp

904
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,240
model generates a lot of redundant

905
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,320
solutions so solutions that would lead

906
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,079
to the same woman distinguishers

907
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,119
as i said we assume that each boomerang

908
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,240
follows the same differential

909
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,560
characteristics on both sides and we

910
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,800
still have to uh

911
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,520
to add some approximations

912
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,680
in the in the

913
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,680
computations of the probability

914
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,560
so the source code of uh

915
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,079
of all what we did is available at

916
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,960
this address and they are also a

917
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,119
pdf with all the figures of all the

918
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,760
boomerangs we are claiming the paper and

919
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,520
and feel free to send me an email if you

920
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,440
have troubles making the code work i

921
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
don't know okay thank you for your

922
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,440
attention

923
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:40,440
so other any questions first in the room

924
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,800
hi

925
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,960
uh thank you for this very intimidating

926
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,720
job it was really interesting

927
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,480
have you tried

928
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,200
to generate the big model for eight bits

929
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,920
playing cyphers

930
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,160
or other experience

931
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,000
i'll just repeat your question for some

932
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,640
people so the question was if they tried

933
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,520
uh

934
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,440
generates

935
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,160
the

936
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,920
models for 8-bit cycles

937
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,800
so

938
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,920
and and for any other rsbn cipher

939
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,160
no so i i don't really understand

940
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,040
because

941
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,359
for milp model it does not depend on the

942
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,839
size of the xbox okay because we applied

943
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,480
our milp model for skinny 128 which use

944
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,079
8b test box

945
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,599
so so

946
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,320
for

947
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,079
for this part it does not matter and for

948
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,400
the cpu model it works for both the

949
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,240
4-bit and 8-bit test box

950
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,640
now for the second part of the question

951
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,280
though we didn't try any ozone block

952
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,000
ciphers with this model i i know that

953
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,599
some people are i'm

954
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,800
looking at aes with this model

955
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,079
i don't know

956
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,359
okay

957
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,440
and i have a second question

958
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,480
uh you say you use the music and use the

959
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,720
queen not just here algorithms

960
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,119
university questions

961
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,520
so first which music model do you use a

962
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,880
music server

963
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,119
and also does the queen master just be

964
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,800
algorithmically

965
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,360
important complexity lanes

966
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,419
[Music]

967
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,720
okay so

968
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,960
the question was

969
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,839
about

970
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,800
the use of a queen musketeer algorithm

971
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,599
and

972
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,280
i don't remember the beginning of the

973
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,839
question but

974
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,200
how the name of the mip solver so so we

975
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,960
use the gurubi

976
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,839
for

977
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,640
mild solver and

978
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,960
okay for the quinmacross algorithm it

979
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,079
was only to reduce

980
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,040
the number of inequalities

981
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,839
related to

982
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,920
which table

983
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,800
has to be added into into the objective

984
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,160
function and actually it only saved like

985
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,200
three two uh twin equations of our two

986
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
inequalities over 15 or something like

987
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,720
that so it's not

988
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,040
a lot of improvement but since we added

989
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,079
we had to use it for a

990
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,280
large number of fronts i i think it's

991
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,000
still very interesting to use it

992
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,640
thank you very much

993
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,880
probably very last very quick question

994
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,520
from either remote on this no

995
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,240
okay so we can just thank patrick again

996
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,590
thank you very much

997
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:40,789
[Applause]

998
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,119
so what did you send the slides

999
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,160
to

1000
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,359
it

1001
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,880
so just take two minutes to

1002
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,240
to find in the slides

1003
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,960
yeah sorry

1004
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,160
uh i think it will sit there because

1005
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,079
so the second

1006
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,680
uh the second paper that received the

1007
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,440
best paper of words it's about the

1008
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,480
crypto analysis of low amc instances

1009
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,760
and uh

1010
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,160
so congratulations for your paper and

1011
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,280
cashier will present to this uh i said

1012
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,200
right yes the paper

1013
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,880
thank you

1014
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,040
thank you for the introduction uh

1015
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,720
excuse me you're still sharing the

1016
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,440
slides from the previous talk

1017
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,359
oh it's not sharing the screen okay

1018
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,839
resume sure

1019
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,640
no resume

1020
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,640
no

1021
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,920
is it good now

1022
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,960
yes

1023
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,880
okay so good morning everyone um

1024
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,560
okay the laser pointer i don't think

1025
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,960
it's working so i'm cashier from epfl

1026
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,800
and uh i'm here to present the joint

1027
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,119
fork with surety panic but

1028
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,000
in it

1029
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,240
called kryptonitis of low emc instances

1030
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,560
using single prentice ciphertext paper

1031
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,119
so okay first let's motivate the problem

1032
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,560
and see why do we care about single

1033
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,319
plaintext ciphertext

1034
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,280
uh cryptanalysis so it all goes back to

1035
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,960
a post quantum signature scheme called

1036
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,839
picnic so low mc is used as a backbone

1037
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:10,800
scheme

1038
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,000
as a backbone cipher in picnic so picnic

1039
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,800
is a pq signature scheme it's a special

1040
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,720
variant of z cable so z cable is a

1041
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,040
mpc and head paradigm type proof of

1042
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,960
identification that uses

1043
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,800
a transformation like fiat mirror or

1044
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,240
something

1045
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,479
yes

1046
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,839
really okay

1047
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,520
don't see

1048
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,480
okay can we check this

1049
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,640
here it's good for me this is just first

1050
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,879
page

1051
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,920
no idea okay

1052
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,400
this is just your first picture yeah can

1053
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,800
you try the second one okay

1054
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,880
do you see that

1055
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,040
okay

1056
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,319
okay where on the computer you mean

1057
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,480
yes

1058
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,680
okay

1059
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,480
okay this is really laggy okay

1060
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,520
so okay sorry for the

1061
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,200
thing that happened okay

1062
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,160
so the yes so

1063
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,160
as i said it's based on an npc and head

1064
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,680
paradigm and then

1065
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,440
currently is an alternate candidate in

1066
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,520
the third round of the nist pq

1067
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,440
standardization process

1068
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,079
okay so let's see how the mpc and

1069
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,400
the head paradigm works so i took a help

1070
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,599
from my co-authors so in an npc in head

1071
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,359
paradigm we have two parties let's say

1072
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,440
we have approver and a verifier

1073
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,560
and then

1074
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,960
my public key is going to be a cipher

1075
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,839
text a plain text and a description of a

1076
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,079
cypher you can think and my secret key

1077
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,680
is going to be

1078
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,760
the encryption key that encrypts that

1079
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,400
plain text into that cipher text and me

1080
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,920
as the approver i want to prove that i

1081
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,560
know that secret key so what i will do i

1082
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,079
will simulate an npc computation on that

1083
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,079
cipher and then commit to the

1084
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,760
computations that are done and send the

1085
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,960
commitments

1086
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,560
then the verifier will ask for some

1087
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,040
openings i will open and he will check

1088
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,680
local consistencies but okay this is not

1089
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,440
very important but the most important

1090
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,480
part is that

1091
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,720
my key consists of a single ciphertext

1092
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,079
and a plaintext

1093
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,000
so if i want to do a queue recovery on

1094
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
picnic by doing the key recovery on low

1095
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,079
mc i'm only given a single ciphertext

1096
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,839
and only one plaintext

1097
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,640
okay

1098
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,000
so okay

1099
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,640
as we know whenever we say the word mpc

1100
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,319
we don't like many multiplications

1101
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,800
because multiplications are very costly

1102
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,640
which means that

1103
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,359
if e has many multiplications then my

1104
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,960
whole signature scheme will be really

1105
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,920
slow

1106
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,720
that's why in most of these paradigms

1107
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,920
they use

1108
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,760
encryption schemes they use block

1109
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,960
ciphers

1110
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,160
that are

1111
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,319
that have really low multiplication debt

1112
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,960
and low mc is specifically designed for

1113
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,000
that

1114
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,359
so low mc is a really simple spn network

1115
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,400
uh proposed by albrecht catell

1116
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,559
it was designed specifically to be used

1117
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,839
for mpc computations on

1118
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,960
fhe so

1119
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,680
it has a really simple s box it's a

1120
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,839
three bit to three bit s box which you

1121
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,359
can see it written there it's a really

1122
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,599
simple quadratic function

1123
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:34,559
and

1124
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,480
later it's only followed by an affine

1125
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,800
layer and a key addition and

1126
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,319
the good point is

1127
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,400
okay so the good point is the s-box is

1128
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,040
the only non-linear part so because both

1129
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,520
key schedule are linear is a linear

1130
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,920
function and also the affine layer of

1131
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,160
course as the name suggests is linear so

1132
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,319
the only nonlinear part comes from the s

1133
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:55,440
box

1134
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,839
and then it's just a minor detail that

1135
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,359
there is a

1136
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,359
additional key addition in the first

1137
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,319
round

1138
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,280
okay so just let's set some notation so

1139
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,280
whenever i say s i would mean the number

1140
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,760
of s boxes that i have in round n is

1141
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,440
going to be my block size and r is going

1142
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,359
to be the number of rounds that i see

1143
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,160
you can see the circuit on the

1144
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,280
right side

1145
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,079
and you can notice that the domain of

1146
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,640
the s boxes are disjoint so there is not

1147
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,880
a single wire that goes into two s boxes

1148
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,480
at the same time

1149
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,400
and looking at that and knowing my s box

1150
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,079
is three bit to three bits i can see

1151
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:30,960
that

1152
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,280
three s should be less equal to n and

1153
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,640
whenever

1154
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,400
it's equal i will call it the full layer

1155
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,160
s box and whenever it's less i would

1156
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,160
call it a partial day

1157
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,040
okay

1158
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,280
so let's talk about some previous some

1159
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,119
prior work that was done before this

1160
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,119
paper was published there has been

1161
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,200
many other results

1162
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,240
after

1163
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,440
so it's so most famously i think we can

1164
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,599
refer to reichberger's attack from tosc

1165
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,880
2018

1166
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,079
which

1167
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,319
also was optimized at crypto 21 using

1168
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,559
some algebraic techniques but these

1169
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,880
attacks don't really apply to the picnic

1170
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,119
scenario and the reason is that both our

1171
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,680
difference enumeration type attacks

1172
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,599
and we don't have differences when we

1173
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,040
have only a single plaintext and cytotex

1174
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,839
okay so as i said these

1175
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,119
do not

1176
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,720
uh sit in the scenario that we have so

1177
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,040
one might say are we fine well not quite

1178
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,280
so let's talk about our attacks so in

1179
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,920
this work you propose two attacks one is

1180
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,640
a full that's a linearization attack and

1181
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,359
the other is a meet in the middle attack

1182
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,040
both of them use

1183
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,720
both of them are in the given ciphertext

1184
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,720
plaintext scenario and only use a single

1185
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,640
ciphertext plaintext pair

1186
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,480
both of them can break the full xbox

1187
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,880
variant up to two rounds and the partial

1188
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,880
xbox variant up to point eight and over

1189
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,240
restaurants

1190
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,599
so

1191
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,359
the linearization attack is actually

1192
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,359
faster although it's simpler

1193
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,599
but the good thing is we were able to

1194
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:00,880
improve the

1195
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,559
meet in the middle attack in some uh

1196
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,520
work that we did after to break more

1197
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,559
rounds

1198
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:09,920
okay and here you can see the

1199
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,839
complexities for instance if i have the

1200
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,920
full xbox variants 429 bits blocks

1201
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,400
the complexity of break units using the

1202
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,400
linearization is 2 to the power 91

1203
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,960
encryptions

1204
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,599
and also for the linearization

1205
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,240
you can see that it's 2 to the power 109

1206
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,359
okay

1207
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,920
okay so let's talk about the attacks so

1208
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,640
let's have a closer view at how the low

1209
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,680
mcs box operates low mcs box is written

1210
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,280
on the right as you see

1211
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,160
so as you can see it's very sparse

1212
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,720
and it's the only non-linear part

1213
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,640
of the

1214
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,800
whole circuit so the question the

1215
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,200
natural question is can we linearize

1216
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,800
this s-box using just a few guesses so

1217
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,640
an obvious way to do it is guessing two

1218
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,800
of the input bits so if i guess amb for

1219
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,440
instance then everything will be a

1220
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,200
linear function in c

1221
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,280
but that's not very good so the question

1222
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,839
is can i guess one bit

1223
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,599
depending on the input of the s box and

1224
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,839
linearize the s box

1225
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,000
and the answer is yes so what we show is

1226
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,920
that for any guess of a quadratic

1227
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,480
balance function in the input bits i can

1228
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,640
linearize the s box

1229
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,040
so let's do like a toy example to see

1230
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,760
how this works and take the most famous

1231
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,920
three bits balanced quadratic function

1232
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,040
that we know which is the three dot

1233
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,200
majority function

1234
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,240
okay

1235
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,079
so let's see i guess the majority and

1236
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,400
the majority is m the majority of the

1237
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,839
xbox inputs

1238
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,520
so let's see what happens so i'm going

1239
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,359
to look at the first output bit which is

1240
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,520
a plus bc the only nonlinear part in

1241
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,280
that is bc

1242
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,800
and one can easily verify that if i

1243
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,520
compute 1 plus b plus c times m i will

1244
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,839
exactly get bc

1245
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,839
so if i guess m and i know what the

1246
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,559
value of m is i have bc as a linear

1247
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,839
function of 1 plus b plus c if m is

1248
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,359
known to be a constant

1249
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,319
so yes i can write my output bits using

1250
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,200
the majority guess as linear functions

1251
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,200
in a b and c if the majority guess is

1252
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,480
not

1253
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,280
okay

1254
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,800
now mounting the attack after knowing

1255
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,640
this is pretty natural

1256
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,240
so okay first let's talk about the

1257
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,520
general case of this result so simply

1258
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,200
this is the full theorem that we have

1259
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,599
that we say for every balanced quadratic

1260
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,040
boolean function that we guess in the

1261
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,160
input bits

1262
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,400
i can write my s box in the following

1263
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,280
form

1264
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,319
which simply is that i can linearize it

1265
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,800
in a way knowing the majority knowing

1266
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,280
that value of f for

1267
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,319
the input

1268
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,359
okay so let's see how the attack works

1269
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,760
so the attack is really simple the idea

1270
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,760
is for every single round that i have on

1271
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,599
my cipher i will guess the image the

1272
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,520
input majority

1273
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,880
of all the s boxes that i have

1274
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,599
and linearize all the s boxes and then i

1275
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,480
would get a linear equation i form a

1276
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,960
linear dependency on p t and k is equal

1277
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,720
to my ciphertext

1278
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,880
so let's see how i can actually compute

1279
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,880
this equation so let's take

1280
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,680
one round i call the input to be i let's

1281
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,559
say

1282
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,599
knowing the majority guesses i can write

1283
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,680
the output of the s boxes as a linear

1284
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,599
function and i

1285
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,440
the affine layer is not doing anything

1286
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,240
much it's just like adding one more

1287
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,559
multiplying one more refined matrix

1288
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,480
to the value that i had before

1289
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,760
and then the key schedule is also linear

1290
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,680
so i get something in the end of the

1291
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,359
round that is linear in the inputs and

1292
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,880
the keys

1293
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,760
okay

1294
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,640
so

1295
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,160
doing this for every round i can get

1296
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,319
that type of equation that i want and

1297
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,920
what happens after i just solve this

1298
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,160
equation for k

1299
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,839
but after i solve this i should make

1300
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,440
sure that the majority guesses that i

1301
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,520
did were actually legit so

1302
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,760
the key that i guessed is actually

1303
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,079
consistent with the majority guesses so

1304
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,599
i need to check the consistencies by

1305
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,079
doing one more encryption

1306
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,119
simply

1307
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,200
okay so let's check the complexity of

1308
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,599
this attack i have 2 to the power rs

1309
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,760
possible majority so r is the rounds s

1310
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,319
is the number of s boxes in each round

1311
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,000
so for each majority guess i have to

1312
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,400
create this linear equations i have to

1313
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,480
solve the linear system and i have to

1314
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,240
check whether k is consistent with the

1315
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,880
majority guess

1316
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,160
okay the first one is n encryptions

1317
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,160
approximately the second one is one

1318
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,160
gaussian elimination or as we have an

1319
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,760
argument that's n over two are

1320
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,119
encryptions

1321
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,680
and the last one is just one encryption

1322
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,920
so that's my total complexity

1323
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,240
and because i have that two to the power

1324
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,200
rs

1325
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,760
term there if i go to three runs and in

1326
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,079
the full s box setting for a full layer

1327
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,520
s box that my

1328
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,359
s is n over three

1329
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,000
then the best i can do is

1330
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,040
break up to two rounds of my full layer

1331
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,160
variant

1332
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,359
and 2.8 and over restaurants for my

1333
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,880
partial layer variant okay

1334
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,680
so

1335
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,040
let's go to the meat in the middle

1336
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,280
attack

1337
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,400
so the idea here is i will linearize

1338
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,079
everything other than the first round so

1339
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,839
i will keep my first round as is and

1340
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,319
linearize everything that comes after

1341
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:17,040
then i will be splitting my key my k

1342
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,640
into two parts k1 and k2

1343
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,680
and then try to form some equations uh

1344
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,440
such that the left hand side but only

1345
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,680
depends on k1 and the right hand side

1346
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,599
would only depend on k2

1347
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,319
and having this i can because k1 and k2

1348
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,079
are like almost we can think of them as

1349
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,520
half the size

1350
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,520
i can try to do like a meat in the

1351
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,119
middle type of attacks like try to find

1352
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,920
collisions for these

1353
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,000
okay so let's see how i can form the

1354
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,240
equations

1355
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,640
so the idea is i will look at the states

1356
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,960
that is the output of the first round

1357
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,040
and the input to the rest of the rounds

1358
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,720
okay so let's look at the backward

1359
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,319
direction because we have

1360
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,960
linearized all the rest of the rounds

1361
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,280
so exactly i will write my k

1362
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,359
k1 to be first half of the key

1363
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,240
my k2 to be second half of the key

1364
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,520
and then w to be that middle round

1365
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,920
so i will guess the majority of the s

1366
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,319
boxes for the input majority of the s

1367
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,079
boxes for all the rounds other than the

1368
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,520
first one

1369
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,680
and then i will linearize all those

1370
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,680
rounds and get this type of an equation

1371
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,839
just as i had before so i have a linear

1372
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:27,440
equation in k and c t is equal to w

1373
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,880
this is exactly what we had in the

1374
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,599
linearization case and now because my i

1375
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,000
can write my k to be k1 plus k2 and l is

1376
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,920
a linear function i can get an equation

1377
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,079
of this form so w is a linear function

1378
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,359
in k1 plus a linear function in k2 plus

1379
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:44,079
some constant t

1380
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:45,599
okay

1381
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,280
and now let's see how the other

1382
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,319
direction works this is also

1383
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,160
very easy so what i will do is that i

1384
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,240
will propagate my circuit in the forward

1385
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,520
direction

1386
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,520
and try to get a quadratic equation of

1387
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,720
that form

1388
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,720
and one might ask why can i get that

1389
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,559
because i have those my functions are

1390
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,240
not linear anymore because my x boxes

1391
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,400
are quadratic but the point is if i take

1392
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,720
k1 and k2 such that their lengths are

1393
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,400
divisible by 3

1394
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,559
no bits from k1 and k2 will pass through

1395
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,480
the same s box so everything will still

1396
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,559
be separate from each other

1397
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,240
okay

1398
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,400
so i can write exactly an equation of

1399
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,680
that form so some quadratic f of k1 plus

1400
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,680
some quadratic g of k2 plus c is going

1401
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,400
to give me exactly the same w

1402
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,000
and now i'll just have to combine the

1403
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,839
two together and i get an equation of

1404
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,040
this form

1405
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,079
which f and g are quadratic and a and k

1406
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,440
are

1407
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,640
linear

1408
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,640
and from here it's pretty obvious what

1409
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,559
should be done so we just have to do a

1410
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,720
collision search for k1 and k2 on these

1411
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,000
values

1412
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
so i will just compute f plus a plus c

1413
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,079
for all k1 values that i have then i

1414
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,240
will compute g plus b plus t for all k2

1415
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,000
values that i have

1416
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,680
keep two lists of these

1417
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,200
and then find the collision between the

1418
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,720
lists

1419
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,640
okay

1420
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,000
okay

1421
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,720
so let's check the complexity so let's

1422
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,240
see what do i need for each majority

1423
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,240
guess i have to form these quadratic

1424
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,520
equations

1425
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,160
and then i have to evaluate uh f plus a

1426
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,520
and g plus b on those smaller spaces

1427
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,640
that i have and these we also

1428
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,640
have to can optimize it using

1429
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,359
trees or so i have 2 to the power r

1430
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,319
minus 1 as majority guesses

1431
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,319
and forming equations is not really

1432
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,160
costly compared to the next part which

1433
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,079
is going to be approximately 2 to the

1434
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,079
power and over 2

1435
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,520
encryptions

1436
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,559
okay and i can get rid of a factor of

1437
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,240
square root of n over two using three

1438
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,000
sorry yes

1439
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,079
okay and this is going to be my total

1440
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:45,520
complexity

1441
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,839
which again allows me to break up to two

1442
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,480
rounds of the fullest box variant

1443
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,040
okay so i'm gonna quickly go over to how

1444
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,640
we can do a meet in the middle for the

1445
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,520
partial layers box

1446
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,079
it's a bit of a different scenario

1447
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,640
and then conclude the talk so okay here

1448
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,599
again i want to split my key into one k1

1449
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,799
and k2

1450
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:09,280
but here the point is like i kinda

1451
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,440
cannot do the same because i have many

1452
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,280
more rounds and my degrees will start to

1453
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,640
get really high

1454
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,200
so what i will do i will have k1 and k2

1455
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,760
to be the round keys that were used

1456
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,720
in

1457
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,799
like some rounds in the beginning and

1458
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:24,559
some rounds in the end

1459
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,720
so the idea is i will split my rounds

1460
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,720
into three parts so i have r1 runs in

1461
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,000
the beginning as you can see on the

1462
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,880
right

1463
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,200
i have r2 rounds in the middle and r3

1464
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,960
rounds in the end

1465
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,960
so for the runs in the middle i will

1466
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,559
again guess the

1467
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,280
uh input majorities for all the s boxes

1468
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,880
that i have and i will linearize them

1469
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,319
completely

1470
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:45,920
and then i would do something similar

1471
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,480
for the first and last uh rounds that i

1472
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,359
have

1473
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,480
uh

1474
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,319
similar to what i did for the fullest

1475
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:53,359
box player

1476
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,119
okay

1477
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,319
and so i will call k1 to be the keys

1478
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,880
that we're using the r1 rounds and k2 to

1479
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,839
be the keys that we're using the r2 r3

1480
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:04,960
rounds

1481
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,200
and then try to do some kind of a meet

1482
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,359
in the middle for k1 and k2 but the good

1483
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:12,000
thing is i can actually argue that i can

1484
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,640
consider k1 and k2 to be of short length

1485
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,119
and why is that that's actually an

1486
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:20,799
argument that was done in uh wreck

1487
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:25,440
burgers that requires attack from 2018

1488
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,440
the fact is that although i have these

1489
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,599
really i hope the pointer is visible

1490
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,440
although i have these really

1491
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,359
key additions that are being done here

1492
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,440
as long as a key bit is not passing

1493
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,839
through an s box i can just apply the

1494
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,680
affine function and push that key to the

1495
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,880
next round

1496
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,280
and i just keep doing this

1497
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,400
and uh

1498
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,960
and push that portions of the key to the

1499
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,119
last round for instance and just have

1500
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:50,880
smaller keys for each round which are

1501
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,520
the size of the input bits of the s box

1502
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,280
so for each round

1503
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,280
the length of my key is the size of the

1504
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,839
inputs of the xbox okay

1505
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,680
so what i will do is that

1506
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,839
for the first r1 rounds that i have i

1507
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,400
will push all these keys forward

1508
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,720
so for all these r1 rounds i will have

1509
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,440
really small keys and also i can do this

1510
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,359
in the backward direction so i will do

1511
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:14,799
this in the backward direction for the

1512
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:19,040
r3 runs somehow so k1 and k3 now will

1513
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,799
have only 3s r1 and 3s r3 bits

1514
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,400
because that big key is now in that

1515
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,839
those middle rounds that i was

1516
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,160
linearizing

1517
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,000
okay

1518
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,359
so

1519
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:32,240
now

1520
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,240
let's see how the attack works

1521
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,000
so i will write my

1522
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,119
so i will

1523
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,319
denote the output of the r1 rounds as w

1524
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:43,280
output of the input of the r3 rounds as

1525
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,520
v and now because those middle rounds

1526
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,079
are linearized w and v have like a

1527
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,400
linear relation between them we will see

1528
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,559
it a bit but most importantly i can

1529
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:57,280
write my w as a quadratic function uh

1530
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,559
i can write it

1531
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:01,440
as a quadratic function in k1

1532
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,079
and i can write my v as a quadratic

1533
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,520
function in k2

1534
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,960
and then

1535
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,280
v can be written as a linear function in

1536
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,480
wk1 and k2 because of linearized those

1537
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,520
rounds

1538
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,079
and again i derive to an equation of

1539
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,119
this form so

1540
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,680
okay okay yeah it's just one slide okay

1541
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,000
so i get that l plus q and k1 is equal

1542
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,200
to l prime plus q prime and k2 and then

1543
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,799
again i do a meet in the middle because

1544
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:33,359
i have this type of approach

1545
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:34,720
okay and then

1546
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,039
so there's written that r1 and r2 should

1547
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:39,760
be approximately n over six

1548
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,079
for the attack to work okay

1549
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:44,319
so let's conclude this talk so we

1550
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:45,839
proposed two attacks the first one was

1551
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,599
the linearization attack

1552
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,920
it breaks up to two rounds for the full

1553
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,440
sbox variant

1554
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,720
and

1555
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,039
0.8 n over s runs for the partial sports

1556
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,559
variant you can see the complexities

1557
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,799
there

1558
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,680
we also have a meet in the middle attack

1559
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,920
that breaks up to two rounds for the

1560
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,839
full xbox variant

1561
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:08,319
and point eight and over restaurants for

1562
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,559
the partial box variant

1563
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,720
the bad thing is it's slower the good

1564
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,319
thing is actually it can be combined

1565
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:15,839
with another beat in the middle let me

1566
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:16,960
do in a

1567
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,359
work after this and can break more

1568
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:22,319
rounds of low mc as well

1569
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:23,839
okay

1570
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,760
and

1571
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,680
okay okay and thanks for listening and

1572
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,520
the take away message is be careful when

1573
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,920
you plan it

1574
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,170
thanks a lot

1575
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:38,309
[Applause]

1576
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,280
oh okay

1577
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,599
so thanks a lot are there any questions

1578
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,160
are there any bark are there any remote

1579
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,920
questions

1580
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,359
okay there's a question from christians

1581
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:03,280
[Music]

1582
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,920
uh so the memory is not very nice

1583
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,680
because you have to keep those very long

1584
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,200
lists so you can think that you need

1585
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,359
like 2 to the power n over 2 somehow

1586
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,359
memory to do it

1587
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,200
but okay we have like some

1588
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,359
work that we're actually doing now it's

1589
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:19,839
not available yet but exactly we

1590
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,839
address the memory issue how we can

1591
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:24,000
optimize it but yeah it's not really

1592
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,839
memory efficient for sure yes

1593
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,359
are there any other questions from the

1594
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:33,839
audience

1595
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,119
okay so

1596
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,359
okay thank you very much

1597
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:42,720
and we can move to the next step

1598
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:55,720
it goes through this one

1599
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,319
so next paper um so also best better

1600
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:21,359
award

1601
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:23,200
it's on wikis and reduced aegis and

1602
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,480
javascript

1603
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,559
uh so willie mayer will present the

1604
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,079
standards and congratulations for the

1605
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,119
best paper awards and so let's use yeah

1606
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:33,440
paper

1607
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,640
so this is trying to work with who can

1608
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,440
you

1609
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,240
takanori is obe and jose sakamoto

1610
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,200
normally uh phukang would give the talk

1611
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,200
and actually these are his slides

1612
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,520
so a brief overview so

1613
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,599
i would like to talk about cryptanalysis

1614
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,200
of which is mainly

1615
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,440
first i give a description of this

1616
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,559
cipher

1617
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,280
and then the attacks and very briefly i

1618
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,480
also talk about cryptanalysis of joshin

1619
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,880
and then i come to a summary with a

1620
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,799
brief discussion and conclusions

1621
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:15,680
so some background on ages 128

1622
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:21,759
ages 128 belongs to the aegis family

1623
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,640
so there are different variants

1624
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,039
so depending on the key size and also

1625
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,280
some other kind of issues

1626
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,520
this family has been designed by wu and

1627
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,480
prenel

1628
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,480
and has been submitted to the caesar

1629
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,160
competition

1630
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,119
actually aegis has been selected

1631
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,200
in the final portfolio of the high

1632
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,119
performance applications

1633
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,880
in the caesar competition for

1634
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,359
authenticated encryption

1635
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:50,960
so we find that aegis is a still a novel

1636
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,039
and efficient design

1637
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,839
that uses the aes round function as the

1638
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:58,160
main component

1639
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,880
there is something surprising here

1640
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,760
and there seems to be no cryptanalysis

1641
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,880
of the aegis initialization phase

1642
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,200
thus far despite the quite long history

1643
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,599
of the cease competition there are

1644
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:16,079
actually two very interesting papers for

1645
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:19,039
the keystream phase but nothing

1646
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,599
on initialization so we are really

1647
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:23,760
wondering whether it's too difficult or

1648
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,160
just not interesting but we find it

1649
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,960
interesting because it's a dedicated aes

1650
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,160
based cipher so it's non trivial to find

1651
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,839
out its security especially regarding

1652
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,559
initialization

1653
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:42,079
so a brief description of hs128

1654
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,599
initialization

1655
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:47,520
as we can see we have five uh blocks of

1656
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,680
words uh everything you can see here is

1657
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:54,079
128 feet long and a is just an

1658
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,680
abbreviation for one round of aes

1659
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:01,839
where we omit constant or key addition

1660
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:05,119
the key is introduced in the first part

1661
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:08,920
here so

1662
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,480
so actually it's depending on the

1663
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,880
parity of the round number it's either

1664
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,120
kx or n or k

1665
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,439
so when if i resort

1666
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:24,560
so it

1667
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,439
it's

1668
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:28,640
shown here x are zero is x are zero

1669
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,120
minus one plus a k

1670
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,040
a of x r minus one four plus k

1671
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,120
and the other

1672
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,080
words are updated in a similar way

1673
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,479
so when if r is even uh also the nonce

1674
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,920
comes in so we have an ounce of 128 bit

1675
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,560
as is quite common for this type of

1676
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,198
ciphers

1677
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:56,560
so the total number of rounds is 10

1678
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,479
and the initial state

1679
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,319
we can see that

1680
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:01,520
[Music]

1681
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,359
only x0

1682
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,759
depends on the nouns

1683
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:09,600
x1 and x2 are constant x3 depends on the

1684
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,120
k and x4 also depends on the k

1685
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,479
the output after our initialization

1686
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:17,679
rounds

1687
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,399
is assumed to be visible to an opponent

1688
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:27,040
which is theta is x r1 xor xr4 xor xr2

1689
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:30,238
and xr3 so there are quite some

1690
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:32,080
deviations actually

1691
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,880
from aes despite using it

1692
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,319
around as a

1693
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,920
component

1694
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,000
therefore we have been looking

1695
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,439
what is known about aes a lot is known

1696
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:46,640
there are

1697
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,479
really many papers

1698
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:49,839
of course there is a well-known

1699
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:52,399
foreground integral distinguisher there

1700
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:54,640
is even a five round multiple of eight

1701
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,840
distinguisher and a bit more recently

1702
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,239
there are the four five or six round

1703
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:03,520
yo-yo or yo-yo like distinguishes

1704
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,400
so

1705
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,800
which of these distinguishes could be

1706
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,719
applied to

1707
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,880
the ages 128

1708
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,360
initialization

1709
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,800
and

1710
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,880
we recall the observable output theta

1711
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:19,760
and

1712
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,520
we thought that the integral

1713
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,080
distinguisher is more suitable

1714
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,400
because we can independently

1715
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,199
study the integral property

1716
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:32,080
of each of these blocks or words

1717
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,320
and also of this and operation

1718
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,280
we guess that the other attacks may

1719
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:39,900
require

1720
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,440
[Music]

1721
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,000
to study into possible interactions

1722
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,280
between words but we don't say that

1723
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,080
other

1724
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,600
kind of known

1725
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,960
results wouldn't apply

1726
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,320
so our main strategy is to write down

1727
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,880
and study the integral properties of the

1728
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,400
expressions

1729
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,320
after our rounds

1730
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,440
independence of the nouns and the secret

1731
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,960
key k

1732
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,159
one wonders whether one would also look

1733
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:12,480
at boolean expressions maybe like cube

1734
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,600
attacks or something like that but we

1735
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,800
thought that the expressions are really

1736
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,040
complicated and also the state is very

1737
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,040
large compare

1738
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,159
as you compared to maybe

1739
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,719
cube attacks on stream sizes with small

1740
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,880
state or something like that

1741
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,239
so

1742
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,159
we are looking at

1743
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:38,080
at expressions in terms of the 128-bit

1744
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,040
words as a union because as a unit

1745
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,320
because uh

1746
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,000
the diffusion

1747
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,360
uh

1748
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,840
between words is not that strong if you

1749
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,040
look at the

1750
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,239
definition of the of ages and its

1751
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:54,239
initialization

1752
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:55,040
so

1753
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,520
actually it's an exercise to write down

1754
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,199
the expressions

1755
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,520
in terms of

1756
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,480
n

1757
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,600
after five rounds so well if you have

1758
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,640
considered this well is it nice or

1759
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,159
actually i should explain this red a's

1760
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:15,679
if one would write down step by step we

1761
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:18,480
have noticed where the new

1762
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,760
terms come in after i trading one more

1763
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,360
round so this a means that comes

1764
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,760
in the last step from the fourth to the

1765
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,280
fifth round

1766
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,880
but still it doesn't look very promising

1767
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:33,920
so

1768
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,000
what can we do here and also we have

1769
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:36,880
this

1770
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,880
non-linear part

1771
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,760
x5 2 and x3 so

1772
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,480
we need to do something better

1773
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,440
so we recall the initial state so we

1774
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,880
have this what we have seen before

1775
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,159
and then we write down for each

1776
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,719
around the expressions

1777
01:12:58,719 --> 01:12:59,600
so

1778
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,080
of course what we can do everything

1779
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,120
which is constant we just abbreviate

1780
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,000
with an

1781
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,920
another constant we have already the

1782
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,000
constants c0 and c1 and then we just

1783
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,120
count up for new constants

1784
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,280
so if r is 2

1785
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,560
we have

1786
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,760
other things which are constant

1787
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,920
and so this is the expression that

1788
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,040
doesn't look very complicated we need to

1789
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,880
look at the details

1790
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,280
we just at the moment it suffices if you

1791
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,480
look a little bit at the global picture

1792
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,719
if r is 3 it's

1793
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,840
even already a bit more complicated but

1794
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,080
an interesting thing is that the

1795
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,960
underlined expression

1796
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,880
can be

1797
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,199
simplified by

1798
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:53,920
adding a condition on the k on the key

1799
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,640
so and this is a crucial condition now

1800
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,320
if a of k

1801
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,600
plus c

1802
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,800
of the diagonal part so i should

1803
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,440
explain this notation we have to state

1804
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,400
after applying a and we just look at the

1805
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,960
main diagonal and if this coincides with

1806
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,760
the main diagonal of k

1807
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,400
of course we should say that

1808
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,920
we represent

1809
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,880
a 128 bit word

1810
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,560
as we do in aes as a six as a four times

1811
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,080
four

1812
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:32,239
bit array where each entry is 16 bit and

1813
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,400
in this language this

1814
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:38,320
expression 1 makes does make sense

1815
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,840
so if he

1816
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,120
as

1817
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,520
if we assume this condition then this

1818
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,560
whole underlined expression we have seen

1819
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,920
here becomes constant of course

1820
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,239
these are just claims here in this talk

1821
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,400
these are all based i should say on at

1822
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,880
least five properties which we had

1823
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,520
proved first well

1824
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,000
when you verify these things they are

1825
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,360
look quite easy i would say but uh first

1826
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,159
it was not so trivial to find out these

1827
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,520
proper

1828
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,840
properties

1829
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,280
so we can introduce a new constant

1830
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,120
and then

1831
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,600
after three rounds things

1832
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,400
look not so bad so it's

1833
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,640
it's okay for doing some further

1834
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,640
analysis

1835
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,239
but

1836
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:34,400
we have to do some other things so yeah

1837
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,679
further introduce another variable t

1838
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:41,600
which is c 0 x or a of k plus n

1839
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,960
then x 3 looks quite simple so that's

1840
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,679
really really simple

1841
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:48,880
so

1842
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,199
why is it useful to

1843
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:54,560
introduce another still another variable

1844
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,280
so as we see it makes all our

1845
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:02,080
expressions simpler and maybe easier to

1846
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:05,440
study another trick is we can get one

1847
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,239
more round in a kind of non-trivial way

1848
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:11,199
actually remember that for block ciphers

1849
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,159
maybe we can just add one or

1850
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:17,040
more rounds by uh partial key guessing

1851
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,440
or whatever this is not the case here we

1852
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,960
have to do something quite dedicated

1853
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,400
so uh

1854
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,760
often we now

1855
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:26,560
had

1856
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,440
started t rather than n but also that

1857
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,280
it's not quite trivial because we have

1858
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,199
to swap uh between t and n

1859
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,080
n is visible but t is not is only in

1860
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,719
place implicit

1861
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,600
so if we go for four rounds

1862
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,719
then we have this expression here so i

1863
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,440
skip it but for five rounds it still

1864
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,440
doesn't look very

1865
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:55,440
very promising so even after only two

1866
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,000
more rounds we have some relatively

1867
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,400
complicated expression and we wonder

1868
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,440
whether we are capable of now applying

1869
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,719
an integral distinguisher

1870
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:07,600
so

1871
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:12,640
we focus on each word separately so x51

1872
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,280
is the simplest it has this form and we

1873
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,080
can actually prove then the

1874
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,480
sum over uh

1875
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,920
two to the eighth values two t of zero

1876
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,960
zero then the sum is zero so this is an

1877
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,960
integral property

1878
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,280
and actually it's a it's it's not

1879
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,159
detailed here but it depends heavily on

1880
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:36,800
the definition of t and its properties

1881
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,679
and

1882
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:43,120
how going from n to t back and forth

1883
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,480
so secondly focus on x54

1884
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,440
so this is still quite complicated the

1885
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,440
first the summoned

1886
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,880
a of a of a of t plus something that

1887
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:58,800
that it's not so difficult we can derive

1888
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,600
an

1889
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,440
integral property

1890
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,000
based on the well-known three-round aes

1891
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,840
integral property

1892
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,440
but how about the second

1893
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,040
more involved summoned

1894
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:17,360
so if we look in it in form of a picture

1895
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,840
it doesn't look very promising so first

1896
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,679
we have a for all c for constant

1897
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:24,640
and

1898
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,560
then but further

1899
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,880
after three rounds it seems we might

1900
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,199
lose track

1901
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:34,159
so we look at it in more detail

1902
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:35,280
we

1903
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,480
consider the function g

1904
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,760
g is actually the function that's

1905
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,600
the argument of the latest a here of the

1906
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,520
leftmost a

1907
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,719
and

1908
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:49,760
then when

1909
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,600
it was proved in the paper again if t00

1910
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,120
takes all

1911
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,239
possible 2 to the 8th values for

1912
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:01,600
for each i and j the same value of g ihj

1913
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,000
will appear an even number of times so

1914
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,360
we have finally after the x4 we have

1915
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:11,840
even and after applying another round we

1916
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,520
have still balanced

1917
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,800
so we have still an integral property

1918
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,920
which is expressed in the

1919
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,040
low

1920
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:25,120
low abundance equation here on the

1921
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,840
on the side below

1922
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,520
so

1923
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,640
finally we need to focus on

1924
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,520
the

1925
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,480
and

1926
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,679
part

1927
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,760
so the a of t

1928
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,800
that's okay but then we have the all

1929
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,320
underlined stuff

1930
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:45,280
and it suffices to look at the sum of a

1931
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,880
of t and a of a of t plus c

1932
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,159
uh there very sum again over all a two

1933
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,800
to the eight possible values of t zero

1934
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,280
zero

1935
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,600
so uh we could prove that

1936
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,320
it has indeed uh an integral property

1937
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:06,400
but only if you restrict on the columns

1938
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,679
of the state 1 and 3 but be in your

1939
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,520
column 0.

1940
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,360
so this is again

1941
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,560
illustrated by a picture here actually

1942
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,880
it's equivalent the formula and the

1943
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,560
picture

1944
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,679
therefore for five round ages

1945
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:26,080
we have this nice

1946
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,239
integral property

1947
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:31,280
and we could even derive an ordinary

1948
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,280
integral property

1949
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,600
using the definition of t

1950
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,719
so that when we sum over the full

1951
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:43,280
diagonal of n of the nons then the sum

1952
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,600
over the values of theta is still zero

1953
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,120
so we get an alternate distinguisher

1954
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,400
then we have the weak key condition

1955
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,040
actually in order to go back and forth

1956
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,960
between t and then we need to introduce

1957
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:01,040
a big key condition

1958
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,840
and we look at this there are two to the

1959
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,679
24 possible values for the diagonal

1960
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,760
imposing this condition

1961
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,159
and and this can be pre-computed in a

1962
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:15,159
table

1963
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:16,800
so

1964
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,040
we first started

1965
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,880
because we can

1966
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,280
weak keys can back and forth we can

1967
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,480
study the distinguisher in terms of t

1968
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,120
rather than n and

1969
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,360
and using the relation

1970
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,159
t

1971
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:35,040
the other the definition of t

1972
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,040
and we can

1973
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:40,880
recover the value of the full diagonal

1974
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,760
of k

1975
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:48,080
so we again need a big key condition and

1976
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,360
uh

1977
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,000
it's it's going rather step by step

1978
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
that's in your here actually it's a bit

1979
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,400
more complicated and what is given on

1980
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,719
this formula

1981
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:00,560
about it

1982
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:01,600
ends up

1983
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,639
with a

1984
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:05,280
key recovery attack with data

1985
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,239
complexity 2 to the 32 and time

1986
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:11,040
complexity 2 to the 72

1987
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,199
and the number of keys because we have

1988
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:16,239
imposed the condition of 32 bits so this

1989
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:17,920
means we have

1990
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,159
2 to the 96

1991
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:21,760
big keys

1992
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,320
we obtain a valid key recovery attack

1993
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,199
because the complexity 2 to the 72 is

1994
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:31,120
quite lower than 2 to the 96.

1995
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,840
actually there would be four classes of

1996
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,719
weak keys instead of the main diagonal

1997
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:39,040
it could also use the other three

1998
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,760
diagonals

1999
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,340
so

2000
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:44,320
[Music]

2001
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,320
a very brief

2002
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,760
comment on

2003
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,199
the ashing so we applied similar ideas

2004
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,199
but the technical issues are a little

2005
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:55,760
bit different especially one special

2006
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,480
thing is that we have to impose

2007
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:01,280
conditions on the constants which rather

2008
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,520
which is rather uncommon

2009
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,440
so

2010
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,320
actually our attack only works if one

2011
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,880
would choose weak constants

2012
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,639
but fortunately the constants chosen

2013
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:18,159
in dashing don't

2014
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:22,000
fulfill these conditions so i skip this

2015
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,679
part and come to the discussions and

2016
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:29,440
conclusions so maybe

2017
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:33,440
studying ages and tagine like ciphers

2018
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,760
we have to impose weak key conditions

2019
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,960
otherwise we didn't succeed in any

2020
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,560
attack but still in this setting we

2021
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,440
reach half the number of initialization

2022
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,600
rounds maybe we

2023
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,320
one could say well it's not very

2024
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,800
exciting on the other hand it's quite we

2025
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,040
think it's uh

2026
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,040
nobody has done it before and i find

2027
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,600
it's non-trivial

2028
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,840
so

2029
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:05,120
uh for the touching there seems another

2030
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,679
issue that will actually run around this

2031
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:10,560
kind of useless because we can

2032
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:14,239
skip it to some extent

2033
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,760
so what we can say finally is that this

2034
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,719
is a rather dedicated analysis

2035
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:23,440
so it does not follow immediately from

2036
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:26,239
known results on aes

2037
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:28,639
so therefore we thought that it's

2038
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,880
an interesting contribution and maybe

2039
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,840
there could be other kind of analysis of

2040
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,239
similar

2041
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:41,320
ciphers so thank you

2042
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,840
thanks a lot will

2043
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,440
um are there any questions

2044
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,960
are there any questions from

2045
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,880
um but i have one question actually so

2046
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,199
that you have three constants

2047
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:05,199
and you actually need them for your

2048
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:08,480
attempt to work right yes

2049
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:10,840
due to your

2050
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:14,159
strength a good very good question but

2051
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:16,719
actually it's quite open because it's

2052
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:19,360
please repeat the question

2053
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,159
ah yes whether

2054
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,760
this

2055
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,400
restriction on constants whether it's

2056
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:30,080
due to our attack or due to the scheme

2057
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:33,280
due to the design

2058
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,400
so

2059
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,520
actually

2060
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,239
i cannot really finally answer this

2061
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:40,880
question because uh our

2062
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,880
attack is rather dedicated and maybe

2063
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,719
somebody else would could come up with

2064
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:47,679
another attack actually we also

2065
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:49,239
tried some

2066
01:25:49,239 --> 01:25:51,600
divisibility properties

2067
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:52,480
uh

2068
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,880
maybe there is something but our

2069
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,600
conclusion was that the basic

2070
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,400
the visibility property methods

2071
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,719
wouldn't work but there

2072
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:05,120
maybe there is some follow-up work

2073
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,159
which can

2074
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:09,120
break more rounds or resolve this

2075
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:13,120
relevant question for dashing

2076
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,400
are there any other questions

2077
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,440
i have a very short one and i didn't

2078
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,040
understand you said for taxi there is

2079
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:28,239
one round that is kind of uh useless is

2080
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:30,480
this for this attacker in general for

2081
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:33,120
all kind of attacks that's a again

2082
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,199
very interesting because if somebody

2083
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:37,679
else would like to uh do

2084
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:39,440
another design

2085
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,639
so

2086
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:43,440
definitely issues check our work and of

2087
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,320
course

2088
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:47,120
try to see whether other kind of similar

2089
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:51,400
attacks might work

2090
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,560
thank you

2091
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,760
thanks a lot

2092
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,000
um so this is the improvisation so we

2093
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,120
can thank again all the

2094
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,920
and now we speakers a coffee break of

2095
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,440
half an hour

2096
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,239
uh

2097
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:10,080
yes so we can stop and come back so

2098
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,600
people that are presenting the next

2099
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,600
session physically

2100
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,760
please find the session share and come

2101
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:21,120
here to put your slides on before it
