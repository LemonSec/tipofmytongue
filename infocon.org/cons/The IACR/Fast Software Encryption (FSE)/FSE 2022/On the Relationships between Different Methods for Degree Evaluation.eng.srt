00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,960
hello everyone

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,799
i'm sure tony the title of my report is

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,720
on the relationships

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,119
between different measures for degree

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,400
valuation this is a joint work with jojo

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,519
and sasha chang

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,240
and this report is composed of four

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,558
parts first we will give a brief

9
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,840
introduction on the background of our

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,760
work

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,320
and then discuss the degree evaluation

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,879
of spn and nfsr based several

13
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,280
in part 2 and part 3

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,079
and finally in part 4 we conclude our

15
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,320
work

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,000
the output of symmetric ciphers can be

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,080
regarded as boolean function over the

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,119
input

19
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,439
variables

20
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,479
so

21
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,080
if a server

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,240
at this low algebraic degree

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,080
distinguishing tax or recovery attacks

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,479
can be achieved

25
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,040
such as integral attacks

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,400
queue products

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,280
higher order differential tags and some

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,840
algebraic tags

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,200
so it's very important to estimate a

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,920
test bond on the algebraic degree

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,159
and there are four effective long-term

32
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,280
methods to estimate algebraic degree

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,720
first

34
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
for the spm methods

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,119
servers there are two formula based

36
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,560
bonds

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,439
one is purposed by bora and the

38
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,560
candidates

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,680
we call it this event

40
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,119
another is purposed by carlet

41
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,479
we call it collect bond

42
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,960
this example shows the effect

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,560
effectiveness of the two bonds

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,879
the triple bond which is the maximum

45
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,680
degree at round four however the two

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,000
bonds give the degree of

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
29 at round four which is more accurate

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,599
than the triple bond

49
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,680
for nfsr business servers

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,720
new proposed the numeric mapping methods

51
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,440
especially for trivium lag

52
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,560
an efficient algorithm based on numerous

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,800
mapping was given

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,440
the last one is division property it's a

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,519
generalized method

56
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,239
this is a definition of word-based gp

57
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,160
and this is the definition of two

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,280
subsets

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,319
bit based dp

60
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,840
in the application of dp to search for

61
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
integral distinguishes

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,879
we usually fix the

63
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,879
input dp

64
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,679
of several e

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
and to judge whether

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,720
the output dp of several e

67
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,040
sorry

68
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,800
to judge you the minimum of the

69
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,200
output division property is no more than

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,920
one a lot

71
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,680
when estimating the aspect degree it's a

72
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,400
result process we need to

73
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,680
fix the output dp to 1 and maximize the

74
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,360
input dp that can propagate to 1

75
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,319
then the maximum of zinc dp can be

76
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,560
regarded as an upper bound on the

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,599
algebraic degree note that

78
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,280
this dp

79
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,680
is bpsdp

80
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,000
for the sql convenience we call it the

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
bdp method next

82
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,399
let us first focus on the spn servers

83
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,840
from above introduction we know the bdp

84
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,200
is the whole process and the two bonds

85
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,759
is an interpretive process when

86
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,079
estimated the degree of sp method so

87
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,040
we cannot compare

88
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,520
some straightforwardly

89
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,199
so we have to construct the bridge to

90
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,680
link's loan

91
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,120
okay

92
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,759
this is our bridge

93
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,240
a based on division property we propose

94
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,720
the bond on the composite function

95
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,560
ft denotes the composition of t function

96
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,759
of f

97
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,800
w t omega f delos the

98
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,120
way to minimum of up to the division

99
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,479
property of ft when we fix the weight of

100
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,800
input dp to omega

101
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,680
thus

102
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,000
the degree of this composition

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,759
is upper bounded

104
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,360
by the minimum of this site

105
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,400
it's simple to prove it

106
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,240
first let w be this set

107
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,960
assuming that for an arbitrary multi-set

108
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,840
x it

109
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,639
has division property of k0 and the

110
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,199
president of melissa is 1 belongs to

111
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,120
this set

112
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,639
net x is the input of ft and y is the

113
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,600
output of ft and it has the division

114
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
property of p1

115
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,080
moreover let's save is

116
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,600
output

117
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,880
size of g and it have division it has

118
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,400
division property of k2

119
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,320
from the slope from the definition of

120
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,160
set w

121
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,440
we have the division property of k1 is

122
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,840
larger than the degree of g and

123
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,479
according to the propagation rule of

124
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,600
division properties through function

125
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
we have the division property of k2 is

126
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,479
less is low less than 2.

127
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,160
look at that

128
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,479
the division property k

129
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,919
2 can be calculated as follows

130
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,319
so we can deduce

131
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,880
the degree of this composite function is

132
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,319
less than t 0 because degree is actually

133
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,319
an integer so the degree of this

134
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,199
is no more than

135
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,680
physiology is 1

136
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,840
because of the arbitrariness of

137
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,800
set x and k 0 so the degree of this

138
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,720
is no more than the

139
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,120
minimum of set problem

140
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,520
that is our conclusion

141
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,520
note that

142
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,639
in this new bond t is

143
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,240
t is flexible so

144
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,919
now we set t2 1

145
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,240
we can have this conclusion

146
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,039
is that our new bond is

147
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,120
test than bc bonds

148
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,199
in order to prove

149
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,479
this conclusion we need this number

150
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,960
it indicates the relation between the

151
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,440
division property and the algebraic

152
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
property of an

153
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,520
xbox

154
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,319
now

155
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,000
let us prove the proposition too

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,800
it's equivalent to prove the bc bonds

157
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,639
actually belongs to this set

158
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,360
furthermore is equivalent to proof when

159
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,520
we fix the width of input dp of f to pc1

160
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,319
plus 1 the output dp of the f is worries

161
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,280
more than the degree of function g

162
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,000
so assuming that

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,039
the vector of k to k star is the word

164
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,240
based division 2 of function f thus for

165
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,800
any xbox fg kj to kj star is a word with

166
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,280
the division two of

167
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,479
the xbox sg

168
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,479
thus

169
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,160
the weight of the dp of f can be written

170
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,759
as this form

171
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,759
look that beta j is always

172
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,599
no more than gamma so

173
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,240
we replace eta g by gamma

174
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,000
now we can obtain this inequality

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,080
furthermore replace this sum by the left

176
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,279
equation so

177
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,640
we finally have the weight of our

178
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,640
weight of output dp of f

179
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,040
is actually more than the degree of

180
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,200
function g

181
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,560
and that is

182
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,518
if we fix the weight of input dp of fg2

183
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,120
to the bc bound plus one then

184
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,160
the weight of output division property

185
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,519
of f is more than the degree of g

186
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,279
so our conclusion holds

187
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,240
similar we can obtain the same

188
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,880
conclusion when comparing

189
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,160
the

190
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,399
current bond

191
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,959
here we omit the proof of this

192
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,920
conclusion because the detail of this

193
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,279
proof is similarly is similar to the

194
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,399
proof of

195
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,360
proposition 2.

196
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,680
now we can compile the bdp method with

197
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,480
the pc bonds and current bound on the

198
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,560
degree evaluation of an r1 r17

199
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,399
this is our bridge by fixing t

200
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,800
to different value and considering

201
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,120
different type of division property we

202
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,920
have

203
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,200
three models from these funds

204
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,560
in model 1 we consider the beta-based dp

205
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,920
and the g is an identical function we

206
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,360
fix t to r in model 2 we consider word

207
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,399
based dp and g is an identical function

208
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,880
we fixed t to r

209
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,320
in model 3 we consider verb with dp and

210
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,399
set t21

211
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,120
this time g is always varying with the

212
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,880
round increase

213
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,640
apparently

214
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,079
model 1 is equivalent to the

215
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,040
bdp method

216
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,040
and from

217
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
previous analysis

218
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,519
the model 3 is more accurate than the

219
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,800
two banks

220
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,880
moreover

221
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,720
beta-based dp

222
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,680
is a more accurate dp and

223
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,640
water-based gdp

224
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,120
thus model 1 is more accurate than model

225
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,959
2. furthermore model 2 considers the

226
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,480
influence of linear line on the dp

227
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,800
on the division property

228
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,320
propagation

229
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,279
but the model 3 does not so

230
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,720
model 2 is more accurate than model 3

231
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,320
as a result

232
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,160
below bdp

233
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,839
is equivalent to model 1 model 1 is more

234
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,560
accurate than model 2 model 2 is more

235
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,399
accurate than model 3

236
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,360
modus 3 is more accurate than the two

237
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,120
bonds so

238
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,680
finally

239
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,920
we have the bdp method is more accurate

240
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,399
than two bonds

241
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,680
we apply the bdp and the two bonds to

242
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,240
the underlying permutations of key

243
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,079
charge and kilo servers

244
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,880
the results show that

245
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,680
bdp method can obtain the tighter

246
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,239
algebraic degrees than the two bonds

247
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,839
now we focus on the nfl service

248
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,399
server

249
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,880
assuming that there is a simplified

250
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,760
stream server based on

251
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,360
based on nbc and fsr

252
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,200
this is the

253
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,800
updated process of interstate

254
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
g and f

255
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,200
are the update function and output

256
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,560
function

257
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,160
the encryption process can be simplified

258
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,719
as this

259
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,920
uh we first proposed two bonds on the dp

260
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,760
degree of ant

261
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,360
and actual operations as yearly states

262
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,480
in

263
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,720
provocation 4 and proposition 5.

264
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,160
proposition 4 indicates that

265
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,680
the dp degree

266
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,880
of a monomial is no more than the sum of

267
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,680
the dpt phase of the involved state

268
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,560
the probability 5 indicates that the dp

269
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,160
degree of a polynomial is equal to the

270
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,440
maximum

271
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,839
of the dp degree of the content

272
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,600
monomials

273
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,360
both conclusions

274
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,160
same trivial but not trigger to be

275
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,200
proved

276
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,040
which is complex

277
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,480
so we omit the proof here

278
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,920
if you can

279
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,399
if you take some interest you can refer

280
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,880
to our paper

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,399
now we compare the bdp method with

282
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,720
numeric mapping on the division property

283
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,199
on the simplified

284
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,920
stream sample

285
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,839
the conclusion is that

286
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,279
for any state bit as i as

287
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,160
n clock t

288
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,639
its dp degree

289
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,839
is no more than its numerator

290
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,480
degree here we give a brief proof

291
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,839
note that

292
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,040
when t is equal to 0 the state is

293
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,440
initial state

294
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,079
so both of the dp degree and numerator

295
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,360
degree

296
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,320
are equal to the exact degree

297
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,600
after one clock iteration the dp degree

298
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,199
can be

299
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,639
read as this form

300
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,040
from proposition 5 and this

301
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,320
can be also reset at this form from

302
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,800
proposition 4

303
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,839
so we have the dp degree of

304
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,760
sn at

305
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,839
clock

306
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,839
1. is no more than the numerator degree

307
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,399
similar

308
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,839
after t minus 1 times iterations we have

309
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,480
the following conclusion that is

310
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
for sn at clock t

311
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,880
its dp degree

312
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,720
is no more than its numerator degree

313
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,680
we apply the bdp method and numeric

314
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,920
mapping to trivium and the chromium

315
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,480
stream servers we can see that the dp

316
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,920
degree

317
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
which is red

318
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,720
is always

319
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,480
tighter than that of

320
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,519
numerator degree

321
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,560
which is blue and

322
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,279
we can say the gap

323
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,320
between them are more and more distinct

324
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,959
with round increasing

325
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,959
both for tree film and equipment

326
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,639
okay in this work we give an argument on

327
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,959
the relationships between the different

328
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,440
numpad methods for algebraic degree

329
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,800
evaluation

330
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,680
and we conclude that the

331
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,480
btp method is the optimal one from the

332
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,199
accuracy perspective

333
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,959
additional

334
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,040
monomial prediction and three subject

335
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,600
division property measures can be

336
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,519
utilized to compute the exact degree

337
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,240
but they are time consuming if you do

338
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,680
not try some optimization strategies

339
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,199
because both of them need to enumerate

340
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,560
the tools

341
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,639
from input propagating to the output

342
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,399
therefore

343
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,240
for symmetric server if you're expected

344
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,120
to explore some special optimization

345
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,240
strategies to get the exact degree you

346
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,360
can consider the monomial prediction or

347
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,160
