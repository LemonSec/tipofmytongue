1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,760
so welcome back on this presentation

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,680
about the initial symbol and the modulus

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,600

biases

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,519
um the modulation of this work requires

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,480
a design of uh similar communities over

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,040
by things

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,800
like for example uh

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,000
function in some cases

10
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,600
function

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,040
however all these applications are some

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,760
things in common um

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,440
the fact that

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,399
this location usually works over a prime

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,960
fees where p is a large prime integer so

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,440
using these

17
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,719
weights

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,840
um this is quite different from tension

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,439
schemes like

21
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,640
okay

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,080
um

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,040
in such cases usually defined where as

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,720
mumbai feed like

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,439
eight feet or five minutes so decimal

26
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,439
can be potentially precomputed as soon

27
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,600
as a table yeah it's very easy to

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,439
understand that due to the size of the

29
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,079
prime this is not uh this is absolutely

30
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,840
not possible

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,280
this means that um

41
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,599
the first part of these uh presentation

42
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,519
in this first part of this presentation

43
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,200
i'm going to present

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,399
uh several implementations

45
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,920
and in the second part of this

46
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,640
presentation i'm going to

47
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,599
about they just mentioned

48
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,599
first of all let me know what the

49
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,280
relationship is

50
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,560
so we have um so we have b that is uh

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,959
integer we assume that b is at least

52
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,800
three

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,200
symbols that is a function

54
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
from fb to uh into minus one zero one so

55
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,560
rb is the

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,080
um

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,560
the difference of integer will be

58
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,599
and the and asian simple return here is

59
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,640
zero does minus one if the input

60
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,640
is

61
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,519
symbol is also be defined

62
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,959
um as a power map where the exponent is

63
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,439
p minus one off

64
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,080
now you can see that as many properties

65
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,959
i just record a few of them

66
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,040
first of all if we have x and y which

67
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,238
should be probably

68
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,079
the negative symbol of x is equal to the

69
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,839
division of y

70
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,400
and then second and

71
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,000
most important for the following

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,320
creation of the product is equal to the

73
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,360
product rotation

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,199
is this one

75
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,840
we have x input and the function return

76
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,880
x to the power of e times alpha plus

77
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,080
delta symbol of x

78
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,360
it is possible to prove that this

79
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,440
function is irrational if these two

80
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,759
assumptions are satisfied so first of

81
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,040
all d is a positive integer which is

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,080
co-prime with p minus one

83
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,639
and second

84
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,440
um just give a great example

85
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,280
if b is equal to one will go for we can

86
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,160
just

87
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,759
fix alpha equal to zero

88
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,440
now why this function is inversion well

89
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,360
let's say that

90
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
y is the output of this function it's

91
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
easy to know that

92
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
y is equal to 0

93
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,360
0

94
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,880
if this is not the case

95
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,199
um let's computation symbol of the

96
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,240
output now by using the properties of

97
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,080
the relationship the initial symbol of

98
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,680
the product is equal to the product of

99
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,039
the agency

100
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,960
and now

101
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,120
d is uh

102
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,400
an integer solution of x to the power of

103
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,360
t is just equal to the transceiver x

104
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
and here we have the relationship of

105
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,080
alpha plus station symbol of x

106
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,720
if x is different from zero this

107
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,759
quantity is either minus one or one

108
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,520
but we don't care because by assumption

109
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,880
of alpha plus one so we can easily

110
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,400
invert this function

111
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,440
um

112
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,680
so the inverse is given by this

113
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,319
expression where the

114
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,880
power map

115
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,199
[Music]

116
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,560
however we can mix this function voicing

117
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,520
variable by changing the assumption on d

118
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,479
so this function is similar as before

119
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,360
but now the inverted v

120
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,080
this is is satisfied so if d plus p

121
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,120
minus 1 alpha is co-prime with p minus

122
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,360
1.

123
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,080
the reason is very simple this function

124
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,198
is just a power mass with this exponent

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,319
now this function has been proposed for

126
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,720
uh graphics we are going to use uh we

127
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,840
are going to study this new week

128
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,520
i just would like to

129
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,400
highlight these results

130
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,759
so if p is equal to one multiple then d

131
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,840
is always equal to d prime where d prime

132
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,759
is just a positive integer that is

133
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,080
called with p minus one and this

134
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,919
basically goes from um

135
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,080
is p is equal to three on the word that

136
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,479
t is equal to two times d prime where

137
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,440
the independent is uh cochrane with

138
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,319
one

139
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,759
um

140
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,479
so if p is equal to one over four time t

141
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,599
is always

142
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,759
an odd integer if p is equal to primary

143
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,160
lower than p so with any integer if you

144
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,680
want to guarantee that this function is

145
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,449
[Music]

146
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,120
[Music]

147
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,960
expression of this function

148
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,280
and um it's very easy to prove that this

149
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,200
function is invertible if

150
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,080
p plus and d minus are co-planned with

151
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,360
pns1

152
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,399
and the reason is very simple

153
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,240
now this function makes sense if d blast

154
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,120
is different from

155
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,760
but in such a demonstration

156
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,600
the function can be worked as

157
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,040
a uh

158
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,959
instance with this function you can

159
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,279
potentially program via channel or

160
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,560
folder

161
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,040
and the reason is that um depending on

162
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,240
input

163
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,720
we are going to compute two different

164
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,279
power mass which i mean with a different

165
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,920
cost so um

166
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,839
depending because we can require some

167
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,600
information about the input

168
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,760
uh functions that are set up

169
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
uh using the action symbol so if you are

170
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,000
interested i refer to the paper uh

171
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,399
so i just would like to

172
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,560
recall some of these properties where

173
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,959
they function that they just purpose

174
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
so in this table we have a function that

175
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,760
i just mentioned the condition for the

176
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,200
inverted pd

177
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,560
um

178
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,080
some consideration about the maximum

179
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,120
differential immediate some

180
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,320
consideration about detrimental

181
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,680
properties

182
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,880
so let's start with the initial

183
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,200
properties the joint is always referred

184
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,640
to the investigation of the function and

185
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,760
in these cases we have that um

186
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
representation is parsed and that the

187
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,760
equation of the function is i

188
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,560
is p minus one of uh plus uh something

189
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,279
um the reason for this is very simple um

190
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,040
the relational symbol

191
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,710
is a power map so

192
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,079
[Music]

193
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,480
we can immediately reduce that the

194
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,360
representation is

195
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,160
related to the degree of relevancy

196
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,200
what about these properties

197
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
in this case we have to

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,160
trace two cases

199
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,480
so let's take this function or by any of

200
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,399
these three functions unless this

201
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,680
division symbol let's remove the agency

202
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,640
degree of the function is two then the

203
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
maximum function will be the constant

204
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,079
divided by p and since p is very large

205
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,920
this means that we have a good maximum

206
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,760
differential

207
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,399
if the degree of the function is one

208
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,320
then um

209
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,279
dimensionally probably is one off and we

210
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,959
expect that because for example in this

211
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,399
case we have

212
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,399
something that is basically in your

213
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,800
function

214
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,680
so this is an review for the certificate

215
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,599
and the properties for the function

216
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,519
let's now consider some communications

217
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,720
because x squared is to minus x to the

218
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,079
power of two

219
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,720
however we can easily move we can likely

220
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,399
find this function in order to get

221
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,600
something that

222
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,720
is very simple

223
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,680
if x if the input is equal to zero

224
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,209
[Music]

225
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,519
to minus one

226
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,760
so the function is x squared times

227
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,399
alpha to the power of x

228
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,920
um so in this way we will get a function

229
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,120
that is inverted

230
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,079
now um i'm going to be sure why function

231
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,600
is

232
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,680
quite interesting

233
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,519
and in order to please we prove that the

234
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,920
function is injective so

235
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,480
if f of x is equal to f of y

236
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,800
this implies x equals y

237
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,880
uh we work with our final phase so

238
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,639
injective implies that the function is

239
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,120
so first of all we know that the output

240
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,160
is equal to

241
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,800
even if

242
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,760
so from now on i assume that the input

243
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,000
of this function is different from zero

244
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,959
and now um let's consider this case

245
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,839
let's assume that f of x is alpha times

246
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,680
x square and f y is equal to y square v

247
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,720
so this happens if x is equal to

248
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,760
1

249
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,800
and y is equal to 0.

250
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,160
but now this is to observe that

251
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,600
disavoiding

252
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,720
nerves because on the right hand side we

253
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,959
have a square groupie and on the left

254
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,680
hand side we have a number of receivers

255
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,760
alpha is a number

256
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,519
so this situation can never occur

257
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,079
and this means that if f of x is equal

258
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,279
to y

259
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,839
then x modulo 2 is equal to y minus 2.

260
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,440
now let's write

261
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,240
that

262
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,440
this

263
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,639
which is easier

264
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,600
one

265
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,560
difference

266
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,720
um so f of x equals f of y implies

267
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,680
this

268
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,760
so i go to the power of that time x

269
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,360
square is equal to r to the power of

270
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,800
that times y square which means that x

271
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,000
is just uh is equal to plus or minus y

272
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,279
but now

273
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,279
if that if x is equal to zero

274
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,090
then minus x

275
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,159
[Music]

276

[Music]

277
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,480
[Music]

278
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,560
representation of this function is given

279
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,680
by

280
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,800
this point

281
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,720
where we have um

282
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,399
these functions that is a

283
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,600
function so

284
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,199
that the exponent

285
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,240
are just

286
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,360
integer

287
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,000
plus a single monomial of uh

288
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,480
degree two where the coefficient of this

289
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,040
one is one plus alpha divided by two

290
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,600
now as you can observe this function can

291
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
be potentially tense and could be of

292
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,320
maximum degree so we consider several

293
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,079
values of alpha and we try to evaluate

294
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,800
the um the density of this function for

295
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,120
these different bands

296
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,040
for example

297
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,760
this is an example for alpha

298
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
and so this is efficiency

299
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,480
so we have another function uh here we

300
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,839
have um

301
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,240
several values of b tests and here we

302
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,560
have uh the number of numbers

303
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,040
so in blue we have the expected number

304
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,920
of monogamous for a function and in

305
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,959
writing

306
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,600
really number of the complete number of

307
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,160
uh dysfunction

308
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,920
as you know

309
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,639
the blue lines are very very close and

310
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,040
by excitement check that the function is

311
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,240
basically always maximum degree

312
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,160
so the properties of this function are

313
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,560
quite nice

314
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,480
but let's analyze

315
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,690
this case available my song in what it

316
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:14,399
[Music]

317
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,240
exactly that minus one is a non-parallel

318
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,079
p

319
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,920
so in this case we have the function

320
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,160
minus 1 to the power of x minus 2 times

321
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,759
x squared

322
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,920
but what i want to emphasize is that in

323
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,839
this particular case we don't have to

324
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,399
compute the bluetooth operator and so

325
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,399
this function is just minus 1 to the

326
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,199
power of x times x squared

327
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,880
and this different representation could

328
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,759
be easier to compute in some

329
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,639
in some applications

330
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,390
moreover if we

331
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,600
[Music]

332
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,759
slightly change this function we have

333
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,639
something that is always invertible

334
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,040
um so if you consider the function minus

335
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,920
1 to the power of x squared times x then

336
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,759
this function is inverted

337
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,680
and the reason is very simple

338
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,199
let's just take the output of this

339
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,679
function this square this output is

340
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,760
equal to the square of input which means

341
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,319
that x is equal to minus one to the

342
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,319
power y squared times y

343
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,359
um

344
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,520
and again we can slightly define this

345
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,480
function for example we can

346
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,400
set up assumptions of minus 1 to the

347
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,319
power of x squared times x to the power

348
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,959
of b which is invertible if

349
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,840
d is four prime with p minus

350
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,320
one um as before let us a quick look

351
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
about the angelic and statistical

352
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,480
properties of this function

353
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,400
um now in this case we consider the

354
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,640
energy properties

355
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,400
we have that all these three functions

356
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,080
are text and usually of maximum degree

357
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,919
so with respect to the

358
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,240
functions of variation

359
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,280
we have a better properties because in

360
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,640
this case the function

361
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,160
is the function were

362
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,400
sparse

363
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,520
regarding the maximum differentiability

364
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,320
we have seen the result before so again

365
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,799
if we are going to please the model very

366
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,400
good

367
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,880
then if the resulting function is one

368
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,400
then the maximum differential will be

369
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,919
basically one if the degrees of freedom

370
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,600
then the measurement differential is a

371
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,240
constant divided by p where again this b

372
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,880
is very large so um

373
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,559
we get those

374
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,039
properties

375
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,120
so we have several implementations of

376
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,640
rfp we have a good statistical property

377
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,520
and good properties so we can

378
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,760
we can see that if we set up as many

379
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
penalties essentially if we want

380
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,360
instrumentation

381
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,840
we could then

382
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,120
achieve great security

383
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,000
for me

384
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,120
the number

385
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,760
output stations or

386
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,000
the multiple operator is very very small

387
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,919
compared to the size of p

388
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,640
for example you can see we return just

389
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,200
three output minus one zero one which

390
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,280
means basically just minus one and one

391
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,720
because theorem uh firstly only is which

392
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,520
input is zero

393
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,280
zero one so we have two output compared

394
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,840
to p possibly but

395
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,520
when p is very large

396
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,400
so

397
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,160
how can we take

398
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,640
how can we potentially make a primitive

399
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,840
setup in this function well linear is to

400
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,400
fix automation symbol and

401
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,200
operator if the actual representation of

402
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,960
the scheme has logically we can

403
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,120
potentially try to make this india some

404
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,159
hydroponic device

405
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,160
in more details let's consider

406
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,480
similarity which could be a sci-fi

407
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,200
this is

408
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,120
like for example popularization

409
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,400
databases or group finding technique

410
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,799
and during the solution we should give

411
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,360
the fine default solutions satisfied

412
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,679
issues symbol or

413
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,039
functions that release in the first

414
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,000
if not we just repeat

415
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,159
the present

416
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,680
[Music]

417
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,880
is a sponge function which is

418
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,039
instantiated via an integrated

419
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,600
permutation of app

420
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,159
where the function is defined in space

421
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,400
so we have a constant addition the

422
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,039
linear layer

423
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,080
right

424
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,080
[Music]

425
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,240
be sure that this function is inverting

426
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,630
um

427
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,760
[Music]

428
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,159
so in this case we would fix all these

429
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,280
lesions

430
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,159
we consider the system of equation that

431
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,799
create input of there is the output of

432
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,440
dash and we try to solve this

433
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,280
system equation

434
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,919
if the solution satisfies all these

435
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,640
responsible that we reform

436
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,720
our branch

437
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,080
now in one particular case um we have an

438
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,280
h value in fb and we look for our image

439
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,159
of this form so x will get a lead with x

440
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,120
prime where x prime is six

441
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,520
so the system is actually just one

442
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,000
equation in one variable that links the

443
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,120
input with the output of the sponge

444
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,679
for solving integration we can just use

445
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,080
our final approach whose

446
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,919
cost is proportional to the degree of

447
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,760
the equation

448
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,360
and in such a case the way of the

449
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,080
equation is e to the power of r where r

450
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,039
is the number found and d is the degree

451
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,039
of the defined aspects

452
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,480
so this exponent d

453
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,760
um so before presenting ourselves i

454
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,559
would like to point out that uh

455
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,880
strategies has been proposed by credit

456
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,240
designer

457
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,919
um

458
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,400
but there is a difference in our case we

459
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,960
consider a

460
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,320
which means they have many crystals they

461
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,159
have many variables but each one

462
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,520
distribution as um blue green

463
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,480
um

464
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,720
so in such a case you are forced to use

465
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,960
for example

466
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,400
which is uh

467
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,760
and there's something to show more

468
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,120
expensive even if all distribution up uh

469
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,679
so let's have a look at our concrete so

470
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,760
let's consider planning the target is

471
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,640
the security level of 128 piece and

472
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,880
where p is 2 to the power of 256

473
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,880
these are different instances of credit

474
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,360
so these degrees of the answers for

475
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,440
example 2 35

476
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,840
and

477
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:10,809
[Music]

478
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,039
many more round than the

479
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,440
ones proposed by design for example if t

480
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,840
is equal to 2 and n is equal to 12 then

481
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,000
we can just play one round

482
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,799
but

483
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,200
if e is equal to 5 and n is equal to 8

484
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,679
we can break four morals variation

485
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:48,400
so

486
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,159
here you can see that there the money

487
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,360
number found some cases

488
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,890
[Music]

489
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,400
and just like point out that these two

490
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,559
operators are not defined by their fees

491
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,440
so

492
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,240
their priorities are some allows for

493
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,159
new idea new direction of research so

494
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,159
i think it's a really interesting uh

495
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,640
message

496
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,720
um

497
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,279
the result of our analysis show that

498
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,159
yes

499
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,720
we can set up new functions

500
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,320
using approach that are not possible

501
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,200
but

502
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,520
we should be careful when using such

503
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,400
such functions because new attacks are

504
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,840
also possible

505
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,120
um that's also

506
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,799
interesting i think

507
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,960
and um finally we would like to leave

508
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,159
another problem for future research um

509
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,400
so in this video we just proposed

510
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,559
samurai permutation and we consider the

511
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,760
security of our scheme is achieved with

512
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,360
the implementations that are generation

513
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,520
symbol or the module operator

514
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,279
but we actually never consider the

515
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,240
efficiency of this function or of a

516
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,120
primitive setup we are essentially with

517
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,640
