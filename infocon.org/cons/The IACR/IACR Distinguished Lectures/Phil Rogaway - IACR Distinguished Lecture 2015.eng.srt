1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:06,029
so it is my great pleasure to announce

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:09,389
the third invited talk for the Asia

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,910
Crips 2015 conference and that is the

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,639
IAC our distinguished lecturer Phil

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,980
Rockaway Phil as everyone knows is a

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,390
professor at UC Davis has had an

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,420
extremely distinguished career in

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,550
cryptography written I don't know some

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,619
like hundred 50 papers many of which are

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,510
incredibly highly cited and he's had a

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,820
great impact on the field and he's gonna

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,470
give us all a lot of food for thought

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,030
today I think with his lecture on the

14
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:39,510
moral character of cryptographic work

15
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:41,430
Thank You Phil and thanks to the ICR

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,820
Board for inviting me to give today's

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,649
talk I guess they take a bit of a risk

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,350
when you invite Phil to give a talk you

19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,789
have no idea what might come out so what

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,809
I'd like to talk about today is

21
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,820
something that's I've been quite

22
00:00:53,809 --> 00:01:02,309
obsessing over since the summer of 2013

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:04,949
and that is the the moral character of

24
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,350
cryptographic work and the corresponding

25
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,420
moral responsibilities of cryptographers

26
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,539
and of the cryptographic community as a

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,540
whole

28
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,460
I'd like to try and set things in

29
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,040
context by discussing social

30
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,009
responsibility of scientists in general

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,380
I think our current conception of the

32
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,750
social responsibility of scientists

33
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:30,110
emerged during World War two and it's

34
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:33,860
aftermath and three particular events I

35
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:36,380
think were especially formative the

36
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,759
first of these events was the experience

37
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:43,729
of the Atomic Scientists after the war

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,850
many of these physicists driven by a

39
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:48,860
sense of culpability for what they had

40
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:54,110
unleashed on the world became quite

41
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:57,140
politically active and well events like

42
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,720
the the unveiling of the Russell

43
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,920
Einstein manifesto I think really were a

44
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,899
landmark in activism among scientists

45
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,179
that particular one giving rise to the

46
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:10,550
Pugwash movement and eventually Joseph

47
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:15,080
Rotblat Snowbell Prize in Nobel Peace

48
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:17,620
Prize a second important historical

49
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,360
event was the Nuremberg trials

50
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,880
immediately after the conclusion of

51
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:28,579
world war ii remember that these trials

52
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:32,030
began with the prosecution of 20 fishing

53
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:37,120
researchers for experiments on humans

54
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,120
often quite macabre and routinely fatal

55
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:44,420
well the defense proffered that the

56
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,640
physicians were only doing their jobs

57
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,458
this was pretty much universally

58
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,048
rejected as both a legal and moral

59
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:57,350
argument and and many of the physicians

60
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:59,709
were in fact executed the third

61
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:02,840
historical event occurring during this

62
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,850
post-war Cold War period was the rise of

63
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,130
the environmental movement Rachel

64
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,590
Carson's book Silent Spring I think was

65
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:12,980
especially formative and she painted

66
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:17,269
this picture of man's future dystopia

67
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:19,399
not by going up in mushroom clouds but

68
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:21,560
by the kind of slow poisoning of our

69
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,420
environment through the overuse of

70
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:30,160
pesticide

71
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:34,060
I think in the rise of this new thinking

72
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,770
there appeared what one might consider a

73
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,349
kind of democratization of

74
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:41,319
responsibility scientists and engineers

75
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:43,000
had to be responsible for what they did

76
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,890
because if they didn't feel

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,410
responsibility we'd end up with this

78
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:51,040
world of Nightmare bombs and gas

79
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:54,540
chambers and human experiments and a

80
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,579
dying poisoned world I think there are

81
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,560
three basic tenets of this ethic of

82
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,930
responsibility for scientists and

83
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,590
engineers and the first of them is not

84
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:11,470
to use your work to contribute to social

85
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:13,750
harm the second precept is that you

86
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,970
actually should use your work in order

87
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,529
to contribute to the social good it's

88
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,000
not enough to do no harm but you're

89
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,309
actually supposed to do good with what

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,370
you know and the third precept is that

91
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,830
these two imperatives don't stem just

92
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:30,220
from your role as a human being but

93
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:32,940
actually stem as a consequence of your

94
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:37,479
specific training and professional role

95
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:39,640
in our case the obligations would stem

96
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,130
from are being cryptographers and

97
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,380
computer scientists and scientists and

98
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:49,719
technologists more generally depending

99
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:54,760
on how far outside you go and I believe

100
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,650
that by the 60s and 70s and 80s this had

101
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,330
this notion of an ethic of

102
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,390
responsibility for scientists engineers

103
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,700
had really become the doctrinal norm for

104
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:06,190
example professional codes of conduct

105
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,650
like the ACM code of ethics and the IC I

106
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,930
Triple E code of ethics would embody

107
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,179
this ethic of responsibility the first

108
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,970
two imperatives I listed are the first

109
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,460
two imperatives of the ACM code of

110
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,500
ethics there was a rise of

111
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,289
nongovernmental organizations things

112
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,960
like computer professionals for Social

113
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:30,759
Responsibility in the ef-s and

114
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:36,460
these organizations were were interested

115
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:38,729
in science being moral and I think you

116
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:43,810
could include among these organizations

117
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:46,740
the I ACR itself are our founding

118
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:52,319
purpose not only speaks of advancing

119
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:55,449
research in cryptography and and

120
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,580
promoting the interest of the IAC our

121
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:59,710
members but also serving the public

122
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,190
welfare this is also an important part

123
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:09,159
of our mission and in this light I think

124
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:12,719
the the figure of the the the good

125
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,520
scientist became a kind of cultural icon

126
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,550
Albert Einstein and Richard Feynman and

127
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,409
Carl Sagan and Jonas Salk these these

128
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,419
people were revered not only for their

129
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:25,750
scientific work but also because they

130
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:29,340
were seen as somehow deeply humanistic

131
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,340
in in their beliefs

132
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,880
and yet for all that I've said I don't

133
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,770
think that very many scientists and

134
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,080
engineers really took this ethic of

135
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:47,210
responsibility to heart let me give some

136
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,760
examples throughout the entire Cold War

137
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,440
period in the United States it was never

138
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,030
difficult to find the hundreds of

139
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,790
thousands of scientists and engineers

140
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,729
who were directly engaged in building

141
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:01,210
the munition systems that were that

142
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:04,520
we're killing people by the droves

143
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:08,419
universities like my own actually have

144
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,700
run nuclear weapons design labs for

145
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:14,810
years the University of California ran

146
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:16,370
all of the United States's nuclear

147
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:22,460
weapon all of the United States's

148
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:24,340
nuclear weapons design work when I speak

149
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,780
to students and I've been advising

150
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,289
undergraduate students for more than 20

151
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:35,630
years I've noticed that a concern for

152
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:39,590
the social obligations of the that they

153
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:42,469
may possess or the or the impact that

154
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,710
their potential employer asserts is

155
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:49,250
never a consideration in how they decide

156
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:52,310
on employment almost invariably it's a

157
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,440
question of high what I will get out of

158
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,540
this job and not what I will somehow

159
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:01,430
contribute to the world as a result of

160
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:05,330
my work in a kind of odd turn I think in

161
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:07,970
academia it's now become a common notion

162
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:12,349
that having a normative vision is

163
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:14,150
actually something inappropriate Stanley

164
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:17,240
fish a well-known literary critic

165
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:19,400
professor Indian advises professors to

166
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,270
stay far to keep their ethics far away

167
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,280
from from their academic work turning a

168
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,650
phrase of marks on its head he says our

169
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,250
job is not to save the world but to

170
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,250
interpret it

171
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:37,439
in the last few years as we've been

172
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:41,099
recruiting faculty members into my

173
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,640
department I always ask them to speak on

174
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:48,540
the social responsibility of scientists

175
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,819
and engineers many of them look at me

176
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,770
like you know a deer caught in the

177
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,580
headlights not quite sure what such a

178
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:58,470
question could even mean one data mining

179
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,220
candidate who came in a couple of years

180
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:05,670
ago and whose work seemed to me to be

181
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:09,000
this amalgamation of DoD funded work for

182
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,560
socially reprehensible purposes quickly

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,260
answered that she felt no social

184
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,900
responsibility whatsoever I'm a body

185
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,840
without a soul she said as though this

186
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:24,420
were somehow an okay thing to say and to

187
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:29,550
be but I guess none of this would

188
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:32,540
actually matter if well if if what we

189
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:35,430
did didn't implicate politics and

190
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:38,010
perhaps it doesn't certainly there are

191
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:40,829
lots of objects that directly implicate

192
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:43,470
politics I don't think anyone would

193
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,960
claim that objects like these I'm I'm

194
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,360
showing this is a stingray device that

195
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,940
pretends to be a cell phone tower and

196
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,800
vacuums up all of the cell calls in some

197
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,960
region they're used routinely by law

198
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,780
enforcement and by others this is a

199
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:01,380
drone control station so that the United

200
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:05,400
States can can can can kill Arabs from a

201
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,439
safe distance and this here is is a

202
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,810
brochure for a product by hacking team

203
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,670
that touts that they can monitor

204
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:15,030
hundreds of thousands of individuals

205
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,890
simultaneously no one would claim the

206
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,949
products like these are a political

207
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:23,610
because they're quite ostensibly

208
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:25,980
intended to to increase the power of

209
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,750
authority and yet you might think that

210
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,250
cryptography is different after all

211
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,700
cryptographic work can be quite

212
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:37,330
mathematical

213
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:40,399
if you open up the proceedings of a

214
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:44,000
conference like the ones today's it

215
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:46,040
looks about as political as as category

216
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,940
theory or something right it's not

217
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,770
Austen's ibly political so part of my

218
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,870
mission in today's talk is that I want

219
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:56,600
to show you that stuff like this

220
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:00,080
actually is political that it does

221
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,700
embody political sentiment maybe I

222
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,070
should say that when I speak of politics

223
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:11,980
today I'm really speaking of who has

224
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:17,480
what power in society the claim that

225
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:20,600
that cryptography is political well I

226
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,790
think you know in in some ways this is a

227
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,130
claim so obvious that only a

228
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,110
cryptographer might fail to see it but

229
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:31,070
but that's what we are so I should I

230
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:35,300
should justify it and I think part of

231
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:36,890
the part of the difficulty is that there

232
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,910
are multiple views of what the

233
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:42,709
cryptographer is to an outsider

234
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,959
well cryptography is probably that which

235
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:47,119
is depicted by the popular press in

236
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,689
movies like you know a beautiful mind

237
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,029
and sneakers and such and in the

238
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:56,120
fictional depictions of cryptography

239
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:58,279
well cryptographers are the brilliant

240
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,839
and handsome mathematicians that power

241
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:05,180
wants to have on its side I'm happy to

242
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:08,480
report that were these heroic figures

243
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,310
that almost always figure well in the

244
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,399
films a little crazy perhaps but I think

245
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,520
that just adds to the luster and

246
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:20,209
similarly the crypto hobbyist well he's

247
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:23,420
probably read books like those of David

248
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:26,300
Kahne or James Bamford which show quite

249
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,479
clearly that historically cryptography

250
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,729
is about power it's an area in which

251
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,050
governments spend and nor enormous sums

252
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:38,149
of money and not unwisely because

253
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,349
cryptography determines the outcomes of

254
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:44,800
wars

255
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:50,750
and cryptography also under grids

256
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:55,069
economic and political maneuverings but

257
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:57,710
I don't think that any of us would

258
00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:00,560
confuse these fictional or historical

259
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:04,430
depictions of cryptography with what we

260
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:08,270
actually do right we hack math hmm and

261
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:12,500
that doesn't seem very political at all

262
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:15,740
so so one explanation for why the

263
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,810
outsider might see cryptography as

264
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,070
political and the insider might see it

265
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,479
as not so at all is because of these two

266
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,850
archetypes of what the cryptographer is

267
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,740
is he some kind of art is he cuz some

268
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,920
kind of mathematician or some kind of

269
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,020
spy but I don't think this ultimately

270
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,449
explains very much you know for one

271
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:41,900
thing cryptography actually used to be

272
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:44,330
more political here's what Diffie

273
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,760
speaking at the new egg trial he's

274
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:49,850
talking of of his wife and he says I

275
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,280
told her that we were headed into a

276
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,890
world where people would have important

277
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,959
intimate long-term relationships with

278
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:59,540
people they had never met face to face I

279
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,910
was worried about privacy in that world

280
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:07,099
and that's why I was working on

281
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:09,350
cryptography and you know I believe I

282
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,210
believe what means this and in his

283
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,700
follow-on work and in his work with

284
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:15,050
Martin Hellman you see this evinced

285
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,480
again and again you know when their

286
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:20,000
concern for the key length of deaths or

287
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,800
in which book with Susan Lando on the

288
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,310
politics of wiretapping or in his

289
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,979
introduction of forward secrecy even

290
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:29,689
more Austin's ibly political is

291
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:33,560
basically the entire body of work by

292
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:36,769
David Chomp remember in 1981 he

293
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:40,790
introduced this notion of a mix net

294
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:44,139
in the paper on anonymous electron

295
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:47,509
anonymous electronic mail and throughout

296
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:50,869
throughout David's career he's spoken of

297
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:53,899
the socio-political aspects of

298
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:59,029
cryptography here in a CA cm article of

299
00:14:53,899 --> 00:15:01,639
1985 Tom writes the foundation is being

300
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:04,009
laid for a dossier society in which

301
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:06,499
computers could be used to infer

302
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:10,160
individuals lifestyles habits

303
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:12,049
whereabouts and associations from data

304
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,259
collected in ordinary consumer

305
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:18,949
transactions uncertainty about whether

306
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:22,129
data will remain secure against abuse by

307
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:24,079
those maintaining or tapping it can have

308
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:27,410
a chilling effect causing people to

309
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,998
alter their observable activities this

310
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:32,290
seems quite prescient for something

311
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:32,290
written in 1985

312
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:45,630
one illustration of how our community

313
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:48,540
has avoided the political is seen in

314
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:51,570
looking at what happened to Tom's body

315
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:55,380
of work particularly that induced by his

316
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:57,090
1981 paper on untraceable electronic

317
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,430
mail and comparing it with a

318
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:01,140
contemporary piece of work goldwasser

319
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,270
and McCulley's classic paper on

320
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,250
probabilistic encryption so both of

321
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,860
these papers appear at roughly the same

322
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:11,820
time and they actually have very similar

323
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,640
citation counts and yet where they went

324
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,950
really differed enormous ly you'll

325
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,850
recognize the venue's on the right here

326
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:23,880
where the Goldwasser McCully papers went

327
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,790
as as us right this is crypto and euro

328
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:30,360
crypt and such and the papers on the

329
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:33,449
left the papers that were most important

330
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,490
citing chums work well they actually

331
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,200
don't go to any coherent community to

332
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:41,250
community at all they've been kind of

333
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,750
scattered into the wind now you could

334
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,810
say well there's a simple explanation

335
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,820
for this phenomena that you know

336
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,339
goldwasser and McCulley's work was was

337
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:53,130
rigorous it was easy to kind of build a

338
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:55,200
science on top of it and Tom's work was

339
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:57,510
not particularly rigorous and that there

340
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,630
would be you know obstacles to creating

341
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,610
a scientific theory based on it I don't

342
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:08,430
think this explanation is valid at all

343
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:11,099
you know for one thing Tom's work would

344
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:13,260
in fact support rigor and the fact that

345
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,179
it wasn't provided from the beginning

346
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,369
and doesn't really imply much of

347
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,770
anything Diffie and Hellman --zz paper

348
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:22,020
didn't rigorously define trapdoor

349
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,480
permutations secure encryption or

350
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,220
digital signatures but nonetheless it

351
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,599
would be these notions would be very

352
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,820
quickly folded into the cryptographic

353
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,570
field coming at it from another

354
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,280
direction multi-party computation for

355
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:40,230
years and years lacked any sort of

356
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:42,090
rigorous definitions but yet to was was

357
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,390
embraced as a truly cryptographic

358
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:48,270
problem I think the real answer as to

359
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,870
why Toms legacy and goldwasser and

360
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,410
McCulley's

361
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:55,290
legacy split is much more

362
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:59,460
socio-political and in particular the

363
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:03,090
framing of problems within our world

364
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:07,590
within the flagship I see our

365
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:10,199
conferences is invariably scientific and

366
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:12,409
technical and the framing of the

367
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:17,070
problems that are being addressed in

368
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:21,540
Toms world is routinely social and

369
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:25,350
political and I believe our community is

370
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:29,428
much more comfortable with the one

371
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:32,309
framing than the other now there is a

372
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:35,610
community that has long lived at the

373
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:37,379
Nexus of cryptography and politics and

374
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,260
that of course are the cypherpunks

375
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,780
the cypherpunks emerged in the 1980s and

376
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,870
they believed that a key question of our

377
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:48,420
age was whether the state and corporate

378
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,639
interests would eviscerate Liberty

379
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,550
through electronic surveillance or if

380
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,110
instead the people would rise up and

381
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:58,980
protect themselves through the use of

382
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:01,439
cryptography it's actually cypherpunks

383
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,690
and not cryptographers who have been the

384
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,900
strongest advocates for the use of

385
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:09,660
cryptography for example here is Eric

386
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,059
Hughes writing back in 1993 we must

387
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,460
defend our privacy if we expect to have

388
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:16,080
any we must come together and create

389
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,690
systems which allow anonymous

390
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,879
transactions to take place we are

391
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:24,090
defending our privacy with cryptography

392
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,640
and here's a passage from Julian Assange

393
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:28,830
but we discovered something a strange

394
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,250
property of the physical universe in

395
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:34,800
which we live the universe believes in

396
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:38,130
encryption it is easier to encrypt

397
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,780
information than it is to decrypt it we

398
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,420
saw that we could use this strange

399
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:45,300
property to create the laws of a new

400
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,970
world and then finally here's Edward

401
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,590
Snowden I'm not sure if he's a cyberpunk

402
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,020
but here at least he's perfectly

403
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:55,199
reflecting cyberpunk discourse in which

404
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,210
he writes echoing Jefferson in words

405
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,160
from history let us speak no more of

406
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,040
faith in man

407
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,880
but bind him down from mischief by the

408
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:07,430
chains of cryptography you know when I

409
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,390
first started to encounter discourse

410
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:13,970
like this I felt kind of uncomfortable

411
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:17,210
you know for one thing it's not the way

412
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:18,320
cryptographers talked and for another it

413
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,570
seemed like they were kind of over

414
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,939
promising that you know there were all

415
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:26,689
these obstacles to the real use of

416
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:30,820
cryptography there was malware inside

417
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:34,700
channels and subversion and flaky hard

418
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:37,820
software and so on but what I've come to

419
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:40,400
appreciate is the top cypher punks

420
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,379
understand these limitations very well

421
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,830
they actually know a lot more about

422
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:48,430
building systems than I do and yet they

423
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:51,169
believe that despite these limitations

424
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:55,040
cryptography can still be formative in

425
00:20:51,170 --> 00:21:00,140
our er Kotak ting the politics of our

426
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:03,560
world and yet some of the cyberpunk

427
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:05,570
discourse seems to implicitly assume

428
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,030
that cryptography is going to favor the

429
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:10,100
weak and I want to make clear that

430
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,740
that's not necessarily true I'd like to

431
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:18,409
look at a few examples let's start off

432
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:24,200
with conventional encryption so one

433
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:26,930
reason yeah so you might think the

434
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,080
conventional encryption necessarily

435
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:31,730
empowers the the weak but it very much

436
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,439
depends on how the encryption is used

437
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,350
right the encryption has to be

438
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:44,300
architected into some system and if the

439
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:47,090
system is is a content provider for

440
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:49,970
example flowing a film in such a manner

441
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:51,679
that it can only be decrypted by you

442
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,140
know within a software or Hardware

443
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,960
boundary that the user has no realistic

444
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,850
access to it then you have not empowered

445
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,740
the user or customer here you've

446
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,959
empowered the content provider and

447
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,980
similarly if you architect a

448
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,299
cryptographic system in

449
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:11,880
which the NSA has access to escrowed

450
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:13,820
keys then again you haven't empowered

451
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,640
the individuals you've empowered

452
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:19,470
Authority so you could just throw up

453
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,210
your hands and say well even for

454
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,850
something like encryption it all depends

455
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,410
on the subsequent architecture and yet I

456
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:28,559
don't think this is the right view I

457
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:30,179
think the cryptography the particular

458
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,030
cryptographic problems do have

459
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:36,660
tendencies and the tendency for

460
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:39,178
encryption I do believe is to support

461
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,370
the empowering of ordinary people after

462
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:43,460
all encryption directly supports freedom

463
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:46,290
of speech it doesn't require expensive

464
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:49,140
or difficult to difficult to obtain

465
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:52,799
resources it's enabled by a thing that's

466
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:55,890
easily shared an individual can at least

467
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,799
in principle refused to use backdoors

468
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:03,510
technology and even the customary

469
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:05,750
language of encryption imagines this

470
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:08,580
world in which ordinary people are

471
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,380
afforded the privilege of secure

472
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,510
communication right the Alice's and

473
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,429
Bob's of the world are to be so

474
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:18,290
privileged and coming at it from the

475
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:21,360
other direction when we do try to use

476
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:23,428
encryption as a way to prop up Authority

477
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,629
we encounter lots of architectural

478
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:30,660
problems you know Clipper Chip failed

479
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:33,929
quite miserably and trusted computing

480
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:36,510
didn't fare much better in the end

481
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:39,559
I think conventional encryption does

482
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:41,910
support this does have this tendency to

483
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:43,530
to support the weak let's look at

484
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:47,100
identity based encryption

485
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:49,590
IBE the aim here is to allow a party to

486
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,820
use an email address for example as a

487
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:56,580
public key seems a wonderful convenience

488
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:59,220
but what is often under emphasized is

489
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:01,409
that this convenience is achieved

490
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,320
through a radical change in the trust

491
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:07,230
model a user's secret key is no longer

492
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:11,490
self issued it's issued by a trusted

493
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:12,640
Authority IBE embeds key escrow write

494
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,290
and eat it in bed

495
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,370
particularly strong form of key escrow

496
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:21,100
where the F growing Authority is able to

497
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,719
obtain not only all keys presently

498
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:26,350
issued but all to be issued in the

499
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,600
future and even if you do trust that

500
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,310
trusted Authority a state-level

501
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:35,370
adversary now has an extremely

502
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:37,960
attractive target to subvert right

503
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,820
descriptions of I ve rarely emphasized

504
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,440
this change in trust model and the

505
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,240
trusted Authority never seems to be

506
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,820
called something like that right it's

507
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,920
usually the PKG or public key generator

508
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:52,990
that sounds more like an algorithm than

509
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:55,060
an entity and in papers even that entity

510
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:58,420
vanishes further into the background

511
00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:00,610
because in the formulation an ibe scheme

512
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,890
will be a couple of algorithms and the

513
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:05,860
entities that conceptually live behind

514
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:08,380
those algorithms play no role in any

515
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:13,570
formal theory finally let's think about

516
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:15,340
fully homomorphic encryption in brief

517
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,470
fully homomorphic encryption allows you

518
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:20,500
to outsource your data encrypted under a

519
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,630
public key that you own to a service

520
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,610
provider who can then compute whatever

521
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:27,250
you ask of yet returning to the

522
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,990
decrypted answer and it doesn't have any

523
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,940
idea what its computed but you decrypt

524
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:33,100
and learn it from a political

525
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,290
perspective this sounds utopian right

526
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,659
this sounds great your your

527
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,639
disempowering the powerful entity and

528
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:44,320
avoiding this kind of Faustian bargain

529
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:46,090
that underlies cloud computing but I

530
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,850
would say this analysis is completely

531
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:51,970
specious because it's quite speculative

532
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:54,429
if fhe will ever evolve into something

533
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,200
practically useful and if you want to

534
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:59,260
assess the political leanings of

535
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,120
something that is really so speculative

536
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:03,550
you shouldn't just assume that it'll

537
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,610
give rise to the counted applications

538
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:10,520
you should focus I think on what it does

539
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:13,100
to us in the in the here-and-now

540
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:19,160
and there in the story looks quite

541
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:22,730
different I would say that fhe have

542
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:26,210
produced plenty of excitement but

543
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:29,059
nothing of positive value to privacy and

544
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,920
in media interviews and talks leading

545
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:33,070
theorists and program managers talk

546
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,570
about the game-changing nature of this

547
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:40,149
mathematics but nobody seems to

548
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:43,490
emphasize just how speculative it is or

549
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:46,160
emphasize our vanishing privacy or are

550
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:48,110
lousy computer security and I think this

551
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,740
has consequences you know it misleads

552
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:54,080
the public into where exactly we stand

553
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:57,320
right now and it shifts financial

554
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,470
resources away from areas more likely to

555
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:03,040
have social utility and it encourages

556
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:06,400
bright young researchers to work in

557
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,559
fundamentally impractical directions and

558
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,230
perhaps worst of all it provides cover

559
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:15,770
to the strongest opponents of privacy

560
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:17,750
namely intelligence agencies who can say

561
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:20,780
how they are working hard to create a

562
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:24,380
more secure world while actually nothing

563
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:28,450
threatening is being done towards the

564
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,450
the antithetical interests

565
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:37,959
in the end I think it helps keep

566
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:39,580
harmless academics harmless of course

567
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,289
none of this matters if mass

568
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,789
surveillance isn't really a threat to us

569
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:44,080
if there's nothing we can really do

570
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:47,620
about it or if there's nothing we can

571
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,020
really do about it and I guess I lived

572
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:52,779
my life kind of implicitly assuming this

573
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:55,029
until that summer of 2013 when somehow

574
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:58,480
all of this stuff really started to

575
00:27:55,029 --> 00:28:00,970
capture my attention and I would read

576
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,380
the news stories and the underlying

577
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:07,330
primary documents quite religiously

578
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:13,720
producing I think much more stress than

579
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:17,470
insight and it was very complicated a

580
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,720
year into the revelations ProPublica and

581
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:24,010
the ACLU produced this lovely chart of

582
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:26,289
the 54 programs and revelations that

583
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:28,240
they thought were most important to have

584
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:29,980
come out in the prior year I hope that

585
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,450
helped clarify everything that's

586
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:36,039
actually going on so it doesn't of

587
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,620
course right I mean there's there's too

588
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:41,020
much here and when you scratch the

589
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:43,360
surface you actually still don't know

590
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:47,230
much because the details of these these

591
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:51,418
programs remain quite obscure and what I

592
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:55,630
finally realized is that this complexity

593
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:58,299
it is itself an application of

594
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:00,820
tradecraft the the combination of

595
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:04,750
extreme complexity and extreme secrecy

596
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:09,610
is is this really toxic mix that keeps

597
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:12,190
us from from making good progress or

598
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:14,699
even intelligently criticizing what's

599
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,700
going on

600
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,809
and I really think we don't understand

601
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:23,230
what's going on and that that is perhaps

602
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:25,480
the primary insight gained by this

603
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,039
mountain of Snowden revelations and when

604
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,590
I say we don't understand I mean it at a

605
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:33,519
quite basic level you know I pick up the

606
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:35,080
phone and call me here I have no idea

607
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,649
how many copies of this communication

608
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:40,809
are kept or where they're kept I have no

609
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:43,779
idea what sort of data analytics are

610
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:45,850
being performed on it now or in the

611
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:50,049
future right because this may be

612
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:52,658
maintained and mind years hence I have

613
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:55,480
no idea what other pieces of information

614
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:56,859
our call will be combined with and I

615
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,409
don't know if this is going to somehow

616
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:04,449
trigger a human analyst at some point

617
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:07,809
what I say or a tax audit or or some

618
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:10,859
Hoover style dirty-tricks really it's a

619
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:14,649
mystery it's made the telephone a

620
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:16,678
frightful object I don't have a cell

621
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:16,678
phone

622
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:27,820
I think that there's another problem and

623
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:31,720
that's that when we think about where we

624
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:34,689
stand we often fall victim to this

625
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,309
extraordinarily effective framing by law

626
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:41,380
enforcement on what the underlying

627
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:43,389
problem is so the law enforcement

628
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,460
framing says the privacy is a personal

629
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:47,500
good that it's about your desire to

630
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,000
control the personal information about

631
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,220
you and that security on the other hand

632
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,200
is this collective good and it's about

633
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,149
living in a safe and secure world and

634
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,220
that unfortunately these two things live

635
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:59,529
in conflict and that we have to find the

636
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:03,870
right balance and that modern technology

637
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:06,700
has been a boon to one side to the

638
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:09,129
privacy side at the expense of the

639
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,769
security side and because of this bad

640
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:13,570
guys are gonna win the bad guys they're

641
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:14,139
very bad they're terrorists and they're

642
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:16,210
murderers

643
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:21,399
and there are money launderers and

644
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:24,039
they're there child pornographers and we

645
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:27,610
now run the risk of going dark where our

646
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:31,210
world will essentially be like like

647
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:34,658
locked closets everywhere it's a it's a

648
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:37,389
beautifully crafted public relations

649
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:40,570
campaign that works very well with

650
00:31:37,389 --> 00:31:44,229
underlying human fears right implicit in

651
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:46,960
this is fear of crime fear of losing our

652
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:51,490
parents protection and even fear of the

653
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,320
dark and there's a completely different

654
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:56,529
framing of course I'll call this the

655
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,120
surveillance studies framing not doing

656
00:31:56,529 --> 00:32:00,519
justice of course to the enormous

657
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:03,399
variety of different views within the

658
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:05,080
surveillance studies but among the

659
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:07,090
commonly heard tenants are that

660
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,199
surveillance is an instrument of power

661
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:13,260
it's an apparatus of control and that

662
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,150
power in particular doesn't have to be

663
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:19,140
in your face to be effective that often

664
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:22,770
the most the most useful forms of power

665
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:24,600
are exercised quite subtly also that

666
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:26,460
while surveillance is nothing new

667
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,810
technological changes have given

668
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,690
governments and corporations an

669
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:34,139
unprecedented capacity to monitor

670
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:37,230
everyone and furthermore the marginal

671
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:40,980
cost of monitoring just one more person

672
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:42,900
has has gone to nearly zero governmental

673
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:46,320
surveillance is strongly tied to cyber

674
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:49,290
war and to conventional war and that the

675
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,530
agencies and individuals in charge of

676
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:55,620
one at least in the United States are

677
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:58,230
usually in charge of the other that law

678
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,260
enforcement framing is wrong when it

679
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:03,480
pits privacy as a personal good and not

680
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:05,879
a social good because privacy routinely

681
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,680
is also a social good and that

682
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,080
furthermore it goes wrong in viewing

683
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,270
these two things is in conflict when at

684
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:18,500
least is often privacy and security

685
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:18,500
support one another quite well that mass

686
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:24,409
that mass surveillance in particular

687
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:27,480
tends to produce people that are kind of

688
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:30,240
conformant fearful and ultimately boring

689
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:35,430
and at a sociological level it stifles

690
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,750
dissent and finally that crypt that

691
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:39,120
surveillance is something that's going

692
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:42,240
to be very hard to stop because of the

693
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,939
confluence of interests here and that

694
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,690
our field cryptography offers at least a

695
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,690
little bit of help

696
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:57,730
I'd like to comment that from my reading

697
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:00,529
of the literature excessive surveillance

698
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:03,080
routinely perhaps inevitably becomes

699
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:05,260
political surveillance I'm including

700
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,389
here a copy of the suicide letter

701
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:10,639
famously produced by the FBI trying to

702
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:12,050
encourage Martin Luther King to commit

703
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,849
suicide

704
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:18,320
accompanied by audio tapes of

705
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:21,800
extramarital affairs of his and and some

706
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,720
student activists during the 1960's u.s.

707
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,089
universities were thoroughly infiltrated

708
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:32,029
with informants who reported to their

709
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:34,909
FBI handlers more recently surveillance

710
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:37,280
has become a tool for assassinations for

711
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:40,099
imprisoning dissidents and surveillance

712
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,310
combined or as an implicit part of what

713
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:49,030
sometimes called Miami model policing

714
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:52,639
has become important in ensuring that

715
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:54,830
that protests are a very intimidating

716
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,050
thing to go to nowadays you will be

717
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:59,540
photographed your cell phone's monitor

718
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:01,609
your car license monitored and then

719
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:04,960
you'll be put in a cage tear gassed and

720
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:04,960
rubber bullets fired at you

721
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:12,680
and yet I don't want to suggest that all

722
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:15,190
of these intellectual reasons are in

723
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:19,839
some sense what really undergirds are

724
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:23,030
are my disdain of mass surveillance

725
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:25,100
Bruce Schneier in his typically 50 Way

726
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,170
says animals don't like to be surveilled

727
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,750
because it makes them feel like prey

728
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:33,920
well it makes the surveil or feel like

729
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:36,770
and act like a predator I think in an

730
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,880
instinctual level we know that constant

731
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:42,590
monitoring is something that is not

732
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:45,770
consistent with a desirable end of the

733
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:50,120
human condition so what can we actually

734
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:53,000
do about it well I think one useful way

735
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:58,640
of conceptualizing it was provided by

736
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:00,260
Arvin Narayanan's taxonomy of I guess

737
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,819
it's really applied cryptography where

738
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,210
he viewed cryptography is being

739
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:07,310
partitioned into crypto for security and

740
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:11,150
crypto for privacy crypto for security

741
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:13,340
is cryptography that benefits commercial

742
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:15,190
interests the benefits benefits commerce

743
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:21,530
it's the kind of cryptography that's in

744
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:23,960
GSM phones or SSL cryptography for

745
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:26,510
privacy crypto for privacy is the kind

746
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,030
of crypto that intends to have social or

747
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:36,850
political ends it's the sort of crypto

748
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:36,850
that's in that's in tor or or or signal

749
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,569
Maryana suggests the crypto for security

750
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,940
is done great that it actually has

751
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:47,799
worked well to secure our world to an

752
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,520
adequate extent that commerce is

753
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:51,509
thriving

754
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:55,240
whereas crypto for privacy has been

755
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:55,720
really a failure and I think he's right

756
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,140
about that

757
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,720
I'd like to enhance his taxonomy just a

758
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:04,629
bit though by saying that most of what

759
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,879
we do isn't really well characterized as

760
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:11,170
crypto for security or crypto for

761
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:16,410
privacy it's kind of crypto for crypto

762
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:20,040
and you know by this I mean that it it

763
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:22,980
advances the it continues the program

764
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:28,270
worked out by cryptographers but has no

765
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:30,309
obvious it's not clear that it'll

766
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:33,220
eventually help crypto for security or

767
00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:34,869
crypto for privacy and at some level I

768
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,939
believe that every field eventually

769
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:38,920
becomes a little bit self you know

770
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,260
inward looking and that some degree of

771
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,190
this is actually necessary but I think

772
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,940
in cryptography

773
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:49,799
if you become excessively inward looking

774
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:52,540
then well this actually starves out an

775
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:54,670
important social need which in this case

776
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:57,369
is crypto for privacy

777
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:59,799
I think crypto for crypto has blossomed

778
00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:02,109
to such an extent and we're a very small

779
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:05,640
community that there's not a whole lot

780
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:05,640
left for crypto for privacy

781
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:10,619
so I wanted to give you a couple of

782
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:12,419
examples of problems I'm running later

783
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,579
than my notes say I should be running so

784
00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:16,949
I'll be very brief this is a problem

785
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:18,929
it's still very formative that I've been

786
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:20,519
thinking about and I hear I'm just

787
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:24,419
trying to give you a few examples of

788
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:26,549
crypto for privacy problems okay

789
00:38:24,419 --> 00:38:28,709
ones that you you won't have no notes

790
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:32,309
because they're new

791
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:38,578
so here Alice wants to send a message to

792
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:40,380
Bob an email let's say but big brother

793
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:42,809
is watching all of the communications

794
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:45,089
okay so how can you effectively do this

795
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:49,559
it's very difficult to do nowadays in

796
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:51,328
fact even the the the Mixmaster kind of

797
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:55,650
cypherpunk creations are no longer

798
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:59,069
operational so here's a suggestion for a

799
00:38:55,650 --> 00:39:01,319
high level architecture the alice drops

800
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:04,199
her encrypted mail to this untrusted

801
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:06,749
server acts that's how she sends a mail

802
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:10,679
to bob and when bob is ready to receive

803
00:39:06,749 --> 00:39:13,169
his mail well i skipped a step so the

804
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:15,390
server X just retains what's given to it

805
00:39:13,169 --> 00:39:17,489
of course when the server is ready to

806
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:20,239
receive his mail he makes a request to

807
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:23,429
the server based on his secret key

808
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:26,519
but this doesn't reveal his identity in

809
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:31,079
any way the server responds with some

810
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:34,348
value s from which Bob should be able to

811
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:37,439
recover his request depended on a value

812
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:40,229
I should be able to recover the message

813
00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:42,928
M if M happened to be the ithe message

814
00:39:40,229 --> 00:39:44,609
that was addressed to him and if it's

815
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:47,219
not he'll recover an indication that

816
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:49,259
there was no such AI message this is the

817
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:51,539
bowl if you had no concern for

818
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:55,319
efficiency it would be possible to solve

819
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:57,509
by providing to be the entire database

820
00:39:55,319 --> 00:40:00,569
one would like to do better than that

821
00:39:57,509 --> 00:40:02,669
and I've been working on a a practice

822
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:04,079
oriented provable security treatment for

823
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:05,930
this problem and protocols that

824
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,150
hopefully will do better

825
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:13,560
here is another problem that I like in

826
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:16,890
kind of crypto for privacy and it

827
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:19,590
attempts to deal with apts advanced

828
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:21,870
persistent threats that might be sitting

829
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:24,240
on your system it's a nice explanation

830
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:27,680
of the problem that I think I'll skip

831
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:32,279
reading from Audie from panel discussion

832
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:34,319
at RSA a couple of years ago okay so we

833
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,490
want to create keys that are enormous Li

834
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:41,160
long so that if a adversary is trying to

835
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,910
exfiltrate them it'll have its work cut

836
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,560
out for it

837
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:46,410
nonetheless we want to make sure that

838
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,450
these long keys don't make impractical

839
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,230
the cryptography that you're basing on

840
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:51,689
them

841
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:57,420
we need fast operations that deal with

842
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:59,850
long keys and what bellari Kayne and

843
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,140
myself have have found is that there is

844
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:04,049
really a fascinating information

845
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:07,020
theoretic problem that underlies this

846
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:10,950
you have this enormous lis long key K

847
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:13,050
and you let the adversary learn fewer

848
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:14,640
bits about it terabyte of key I let the

849
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:16,920
adversary learn half a terabyte of

850
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,490
information computed in any way it likes

851
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,980
about it at that point I point to P

852
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:26,069
randomly chosen positions on the key and

853
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,470
ask the adversary to predict all of

854
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:31,740
those values okay what's the best the

855
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:35,160
adversary can do and we've been able to

856
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:36,899
analyze this quite precisely and the

857
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,330
approximate answer if the adversary

858
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,510
could learn half the keys is is this

859
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:45,420
that it scales inverse exponentially

860
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:47,760
with a strange constant that depends on

861
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,310
the fraction of leakage and the binary

862
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,530
entropy function and there's lots more

863
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:54,600
interesting crypto for privacy problems

864
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:59,060
and I've listed a few of them here that

865
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:01,890
I really like you know going beyond the

866
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:04,520
the most obvious examples of mixing ad

867
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,520
and Tor and Bitcoin

868
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:11,868
my first imperative then that I'd like

869
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:14,058
to suggest is that you should really

870
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:17,029
attend to problems social values at

871
00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:19,099
least some of the time and do this kind

872
00:42:17,029 --> 00:42:20,930
of style of anti-surveillance research

873
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:23,089
that this was a good activity for

874
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:26,169
cryptography and that it won't lead to

875
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:28,759
stuff that's necessarily boring that

876
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:31,940
that there's really fascinating problems

877
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:34,579
that have social utility as one of their

878
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,789
consequences I'd also like to say that

879
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:39,890
in speaking with cryptographers about

880
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:43,460
why they're working on what they're

881
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:46,430
working on I often hear answers that are

882
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:48,680
extraordinarily unconvincing you know

883
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:50,808
that people are doing are working on the

884
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,868
problem they're working on because

885
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:57,019
ultimately they know how to do this kind

886
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:58,640
of work and it gets published and people

887
00:42:57,019 --> 00:43:00,919
have done this sort of work before and

888
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,808
you know these are bad reasons to be

889
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,539
spending your life on something so I

890
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:09,279
encourage you to really be introspective

891
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:11,930
about your problem selection and

892
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:13,970
introspection takes time and we seem to

893
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:17,390
have a culture in which there's never

894
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:20,238
enough time I think it's okay for people

895
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:23,538
to be writing fewer papers I think as a

896
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:25,999
community we should be producing a lot

897
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:27,920
fewer papers and trying to produce

898
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:30,680
papers of more relevance and

899
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:34,339
particularly some papers of significant

900
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:36,230
social relevance another suggestion I'd

901
00:43:34,339 --> 00:43:39,140
like to make is that it's not only what

902
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:41,630
problems you consider but somehow how

903
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:44,739
you approach them and I think the

904
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:47,269
approach that mahir and I have been

905
00:43:44,739 --> 00:43:49,309
practicing and advocating for a very

906
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:51,738
long time what we call practice oriented

907
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:54,589
provable security is a promising

908
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:58,880
approach for dealing with anti

909
00:43:54,589 --> 00:44:01,460
surveillance technologies and I will try

910
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,009
and justify that precisely the the two

911
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:06,650
problems that I just described as recent

912
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:09,380
work are both done in this framework and

913
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:12,200
I'd like to suggest applying practice

914
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:14,980
Oregon to prove Abul security not just

915
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,649
to crypto for security

916
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:21,190
Arvin's language but for crypto for

917
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:23,349
privacy there are a lot of aspects to

918
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:24,940
practice-oriented provable security and

919
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:26,829
it's a completely different talk to try

920
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:29,140
and explain them but I think I'd like to

921
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:32,800
mention a little bit on this last one

922
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:35,549
this kind of condemned Natori attitude I

923
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:43,510
routinely feel towards non-standard

924
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:45,579
models there's really been a quite

925
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:48,430
extraordinary disciplinary narrowing of

926
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:50,859
our field you know whole areas of

927
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:54,009
inquiry things like traffic analysis and

928
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:56,529
information hiding and symbolic models

929
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:59,470
and logical models and connections to

930
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:01,359
programming languages and many more

931
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:04,450
areas have been kind of pushed to the

932
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:07,029
margin not really considered a core part

933
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:09,549
of cryptography this is entirely a

934
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:12,880
social construct right

935
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:14,680
these things are cryptographic when one

936
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,320
thinks about what cryptography is

937
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:22,480
supposed to entail and I would like to

938
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:25,450
encourage people to be to be open about

939
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:31,780
other models and other ways of looking

940
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:33,430
at problems sometimes it it verges even

941
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:35,800
on silliness like when people won't use

942
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:39,970
the word proof for a proof in the random

943
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:42,130
Oracle model you know all proofs in

944
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:45,450
cryptography are proof with respect to

945
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:49,569
some particular model and definition and

946
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:51,848
those models and definitions should

947
00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:53,950
always be viewed as suspect not just in

948
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:56,740
that case but in all cases where we give

949
00:45:53,950 --> 00:46:00,848
definitions in cryptography and we

950
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:03,759
should understand that models are very

951
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:06,490
much and definitions are very much a

952
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,130
dialectical inquiry I like this quote of

953
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:11,589
George box he's a famous statistician he

954
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:15,220
says all models are useful all models

955
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:16,960
are wrong but some are useful and in

956
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:19,750
cryptography I'm afraid it's very hard

957
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,850
to ascertain utility maybe even harder

958
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:25,640
than in statistics

959
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:29,779
because because the definitional

960
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:31,790
enterprise in cryptography kind of sits

961
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:34,100
at the juncture of of math and

962
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:36,440
aesthetics and philosophy and culture

963
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:40,420
and the artifacts that are eventually

964
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:46,670
produced and in my view so situated and

965
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:48,890
Dogma is is disease I want to talk a

966
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:52,010
little bit about military funding to

967
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:55,150
cryptography and I apologize that this

968
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:59,930
and the next couple of slides are are

969
00:46:55,150 --> 00:47:02,420
very much from a u.s. perspective it's

970
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:05,180
hard to ascertain the percentage of

971
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:07,790
cryptographic work nowadays which is

972
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:10,190
funded by the military I can't find any

973
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:12,380
sort of composite numbers but it

974
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:15,860
certainly seems to be escalating this

975
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:22,720
chart shows the percentage of papers at

976
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:26,240
crypto that acknowledge you as funding

977
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:30,439
that include among that us funding DoD

978
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:34,189
funding and in the period from like 2000

979
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:37,040
to 2010 it's under 15% on average and in

980
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:39,500
the period from 2012 to 2015 it's over

981
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,590
65% okay so there's been this huge

982
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:44,600
increase it seems in the fraction of

983
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:47,540
papers that are getting for

984
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:49,880
acknowledging DoD funding and DoD grants

985
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:53,090
tend to be much larger than NSF grants

986
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,950
so my expectation is the most funding in

987
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:57,470
the United States nowadays actually is

988
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:59,419
coming from the military and I think

989
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:02,180
this is actually inherently corrupting

990
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:05,750
and in ways that people don't want to

991
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:07,129
acknowledge or talk about a lot of

992
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,050
people think that they can take their

993
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:11,450
money from anybody and it won't affect

994
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:14,210
them because they're better than that

995
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:15,529
and I think this is a very naive view of

996
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:18,980
things

997
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:21,170
our sponsors change our values in ways

998
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:24,140
that we don't necessarily see and they

999
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:27,860
also reflect our values and the values

1000
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:30,460
of the military funding agencies well

1001
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:33,890
they're definitely not my own values

1002
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:36,350
your DARP I think it's the largest DoD

1003
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:39,620
source of funding in the United States

1004
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:42,980
almost certainly and here's DARPA s--

1005
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:45,529
mission these agencies don't hide their

1006
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:47,690
their purpose DARPA the mission is to

1007
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:50,270
invest in the breakthrough technologies

1008
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:53,240
that can create the next generation of

1009
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:56,980
US national security capabilities they

1010
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:59,689
also speak often having been born

1011
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:02,780
following Sputnik of avoiding

1012
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:07,550
technological surprise and in creating

1013
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:09,380
surprise for America's enemies I would

1014
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:11,780
like to suggest that if the

1015
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:14,180
institutional values of those that are

1016
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:16,700
funding you are fundamentally at odds

1017
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:23,089
with your own values then you probably

1018
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:26,180
shouldn't be taking their money funding

1019
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:29,930
in cryptography as it is throughout the

1020
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:33,560
sciences is used to redirect it in in

1021
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:35,839
the directions that power wants and it

1022
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:39,020
would seem that the directions that the

1023
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:40,820
NSA likes and NSA advises all military

1024
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:43,730
agencies in the United States at least

1025
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:45,560
about cryptographic funding the

1026
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:50,270
direction that the NSA seems to prefer

1027
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:55,490
is to have not very useful work again to

1028
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:57,350
keep harmless cryptographers I'm sure

1029
00:49:55,490 --> 00:50:01,729
many of you have seen these quotes from

1030
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:06,140
the lovely Europe 92 trip report that

1031
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:08,420
that was released under a Freedom of

1032
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:10,490
Information Act inquiry I'll rerun one

1033
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:13,100
or two three of the four last sessions

1034
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:14,779
were of no value whatever and indeed

1035
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:18,450
there was almost nothing at Euro Crypt

1036
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:21,089
to interest us this is good news

1037
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:23,339
there were no proposals of cryptosystems

1038
00:50:21,089 --> 00:50:25,470
no novel cryptanalysis of old designs

1039
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:27,599
even very little on hardware design I

1040
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:31,140
really don't see how things could have

1041
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:34,160
been better for our purposes my own

1042
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:36,960
experience with the NSA was that when I

1043
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:41,520
when I was to receive my career award

1044
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,150
back in 1994 the NSA apparently tried to

1045
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,109
kill it

1046
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:48,300
the NSF program director felt kind of

1047
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:50,970
offended by what she viewed as in this

1048
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:54,000
inappropriate request and not only said

1049
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:56,459
no but picked up the phone to tell me I

1050
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,109
think we should all strive to be doing

1051
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:03,060
work that the NSA would like to kill my

1052
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:04,950
conclusions are to think twice and then

1053
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:07,619
maybe one more time about accepting

1054
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:11,189
military funding make sure it's actually

1055
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:13,589
consistent with your values and more

1056
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:16,349
than that to regard ordinary people as

1057
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:20,099
those whose needs you ultimately aim to

1058
00:51:16,349 --> 00:51:23,150
to satisfy with your work most of us I

1059
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:26,310
think are trying to satisfy one another

1060
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:28,800
yes it's kind of the the paradigm in

1061
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:32,730
crypto for crypto and beyond that I

1062
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:36,240
think we've often internalized that that

1063
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:39,180
we'd like to make the world somehow a

1064
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:42,419
safer place for electronic commerce or

1065
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:45,649
for other commercial interests these

1066
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,650
aren't the only values

1067
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:54,109
you know there's this long tradition in

1068
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:56,630
cryptography of cutesy nests we often

1069
00:51:54,109 --> 00:51:58,069
spin kind of fanciful tales to explain

1070
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:01,010
the cryptographic problems we've

1071
00:51:58,069 --> 00:52:05,509
imagined my personal favorites usually

1072
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:09,290
involves space aliens and in in-flight

1073
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:11,180
presentations it's routine too to depict

1074
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:14,119
our adversaries like this little fellow

1075
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:18,890
a cute devil with with horns and maybe a

1076
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:21,710
pitchfork and a tail I've never liked

1077
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:23,990
this but I think after the the Snowden

1078
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:26,890
Revolution revelations it it really

1079
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:30,040
started to vex me in in a new way

1080
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:33,500
you know crypto is actually quite hard

1081
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:38,000
hard to understand at least for me and I

1082
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:40,880
think that when we try to use these kind

1083
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,950
of cutesy approaches to explaining our

1084
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,760
results we don't make it easier to

1085
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:45,980
understand

1086
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,099
we actually just add this kind of extra

1087
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:52,309
layer of obfuscation and we kind of send

1088
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:53,869
this implicit message that I'm so smart

1089
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:56,660
that I don't have to even think about

1090
00:52:53,869 --> 00:53:00,680
actual human concerns my problems are

1091
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:02,210
entirely are entirely made up and it's

1092
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:05,690
it's worse than that because I think

1093
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:09,200
this cartoon heavy cryptography kind of

1094
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:12,020
reshaped our internal vision of who the

1095
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,390
adversary is if we're thinking about our

1096
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:16,670
adversary as a cute fellow with a

1097
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:19,098
pitchfork and if we're thinking of our

1098
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:22,579
adversary as a fifty three billion

1099
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:24,799
dollar military intelligence complex we

1100
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:27,079
will see the world in a very different

1101
00:53:24,799 --> 00:53:29,720
way and the kind of problems we will

1102
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:32,510
come up with there will be very

1103
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:34,520
different problems so I'd like to

1104
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:36,770
suggest that we should stop with the

1105
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:41,480
cutesy pictures and we should take our

1106
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:44,270
adversaries really quite seriously and I

1107
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:47,210
think we should in particular try to

1108
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:50,030
figure out what research is going to

1109
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:53,180
frustrate adversaries like the NSA and

1110
00:53:50,030 --> 00:54:04,160
GCHQ and we should do some of it

1111
00:53:53,180 --> 00:54:07,490
I have several more suggestions you know

1112
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:09,348
many of us are academics and at least

1113
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:12,229
post-tenure were supposed to be able to

1114
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:16,339
do whatever we damn please this is not

1115
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:18,800
frequently exercised and in fact

1116
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:21,380
throughout most of the sciences it seems

1117
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:24,230
that it's not that academic freedom is

1118
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:28,160
not maybe even very necessary or

1119
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:30,290
important but here we are in an area you

1120
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,359
know anti-surveillance research if you

1121
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:34,130
want to think of it that way for which

1122
00:54:32,359 --> 00:54:38,630
academic freedom I think is actually

1123
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:41,420
useful and academic freedom if not

1124
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:44,450
exercised is going to wither and die

1125
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:47,150
it's already very much in decline I

1126
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:51,339
think we do a social good when we

1127
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:51,339
exercise our academic freedom here

1128
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:59,450
you know I remember reading this paper

1129
00:54:57,289 --> 00:55:01,730
by Dan Bonet and his students the most

1130
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:04,640
dangerous code in the world I don't know

1131
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:07,700
if how many of you have seen it in which

1132
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:12,710
he describes this kind of universe of

1133
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:14,410
middleware that that can subvert you

1134
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:17,299
know the verification of cryptographic

1135
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:20,089
certificates the most cryptographers and

1136
00:55:17,299 --> 00:55:23,319
security people assumed to be present

1137
00:55:20,089 --> 00:55:26,509
and I remember feeling the sense that

1138
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:28,700
that there existed this big piece of

1139
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:34,640
stuff out there that I didn't even know

1140
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:37,098
the existence of that was really highly

1141
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:40,450
relevant to our communications ecosystem

1142
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:43,309
as a whole when the Snowden revelations

1143
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:45,578
began to come out and people started to

1144
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:48,980
speculate about how they might be

1145
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:52,970
subverted this or that it occurred to me

1146
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:55,910
that to a large extent power probably

1147
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:58,910
doesn't need clever cryptanalysis or

1148
00:55:55,910 --> 00:56:01,520
even social engineering they just need

1149
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:04,129
to get a good system's level view about

1150
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:07,190
what's actually going on insist in in

1151
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:08,510
the real communication architecture and

1152
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:12,440
then just break the things that are

1153
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:14,450
obviously wrong I'd like to encourage

1154
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,690
people especially young people who are

1155
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:20,058
still highly plastic to try to get this

1156
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:22,369
system's level view which I understand

1157
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:23,829
is not easy to get but which I'm sure

1158
00:56:22,369 --> 00:56:27,490
can lead to much more relevant

1159
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:27,490
cryptographic work

1160
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:36,979
I think we should be using privacy tools

1161
00:56:31,069 --> 00:56:39,380
very few of us do yeah I think this is

1162
00:56:36,979 --> 00:56:42,558
an instance of the both the pot calling

1163
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:44,930
the kettle black I never used PGP I just

1164
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:48,229
recently started using tor and so on

1165
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:51,979
but I think we pay a significant price

1166
00:56:48,229 --> 00:56:55,879
for not ourselves being users of this

1167
00:56:51,979 --> 00:56:58,669
kind of privacy enhancing technology if

1168
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:01,099
we were forced to endure the

1169
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:03,019
inconvenience of these difficult to use

1170
00:57:01,099 --> 00:57:05,869
tools we would be more strongly

1171
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:08,359
motivated to try to weave them into the

1172
00:57:05,869 --> 00:57:12,109
communication infrastructure in a way

1173
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:16,939
that some folks like us would find it

1174
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:19,509
painless and I'll say that you know the

1175
00:57:16,939 --> 00:57:22,098
first problem I described that server

1176
00:57:19,509 --> 00:57:25,189
mediated electronic mail problem I

1177
00:57:22,099 --> 00:57:28,969
thought about that problem within days

1178
00:57:25,189 --> 00:57:33,288
of starting to use a system called pond

1179
00:57:28,969 --> 00:57:36,019
that Adam Langley that Adam Langley

1180
00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:39,410
invented I think a lot of ideas will

1181
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:43,069
spring from simply becoming users of

1182
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:46,640
this technology one colleague told me

1183
00:57:43,069 --> 00:57:50,119
that cryptographer is failure to use

1184
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:52,368
privacy enhancing tools was to him like

1185
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:54,799
discovering your doctor smoked two packs

1186
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:57,259
of cigarettes a day and with an

1187
00:57:54,799 --> 00:58:01,959
intravenous drug user on top of that and

1188
00:57:57,259 --> 00:58:01,959
so on I think it's not a bad analogy a

1189
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:07,999
lot of us like to think of the Internet

1190
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:12,559
as some kind of wonderful cryptographic

1191
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:15,229
as some kind of wonderful commons it's

1192
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:17,150
not really a commons at OU there are

1193
00:58:15,229 --> 00:58:19,759
specific things on the internet like

1194
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:23,390
Wikipedia and Creative Commons and the

1195
00:58:19,759 --> 00:58:27,069
and the free software movement but most

1196
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:30,098
of us most of the time are using on the

1197
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:32,558
her net services provided by a very

1198
00:58:30,099 --> 00:58:35,680
small number of very powerful companies

1199
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:38,619
I think we should be doing our best to

1200
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,989
be replicating these services in a more

1201
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:43,209
secure way in a way that's out of reach

1202
00:58:40,989 --> 00:58:45,309
of power and there will be important

1203
00:58:43,209 --> 00:58:48,129
cryptographic problems in trying to

1204
00:58:45,309 --> 00:58:50,559
achieve this end emphasizing that

1205
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:53,709
prerequisite I think we should be trying

1206
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:59,349
to create amongst ourselves some kind of

1207
00:58:53,709 --> 00:59:01,569
of useful cryptographic Commons now the

1208
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:03,999
cypherpunks were already advocating this

1209
00:59:01,569 --> 00:59:06,670
decades ago in their creation of

1210
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:09,788
anonymous remailers for example that was

1211
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:11,829
very much their program I think we could

1212
00:59:09,789 --> 00:59:15,039
start small you know Wikipedia is a

1213
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:19,660
Commons that we all employ maybe it

1214
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:21,609
could become a routine part of IAC our

1215
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:23,440
conferences and workshops and doctrinal

1216
00:59:21,609 --> 00:59:26,098
meetings to spend an afternoon or an

1217
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:29,979
evening gathered around and hacking on

1218
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:33,819
Wikipedia pages so that cryptography as

1219
00:59:29,979 --> 00:59:35,499
as reflected in Wikipedia is really

1220
00:59:33,819 --> 00:59:39,339
state-of-the-art and beautifully

1221
00:59:35,499 --> 00:59:42,479
captured I have a bunch of conclusions

1222
00:59:39,339 --> 00:59:47,170
to give you hmm

1223
00:59:42,479 --> 00:59:52,718
and no time my have one minute which all

1224
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:55,809
over youth time is a flexible thing my

1225
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:57,999
view is that cryptographers are kind of

1226
00:59:55,809 --> 01:00:00,519
twice culpable for the surveillance

1227
00:59:57,999 --> 01:00:02,828
morass in which we find ourselves first

1228
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:05,859
it's computer scientists that really

1229
01:00:02,829 --> 01:00:08,289
created this enormous communications

1230
01:00:05,859 --> 01:00:13,719
infrastructure and then that turned it

1231
01:00:08,289 --> 01:00:17,739
into this amazing tool for for

1232
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:20,559
surveilling us all and on the other hand

1233
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:23,829
cryptography offers at least some set of

1234
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:25,150
tools and hope to turning around this

1235
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:28,569
tragic event

1236
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:31,359
I don't think I'm an alarmist with

1237
01:00:28,569 --> 01:00:34,000
respect to you know bizarre dystopias

1238
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:36,029
that filmmakers a novelists like to put

1239
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,900
forward I don't worry about

1240
01:00:36,029 --> 01:00:41,220
nanotechnology turning our biosphere

1241
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:44,230
into gray goo I never worry about

1242
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:52,169
sentient robots coming and deciding that

1243
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:52,170
man is a pet at best but I think here

1244
01:00:55,810 --> 01:01:01,600
this is a very realistic dystopia the

1245
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:03,430
kind of creeping surveillance that grows

1246
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,450
organically in the public and private

1247
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:09,279
sectors that becomes increasingly

1248
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:11,669
comprehensive and enjoyed and predictive

1249
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:14,350
that becomes an instrument for

1250
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:17,290
assassinations and political control and

1251
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:19,150
the maintenance of power this kind of

1252
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:20,830
vision doesn't just seem possible it

1253
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:23,650
seems to actually be happening before

1254
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:26,980
our eyes okay if it's not already here

1255
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:28,540
I'm not terribly optimistic you know I

1256
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:32,080
think there are tremendous forces

1257
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:34,870
aligned to make sure that we don't make

1258
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:37,390
much progress in in these directions and

1259
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:40,720
yet I think there are some some reasons

1260
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:42,759
for for hope you know cryptographic

1261
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,950
paper is inspired by the Snowden

1262
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:47,020
revelations we're starting to appear a

1263
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:48,669
pace there are several people in this

1264
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:51,070
room that have been going around giving

1265
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:54,310
talks about you know post Snowden

1266
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:57,490
cryptography and panel discussions on on

1267
01:01:54,310 --> 01:02:00,520
this matter and I think that we are

1268
01:01:57,490 --> 01:02:03,359
starting to feel connected to this

1269
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:06,640
problems in ways that we didn't prior to

1270
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:09,070
2013 and the cypherpunks are still very

1271
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:11,170
much on the stage and creating anti

1272
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:13,390
surveillance technologies you know

1273
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:17,080
whatsapp for example now has a billion

1274
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:19,990
users of it a lot of apparently good

1275
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:24,970
cryptography in in a lot of people's

1276
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:29,319
hands the cypherpunks

1277
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:32,379
are sometimes described as doing crypto

1278
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:34,240
with an attitude and I think that makes

1279
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:36,220
some of us uncomfortable because it

1280
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:39,549
might not quite be our day-to-day

1281
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:42,399
attitude but more than anything else

1282
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:45,670
what the cypherpunks have wanted is

1283
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:47,800
crypto with values and I think crypto

1284
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:51,460
with values is what we as the

1285
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:53,369
cryptographic community are most sorely

1286
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:56,140
in need of

1287
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:59,019
I'll finally end with this there's this

1288
01:02:56,140 --> 01:03:00,910
quote often misattributed to Pericles

1289
01:02:59,019 --> 01:03:03,249
that says that just because you don't

1290
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:04,689
take an interest in politics doesn't

1291
01:03:03,249 --> 01:03:07,448
mean that politics won't take an

1292
01:03:04,689 --> 01:03:10,058
interest in you and as a cryptographer

1293
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:12,579
you really can ignore the political and

1294
01:03:10,059 --> 01:03:14,769
moral dimensions of our field but it

1295
01:03:12,579 --> 01:03:17,319
won't make them go away all it'll

1296
01:03:14,769 --> 01:03:20,529
actually do is to make your own work

1297
01:03:17,319 --> 01:03:24,549
less relevant and less sociological II

1298
01:03:20,529 --> 01:03:27,519
connected my hope is that a bunch of you

1299
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:30,339
especially young people will recognize

1300
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:33,779
this as a starting point in your work

1301
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:36,249
and work to develop an ethically driven

1302
01:03:33,779 --> 01:03:40,079
vision of what you actually want to

1303
01:03:36,249 --> 01:03:40,078
accomplish with your cryptographic work

1304
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:46,509
like thank you so very much for that

1305
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:47,979
inspiring call to arms and I think

1306
01:03:46,509 --> 01:03:54,880
there'll be some questions or passed on

1307
01:03:47,979 --> 01:03:58,419
to Eddie you know Peter I disagree with

1308
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:03,429
much of what you're saying I'll take one

1309
01:03:58,419 --> 01:04:05,979
example only this is something that we

1310
01:04:03,429 --> 01:04:09,219
can predict what will happen to our new

1311
01:04:05,979 --> 01:04:11,979
invention in their future and I'll just

1312
01:04:09,219 --> 01:04:15,309
give you two examples you mentioned that

1313
01:04:11,979 --> 01:04:18,098
language in the mid-80s of identity

1314
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:19,509
basic cryptography had an element of key

1315
01:04:18,099 --> 01:04:21,849
ESCO which is bad

1316
01:04:19,509 --> 01:04:24,179
I absolutely agree that it has been

1317
01:04:21,849 --> 01:04:27,759
element of key s what the question is

1318
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:30,369
should refrain from publishing this idea

1319
01:04:27,759 --> 01:04:33,069
after it occurred to me and you have to

1320
01:04:30,369 --> 01:04:35,499
remember that in 2001 declared benign

1321
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:38,380
Franklin to invent pairing base

1322
01:04:35,499 --> 01:04:41,738
geography it's a solution to the problem

1323
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:44,669
and this was used later to do lots of

1324
01:04:41,739 --> 01:04:47,859
wonderful privacy enhancing stuff so

1325
01:04:44,669 --> 01:04:49,658
while you may criticize the original

1326
01:04:47,859 --> 01:04:52,119
idea it's not going in the political

1327
01:04:49,659 --> 01:04:53,799
direction you are interested it was

1328
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:55,569
totally impossible to predict what will

1329
01:04:53,799 --> 01:04:58,569
happen to it in the future so

1330
01:04:55,569 --> 01:05:00,999
self-censorship or your last suggestion

1331
01:04:58,569 --> 01:05:03,640
that every paper we are public should be

1332
01:05:00,999 --> 01:05:04,839
tagged initially upon invention is being

1333
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,640
good or bad in print

1334
01:05:04,839 --> 01:05:08,319
simple and the based on it you should

1335
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:10,569
publish or not publish it is very

1336
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:13,569
problematic my second example which goes

1337
01:05:10,569 --> 01:05:16,920
the other direction is Bitcoin bitcoin

1338
01:05:13,569 --> 01:05:19,900
was invented as a wonderful

1339
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:22,479
decentralized system going exactly the

1340
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:24,539
way you wanted on the other hand if you

1341
01:05:22,479 --> 01:05:27,910
look at how Bitcoin is practiced today

1342
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:31,229
it's totally centralized there is a tiny

1343
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:35,618
number of large consultive mining

1344
01:05:31,229 --> 01:05:38,259
bitcoins it's used to do all the ransom

1345
01:05:35,619 --> 01:05:39,579
well I could go on and on about all the

1346
01:05:38,259 --> 01:05:41,710
bad things that happened

1347
01:05:39,579 --> 01:05:43,150
I personally believe it's going to be

1348
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:46,960
totally wrong

1349
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:50,739
for each one of us to take his ideas

1350
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,900
research ideas as being born good or

1351
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:54,489
born bed and based on they decide

1352
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:58,509
whether to publish or not to publish it

1353
01:05:54,489 --> 01:06:00,219
so I appreciate that comment and that

1354
01:05:58,509 --> 01:06:02,859
concern I've certainly struggled with it

1355
01:06:00,219 --> 01:06:05,469
much myself it is very difficult to

1356
01:06:02,859 --> 01:06:09,098
ascertain the direction of the science

1357
01:06:05,469 --> 01:06:13,299
and technology and I think that many of

1358
01:06:09,099 --> 01:06:15,609
us use this as a reason to not pay close

1359
01:06:13,299 --> 01:06:19,450
attention to where we think things will

1360
01:06:15,609 --> 01:06:21,848
head and I am NOT suggesting that people

1361
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:25,419
self-censor their ideas because they

1362
01:06:21,849 --> 01:06:28,150
think that the political leanings are

1363
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:32,200
undesirable but I think the simple act

1364
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:35,200
of keeping strongly in mind where you

1365
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:37,660
want things to go will tend as a whole

1366
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,999
to move us in this direction not to each

1367
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:42,788
individual piece of work but somehow as

1368
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:45,009
a whole if our community cares about the

1369
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:48,309
social contribution of what we're doing

1370
01:06:45,009 --> 01:06:50,369
I think as a whole will move in that

1371
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:50,369
direction

1372
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:58,900
and that's the most I can say about it I

1373
01:06:54,430 --> 01:07:03,060
would not minimize the difficulty in

1374
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:07,450
trying to be predictive about where are

1375
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:12,009
our most well-meaning ideas might end up

1376
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:18,069
or where our most concerning ideas might

1377
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:20,290
might evolve thanks Phil for a very

1378
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:22,120
thought-provoking talk I enjoyed it very

1379
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:25,990
much and I think a lot of us here did

1380
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:28,240
could I ask you your opinion of the

1381
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:32,169
Internet of Things and the opportunities

1382
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:34,359
for personal privacy in terms of the

1383
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:39,460
future of the Internet of Things and 20

1384
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:40,990
years time for instance certainly you

1385
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:48,250
know I like this phrase the Internet of

1386
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:51,970
creepy things I think we're continually

1387
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:54,610
promised technological advances which

1388
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:57,609
are supposed to make life better and the

1389
01:07:54,610 --> 01:08:00,040
Internet of Things is among them what a

1390
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:03,880
wonderful world we will live in when our

1391
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:07,210
toaster knows us and our refrigerator

1392
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:10,570
can make informed decisions about about

1393
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:14,050
our eating habits and so on I myself

1394
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:16,960
have never understood how this vision of

1395
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:20,680
a technological future improves man's

1396
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:24,189
laught and yet we seem to head in this

1397
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:26,730
kind of direction anyway I would like to

1398
01:08:24,189 --> 01:08:29,019
see people be quite skeptical about

1399
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:30,969
advances not only in the direction of

1400
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:36,549
you know Internet of Things but data

1401
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:39,580
mining and a host of of technologies

1402
01:08:36,549 --> 01:08:42,760
that we are closely connected to as

1403
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:46,210
computer scientists that I don't really

1404
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:50,020
believe are likely to contribute to a

1405
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:52,450
more positive future for mankind so the

1406
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:55,420
Internet of Things certainly has with it

1407
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:58,510
many kind of security concerns but it

1408
01:08:55,420 --> 01:09:00,670
also carries with it the potential of

1409
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:02,350
just making life

1410
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:08,230
an unpleasant space in which to be

1411
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:11,529
living okay so I think sometimes we do

1412
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:13,778
work on stuff that the NSA I'm not

1413
01:09:11,529 --> 01:09:15,910
interested in but there are no interest

1414
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:19,480
in it because it's not in their mission

1415
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:21,849
so if I go back to the 92 crypto log it

1416
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:23,948
says that he took on some reading

1417
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:25,660
material to avoid listening to some

1418
01:09:23,948 --> 01:09:29,410
talks and this was very good because

1419
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:31,750
there was a three talks which were three

1420
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:33,818
more snoozers he talks about and the

1421
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:36,310
3-mile snoozers or is in a session on

1422
01:09:33,819 --> 01:09:38,259
digital signatures and electronics cache

1423
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:39,790
so I think the point is is that they

1424
01:09:38,259 --> 01:09:41,830
didn't actually realize that these have

1425
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:43,778
been that they were ignoring the talks

1426
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:45,939
that were actually nothing to do with

1427
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:48,790
encryption which is more to do with the

1428
01:09:45,939 --> 01:09:51,488
kind of things that you want that so I

1429
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:55,540
think we do work in the areas that the

1430
01:09:51,488 --> 01:09:57,519
only thing that one and they ignore us I

1431
01:09:55,540 --> 01:10:00,460
mean so high told me yesterday that he

1432
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:04,210
thought the crypto log article evidenced

1433
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:08,230
large blind spots that the NSA

1434
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:11,910
effectively missed I don't know you know

1435
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:15,879
at some level I thought that that that

1436
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:17,830
crypto log article pegged our community

1437
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:21,489
to a tee and that that's what really

1438
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:25,929
made us uncomfortable and yet I think it

1439
01:10:21,489 --> 01:10:28,209
is also the case that intelligence

1440
01:10:25,929 --> 01:10:29,949
agencies to have their own very

1441
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:31,840
particular way of looking at the

1442
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:36,549
universe that does no doubt give them

1443
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:38,770
substantial blind spots my suspicion for

1444
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:41,949
example is that they really understand

1445
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:45,250
nothing of provable security and that

1446
01:10:41,949 --> 01:10:47,650
that does cause them to make errors that

1447
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:53,500
they wouldn't otherwise make I remember

1448
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:55,989
following the appearance of of GCM and

1449
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:58,660
oh they see OCB and IEM all of these

1450
01:10:55,989 --> 01:11:01,509
methods for authenticated encryption the

1451
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:03,750
NSA threw in their own contribution for

1452
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:07,810
an integrated authenticated encryption

1453
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:10,510
dual something mode I forget it took me

1454
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:12,430
about an hour I think to break it and

1455
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:16,330
I'm a lousy Crypt analyst

1456
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:18,640
okay why would NSA representatives

1457
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:20,140
produce this proposal which they proudly

1458
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,730
said they had been working on for a

1459
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:24,640
couple of years to show that they

1460
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:27,190
haven't really been undercut by us at

1461
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,770
academics that was so flagrantly wrong

1462
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:32,259
well it was only flagrantly wrong if you

1463
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:34,330
had internalized a definition of what

1464
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:37,390
authenticated encryption was supposed to

1465
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:40,720
do and I think the contribution

1466
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:42,370
evidenced the these authors maybe the

1467
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:45,610
NSA were but at least these authors

1468
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:47,530
really had no definitional understanding

1469
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:50,200
of the problem they were attempting to

1470
01:11:47,530 --> 01:12:00,429
solve and that they probably pay a price

1471
01:11:50,200 --> 01:12:01,630
for that so we're way over time for a

1472
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:05,370
coffee so I think we'll have one more

1473
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:05,370
quick question and a quick answer please

1474
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:16,240
today is a very large part of it

1475
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:19,269
funded by the government maybe not

1476
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:21,580
military but even the university funding

1477
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:24,160
person comes from the government and all

1478
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:26,140
it's funded by large companies so do you

1479
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:28,150
think if the research moves in the right

1480
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:32,320
direction you talk about this funding

1481
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:35,080
maitreya it has been a problem across

1482
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:37,000
academia that we have relied more and

1483
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:39,750
more on government funding and in the

1484
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:43,300
United States Dwight Eisenhower famously

1485
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:48,970
warned that as academic institutions

1486
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:52,080
become more and more drinking eating

1487
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:54,160
from this truth of academic of

1488
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:57,540
government funding that they would be

1489
01:12:54,160 --> 01:13:01,420
corrupted and you can say the same of

1490
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:05,820
corporate funding I think in the ideal

1491
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:11,220
world academic institutions would have

1492
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:13,530
ample money that was really quite

1493
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:15,449
unencumbered

1494
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:17,909
in the real world we live in this

1495
01:13:15,449 --> 01:13:21,089
doesn't seem to be the model at all and

1496
01:13:17,909 --> 01:13:23,789
even less and less so as time goes on

1497
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:26,210
and I think it's a big concern that all

1498
01:13:23,789 --> 01:13:29,159
of us academics should be unhappy about

1499
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:30,539
okay so I think we think well I'm gonna

1500
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:33,750
go for 20-minute coffee break so we'll

1501
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:37,340
come back here at 5:35 but I'd like to

1502
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:37,340
thank Phil for his inspiring talk
