1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
so the ice ABC News lecture of this year

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,490
is ron rivest and i can start with a

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,470
cliched out of course rom doesn't need

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,420
introduction in this community we all

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,509
know his work on our essay on digital

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,210
signatures is very creative work on

7
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,900
cypress and hash functions the rcx

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,160
family the mdx family which actually

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,590
help cryptography switch from hardware

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,189
to software the ground also has worked

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,800
in many other topics of crypto IDs which

12
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,300
he put forward like to call encryption

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,260
certificate management and schotzie

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,570
voted off ID tags micro payments folding

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,699
and outside crypto also on computer

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,190
algorithms and machine learning if I

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,870
would start enumerate all the honors one

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,930
we see if we take most of his talk so i

19
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,190
will not do that i just want to mention

20
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,260
that he's a member of the National

21
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,820
Academy of Engineering and of science a

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,410
fellow of the ACM I see are an american

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,850
academy of arts and sciences and

24
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,800
interests and two together with adi

25
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,260
shamir and when Adelman he won the

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,328
curing of work in addition to his

27
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,309
academic work of course wrong is also

28
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,990
known as the founder of our state of

29
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,869
security and he has also been very

30
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,330
active in the voting community not only

31
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,939
technical side but also helping to make

32
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,590
voting systems work so please join me in

33
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,589
welcoming around best

34
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,740
Thank You Bart it's a pleasure to be

35
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,960
here it's been 30 years since the first

36
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,070
one of these summits it's an honor and I

37
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,190
want to thank the organizing committee

38
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:39,639
for inviting me to come talk so the talk

39
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:42,130
will not be in Latin in fact that's not

40
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,990
even Latin that's that's mock Latin the

41
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:47,110
translation of this is don't let the

42
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:50,640
bastards grind you down it's a phrase

43
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,869
that originated in World War two and

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,610
carborundum didn't exist of course at

45
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:57,039
the time of the Romans so it's an

46
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,479
abrasive right so it was mocked it has

47
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,509
its own Wikipedia page if you want to

48
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:05,080
hear more about bhavan so this talk will

49
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:07,200
take us a actually a keynote talk is an

50
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,489
opportunity to stretch a bit so this is

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,869
sort of marginally cryptography it's

52
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:13,239
related to cryptography as you'll see

53
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:14,920
but it's not your sort of usual crypto

54
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,350
thing i'm going to do some new models

55
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,640
and some new questions but what are you

56
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,400
talking about games they sort of go back

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,589
and forth back and forth continually in

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,430
a simple model that reflects that and

59
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:29,890
some results on that so will be some

60
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,100
overview context and then this

61
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:36,160
particular game that's a model for the

62
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,260
situation I'll call it flip it and then

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,290
some discussion of results within that

64
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,690
framework non-adaptive play first and

65
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,970
then adaptive play and some lessons and

66
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,859
some open questions but the high-level

67
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,350
goal is to capture some aspects of the

68
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:51,880
field of security that maybe we're not

69
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,040
capturing well yet and trying to

70
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,900
encourage you to focus more on these

71
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,980
other kinds of issues it's not something

72
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,989
that's been ignored but I think it needs

73
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:03,548
more emphasis and maybe some new models

74
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:06,640
will help so a cryptography is mostly

75
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:08,260
about using mathematics and secrets to

76
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:14,220
achieve some goals confidentiality

77
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:16,470
integrity and so on so the mathematics

78
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,000
we're starting to understand pretty well

79
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,709
but it's the managing of secrets at this

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,549
talk will focus more on or emphasize

81
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:26,470
more so we're making we make assumptions

82
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:27,970
we make assumptions that parties can

83
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,190
generate good secrets and we've seen

84
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:34,570
some discussion of that today with with

85
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:36,549
the extractors and so on for generating

86
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,000
secrets and and keeping them secret

87
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:41,240
that's the point I want to focus on

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,710
today is keeping secrets we also assume

89
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,290
that the adversary can't do certain

90
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:49,130
computations etc so these are normal

91
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:51,410
assumptions that we make but things go

92
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:56,120
wrong right murphy's law says if

93
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:57,799
anything can go wrong it will says no

94
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:03,160
connection with the fact that the beaver

95
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:06,700
is the MIT mascot but I needed whatever

96
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,890
and things could go wrong badly the

97
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,790
Maginot Line in world war two was built

98
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:15,290
around an assumption by the French that

99
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,180
the Germans would not try to attack

100
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,010
there and if they did go around try to

101
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,130
go around it it would take them too long

102
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:24,590
and it did feel badly the Germans

103
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,600
skirted the defenses quickly the

104
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,419
assumption failed very badly and now the

105
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,730
Maginot Line is a metaphor for building

106
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:33,620
static defenses and relying too much on

107
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,700
your assumption that they will hold or

108
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,140
cause they have a theory to take too

109
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,570
much trouble to go around them in an

110
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:45,050
adversarial situation of course

111
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,520
assumptions may fail repeatedly idea

112
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,110
that somebody could fly a plane into a

113
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,570
building as part of a hijacking someone

114
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,960
do that more than once showed the

115
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,099
weakness of our assumptions and apts are

116
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,710
sort of like that advanced persistent

117
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,510
threats where I Viserys continually push

118
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,039
against your defenses and try to get

119
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,960
around them in various ways and may

120
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,729
succeed often I mean even now the NSA

121
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,229
says you know they assume that a certain

122
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:11,419
fraction of their networks are

123
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:13,219
compromised so most of most of the

124
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,080
crypto that we have today is is sort of

125
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,010
like the Maginot Line and it's style

126
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,419
right and we design these schemes we

127
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:23,930
assume that setup has been done properly

128
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:25,159
that the keys are well well generated

129
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,080
and that they're distributed properly

130
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,470
and then we're ready to play the game

131
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:34,340
right then we assume that the adversary

132
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,780
is not going to steal the keys we got

133
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,369
our measure no line set the

134
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,659
cryptographic assumptions and the

135
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,610
assumption that the keys will be kept

136
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,830
secret is there that's our national line

137
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,919
so we've made our assumptions we live

138
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,198
behind those lines

139
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:50,630
but the theft that the assumption that

140
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,190
the adversary won't steal keys is

141
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,250
qualitatively a bit different I think

142
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,229
than the assumption that computations

143
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,699
are hard because that's a problem that

144
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:01,430
in the real world that somebody has to

145
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:03,410
solve using tools and techniques that

146
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,520
are that are qualitatively I would argue

147
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,320
much weaker than some of the

148
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,109
mathematical complexity of the

149
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,300
assumptions that we have it's not a

150
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,449
strong assumption as we've seen over and

151
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,580
over again especially recently so we

152
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:18,800
have some research in the field that

153
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,380
allows us to assume that the adversary

154
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,100
can steal keys or at least portions of

155
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:28,729
them going back to secret sharing adi

156
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,770
shamir and 79 Proactive cryptography i'm

157
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:32,539
just giving us mattering of citation to

158
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,359
this excuse me if I haven't listed your

159
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:38,120
favorite paper Proactive cryptography

160
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,490

leakage riesling crypto McCauley and

164
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,060
raising before for example some of these

165
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,120
these these assume that the adversary

166
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,770
can sort of it get at some of your key

167
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,630
but not very much of it or not all of it

168
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,120
anyway and you can manage so we show

169
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,530
that if some amount of leakage is some

170
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,949
amount of theft is is what we can

171
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,388
tolerate but the adversary typically

172
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:08,349
isn't allowed to steal everything and

173
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:11,389
there are some papers that do allow that

174
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:14,570
resilience secure channels by it gets

175
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:17,479
mcnerney and Russell is a nice example

176
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,919
of assuming that they have us or you can

177
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,469
actually steal everything but we have

178
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:24,830
very little research on what how to

179
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:28,280
think about keys being stolen entirely

180
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,719
so assuming that the adversary can get

181
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,250
some leakage or still some of the key

182
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,870
that's sort of moving your measure no

183
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,520
line your digital you're lying in the

184
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,750
sand a little bit I assume he ever sir

185
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,520
he's not going to cross that line or

186
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,080
maybe not even that line but that's as

187
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,698
far as he can go you know he's just

188
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:45,109
going to walk all over you so to be a

189
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:46,340
security professional you there

190
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,930
shouldn't be limits on your paranoia

191
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,070
right the adversary is not going to pay

192
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,979
attention to your assumptions he's going

193
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,870
to do what he what do you can so are we

194
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:57,080
being sufficiently paranoid so I would

195
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:59,670
argue that maybe you were not that we're

196
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,950
making up problems for other people to

197
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,990
solve that we haven't solved versus how

198
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:07,440
to keep secrets and we're assuming that

199
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:12,480
can be kept solved well and that may be

200
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:16,680
false there's a famous riddle due to our

201
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,840
16th president abraham lincoln if i call

202
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:23,370
the dog's tail a leg how many legs does

203
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:25,200
it have the answer of course is for it

204
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:29,430
doesn't matter what you call call a tail

205
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:32,069
it's still tail right that was one of

206
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,979
his favorite we have something similar

207
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,120
here right now calling a bit string a

208
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,790
secret key doesn't actually make it

209
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,990
secret doesn't do anything towards

210
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,250
making a scene that just points out is

211
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,479
that should somebody's got to keep that

212
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,630
thing not my job but you know somebody

213
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,340
should keep that thing secret it just

214
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:50,760
identifies it's an interesting target

215
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:53,330
for the adversary really so labeling it

216
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,530
is not the same thing as protecting it

217
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,000
we do a lot of labeling that should be

218
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,589
secret that should be secret that should

219
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,510
be secret we're making a problems for

220
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,530
other people to solve but you know

221
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,270
they've got to be solved they got to be

222
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,459
solved well or we've got to figure out

223
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,810
how to deal with a situation when

224
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:11,070
they're not solved well maybe that's

225
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:13,979
more the point of this time so our goal

226
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,930
here is to develop a new model new

227
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,070
models for scenarios involving total key

228
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:21,420
loss and related scenarios especially

229
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,090
and this is the new point where the

230
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,500
where the theft is covert right so

231
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,210
sometimes happen your password gets

232
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,450
stolen or your your secret key gets old

233
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,100
and you don't know it right that's an

234
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,870
interesting scenario that's one that we

235
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,520
should be caring about as security

236
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,990
professionals what do you do how do you

237
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,910
think about those situations how do you

238
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:42,060
how do you model them but what can you

239
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,560
do so I'm going to be introducing a

240
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,510
model it tries to capture at least some

241
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,579
aspects of those situations for the

242
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:50,600
theft is stealthy or the theft is covert

243
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:56,070
you don't know that you've been hacked

244
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:57,810
maybe until later alright so I'm going

245
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:01,860
to do this in the framework of a game so

246
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:05,010
that was all motivation and so I'm going

247
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,420
to present a game here is very simple to

248
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,950
persuade that you'll enjoy it very

249
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,649
simple two-person game that tries to

250
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,720
capture

251
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,240
capture this and give some some initial

252
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,920
results this is very much sort of work

253
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,569
in progress or preliminary but I

254
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,459
encourage you to think about these kinds

255
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:19,868
of models and what we can do or how to

256
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:22,268
model these kinds of situations better

257
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:25,240
too so this is joint work with folks at

258
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:30,579
RSA labs re jewels alina apres Martin

259
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,420
Van Dyke and so we'll talk about the

260
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:33,699
game of flip it and they've been

261
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,079
thinking about some of the results now

262
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,490
see there's the some work that may be

263
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:37,839
available on the web soon where you can

264
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:41,769
actually play this game online if you

265
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:45,509
like so as I said it's very simple game

266
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:49,689
it's a two-player game there's a

267
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:51,939
defender who's player zero and a

268
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:53,410
attacker who's player one and this is

269
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:54,459
supposed to be blue and red he tell the

270
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:58,899
difference in the colors I think that's

271
00:10:54,459 --> 00:11:00,550
ok so blue and red so these are the

272
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:03,790
placements of her pretty very much a

273
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,529
symmetric game aside from the move cause

274
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,219
so the players will have a different

275
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:10,779
cost of moving and you'll see how this

276
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,389
works in just a second so there's some

277
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:16,089
contested resource or critical resource

278
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:18,670
and it could be a password or a secret

279
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:21,370
or something like this that the game is

280
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,139
about and so this is just abstract in

281
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,749
this situation it's they the thing

282
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:29,949
that's being fought over by these two

283
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:32,439
players the security of the password the

284
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:35,439
security of the digital key but this

285
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:36,910
model also applies equally well to other

286
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:38,649
things like computer systems where the

287
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,980
computer system can either be hacked or

288
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:44,230
not or maybe a mountain pass if you want

289
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,819
a military situation right so mountain

290
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,370
pass could be secured by one side of the

291
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:50,920
other so we've got some contested

292
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,749
resource and the state of that resource

293
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,389
is binary either be a good state or bad

294
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:58,480
state so in the case of a password it

295
00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:02,110
might be secure secret or it might be

296
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,470
guest or stolen so it compromised clean

297
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,790
are compromised for your key controlled

298
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,639
by the defender controlled by the tech

299
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:16,430
so it's a binary so not that's it's a

300
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:18,890
very simple blue or red so two players

301
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:22,760
each player has a corresponding favorite

302
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:26,449
state and a player can move to put the

303
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:29,240
game into his state at any time so the

304
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:31,130
defender can move and put the game into

305
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,240
the state resource into his state so in

306
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,890
the case of a password you might

307
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,410
initialize the password or change his

308
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,029
password reset the password you might

309
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,520
recover the computer system put it back

310
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:41,930
into a clean State my disinfect get rid

311
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,819
of the virus of the malware or whatever

312
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,800
so so the some move I'm just calling it

313
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:49,220
abstractly of move that the good guy can

314
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,859
take that puts it into a good state and

315
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,810
correspondingly there's some move but

316
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,270
the bad guy can do it puts it into the

317
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,939
bad state it's compromised it's correct

318
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,860
rob somebody he installs malware he

319
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,089
steals at he steals the password he

320
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,760
injects it right so that's all there's

321
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:06,529
was those two kinds of moves one move

322
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,020
for the good guy one move for the bad

323
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:10,459
guy and then they can move at any time

324
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,899
and time is continuous here it's

325
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:14,630
convenient to have continuous time

326
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:16,670
rather than discrete time unlike most

327
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,830
games is this is not staged during like

328
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,810
this so somebody can steal your password

329
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:25,370
anytime whatsoever so time is

330
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:27,020
continuously not discreet and so players

331
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,390
move at the same time with probability

332
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,470
zero we assume that so that we don't

333
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,730
have to worry about what happens that

334
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:37,730
they both try to move at the same time

335
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:39,730
so the password case creating a new

336
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,690
password of signing key stealing it

337
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,430
reading I think I said these before

338
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,700
reinstalling a system software using a

339
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:49,040
zero-day attack to install a rootkit

340
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,270
would be moved by the attacker sending

341
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,660
soldiers to the mountain pass by either

342
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:56,180
side would represent a move for the

343
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:59,089
mountain pass key so there's very simple

344
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,589
game so it's continual back and forth

345
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:03,200
worth there you can take over they can

346
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,910
take over you can take over again they

347
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,400
can take over at some point so the

348
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,270
attacker can take over at any time

349
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,310
there's no such thing as a perfect

350
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,630
defense here unlike most crypto where we

351
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,609
talk about building our defenses and

352
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,140
living behind them this is a situation

353
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:19,490
where the attacker can take control

354
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:23,110
whenever he wants to and the only option

355
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,110
for the defender is to retake it later

356
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:30,329
so it goes on forever perhaps so moves

357
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,880
can be stealthy this is the unique

358
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:36,930
aspect of this game in practice

359
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,370
compromises often undetected here we

360
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:42,089
assume that players don't know when the

361
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:44,730
other player moves all right so this is

362
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:47,070
unusual I've been trying to find things

363
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,149
in the game literature where game theory

364
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,040
literature where you don't know when the

365
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:51,389
other player moves there's a little bit

366
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,709
of it but very little and there's some

367
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:54,860
imperfect monitoring is the buzzword

368
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:59,579
you'll find it under but it's a I

369
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:02,190
haven't seen this game studied at all so

370
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:03,569
the players don't know when movie if

371
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,209
your machine is infected with malware

372
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,529
you don't know that it happens and if

373
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,880
you change your password the episode you

374
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:13,050
may not know that you've changed your

375
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,050
password until later so your uncertainty

376
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,790
about the state of the system increases

377
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:21,750
over time right so you move and you've

378
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,889
taken control but then as time evolves

379
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:28,589
you don't know whether you've retained

380
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:30,540
control or not so your move when you

381
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:32,069
move might be a flip where you've taken

382
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,439
control or might be what we call a flop

383
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:36,449
where it has no effect is useless you

384
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:41,010
change your password unnecessarily would

385
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:44,370
be a flop so if flops are sort of

386
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:45,420
unavoidable so what do you know about

387
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:49,500
the state of this is what's your

388
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:52,439
feedback so you only learn about the

389
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,819
state of the system when you move so in

390
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,740
general if you're not moving here you're

391
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:57,689
not seeing anything new about the system

392
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,760
when you move you can find out you have

393
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,110
different models for different aspects

394
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,459
so like when you change your password

395
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,589
you know whether your password was

396
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:06,719
compromised or not so in the basic

397
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,339
flippity game we assume that when you

398
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,339
move you find out the complete history

399
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:13,139
of moves by both players so you find out

400
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,730
not only was your password compromise

401
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,889
but you find out if it was compromised

402
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,290
when it was compromised and maybe other

403
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:20,519
moves that the player made so that sort

404
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,709
of the maximum about you could hope to

405
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,990
get you could certainly study variants

406
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:26,040
of the game where you learn less like

407
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,269
you'll just learn whether it have been

408
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,399
compromised or not or maybe you don't

409
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:32,930
even learn much of anything will study

410
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,930
some of those two

411
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:41,730
so you might find the times the player

412
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:44,640
last moved or whatever so in real life

413
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,750
moving in these examples moving costs

414
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,000
something right changing your password

415
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,860
takes effort you've got to write it down

416
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,090
on those sheet of paper you attached to

417
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,030
your computer or whatever put in your

418
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,470
wallet or whatever you do you know

419
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,030
you've got some cost of something

420
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,160
reinstalling the system software costs

421
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,540
something attacking cousin if you're the

422
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,959
attacker attacking cost something so

423
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:06,149
moves aren't for free so we assume just

424
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,329
some abstract model that says player I

425
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:14,370
when he moves it custom case of I points

426
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:15,869
and so the defender plays case of 0 to

427
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,979
move and the attacker pays case of one

428
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,329
we don't make them the same necessarily

429
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,400
I think it's important that they could

430
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,629
be different in fact the difference

431
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,820
between these two is I think an

432
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:31,740
important part of them the modeling here

433
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:33,300
so there's a move cost and the point of

434
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,750
the game is to be in control right you

435
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,950
want to have a system that's secure from

436
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:41,550
abuse by the adversary or you want your

437
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:43,440
password to be clean uncompromised so

438
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:45,389
we'll assume that the player earns one

439
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,600
point for every second that he's in

440
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,950
control okay so now we've got the basic

441
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,530
framework here we got moves we've got

442
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,570
the state state of the system now we've

443
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,430
got a scoring function so that we can

444
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,960
you pay to move and when you take move

445
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,580
you take control and you gained at once

446
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,740
point two per second of being in control

447
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,439
if you're the defender and it costs you

448
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,790
k sub zero to move then you hope that

449
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,500
you're going to get at least K sub 0

450
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,020
seconds of benefit because that you need

451
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,340
that to pay pay back the benefit

452
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,030
otherwise you're getting- benefit and

453
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,800
you might as well not play and somebody

454
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,960
the attacker wants to be in control for

455
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,620
at least K 1 seconds on the average to

456
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,620
pay for his move

457
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:28,320
so how well are you playing if you have

458
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:30,539
a two players playing over time you can

459
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,789
count how many moves you made right so

460
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:35,519
the number of moves made by player I and

461
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:37,200
sub I of T is the number of moves he

462
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,749
makes up the time T and his rate of play

463
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,359
then as alpha sub I of T just n sub I of

464
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:45,389
T divided by T so you can have some rate

465
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,830
of play and that corresponds to your

466
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:49,379
rate of expenditure for the moves of

467
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,570
course too and you have some rate of

468
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:53,189
being in control right that at each time

469
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,349
either one player the others and control

470
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,609
so ji-sub I of T can be the number of

471
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:59,639
seconds here and control up to time T

472
00:18:56,609 --> 00:19:01,559
gana sabha is the rate at which you're

473
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:04,830
gaining benefit from being in control

474
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:06,299
and then your score your benefit is just

475
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,449
the difference between the amount of

476
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:10,859
time you're in control and kaisa by your

477
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,139
move cost times the number of moves you

478
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:15,649
made up to a given time and your rate of

479
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:18,718
benefit and it's just that divided by T

480
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:22,439
so gamma sub i's your rate of gain minus

481
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:24,269
K sub I times your rate of moving so the

482
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,249
players want to maximize the limit

483
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:28,679
limiting rate of benefit so it's not a

484
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:30,119
zero-sum game right the players can can

485
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,889
move at different rates and they can

486
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,109
both move very fast and pay a lot and

487
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:35,639
get not much benefit out of it or they

488
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:38,039
could both play slowly and maybe they do

489
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:39,029
better so there's not a zero-sum game

490
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,279
here we're sort of assuming that each

491
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:43,499
player is playing to maximize his own

492
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:46,559
benefit as a typical two-person

493
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:47,729
nonzero-sum games alright so these but

494
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,690
each player will have his own benefit

495
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:54,929
rate that he wishes to maximize so

496
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:57,389
here's a made a little movie so you know

497
00:19:54,929 --> 00:20:00,570
it's just sort of obvious what's going

498
00:19:57,389 --> 00:20:02,668
on here so the red circles represent

499
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,259
attack attacking moves by the adversary

500
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:10,409
the blue circles are attacking moves by

501
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:11,759
the defender and you play along and the

502
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,839
defenders in the choice starts off the

503
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,149
game playing and then all of a sudden

504
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,320
he's hacked but he doesn't know this

505
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:19,939
right so now the attackers in control

506
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:22,710
the defender doesn't know the defender

507
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,919
plays he may find out at that time that

508
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,820
he was hacked they may be sits around

509
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,030
maybe plays again he doesn't know

510
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:34,610
alrighty what's going on he plays again

511
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:36,410
and his costs at any time right at this

512
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,240
point we can see we played a bit of the

513
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,520
game the attackers been in control five

514
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,890
and a half seconds two moves it cost

515
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,510
three each or giving a score he's got

516
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,910
negative score at this point the

517
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,710
defenders played three times been to

518
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:56,030
control for 15 seconds and has a cost of

519
00:20:48,710 --> 00:21:01,940
12 right very simple games very very

520
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:05,120
simple game now from the defenders point

521
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:08,960
of view right just to emphasize right

522
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,760
you'd only get feedback when you move so

523
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,710
here the defenders moved once but he

524
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,250
doesn't know now who whether he's in

525
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:19,490
control or not he's actually been hacked

526
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:21,950
when he moves he finds out oh my god

527
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,940
I've been hacked right now he still

528
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,710
doesn't know if he's in control anymore

529
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,970
as the episode going to play again he

530
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,110
tries again he's got a flop and maybe he

531
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,820
just waits it out in this case it's

532
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,550
early you only get information when you

533
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:39,980
move that just just emphasize that point

534
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:44,330
alright so the question how do you play

535
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:46,010
this game well so this is a model of a

536
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,990
situation where you can be hacked and

537
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,580
then you can undo the hack and you can

538
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:53,450
be hacked again and you don't know

539
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,800
anything until you've moved yourself how

540
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,210
can you have a scoring system you want

541
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,080
to be in control minus the cost you

542
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:04,160
moves how do you how do you play this

543
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:06,649
game well so not adaptive play let's

544
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,740
start with that all right so when you

545
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:12,560
move you you get information about the

546
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,270
other players history moves and you

547
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,940
could pay it try to figure out what he's

548
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:18,560
doing and and do that but I'll start

549
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,870
with a simple case and look at

550
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,840
non-adaptive flight where in fact your

551
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:27,830
moves are pre-programmed they don't

552
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:30,439
depend on what the other party does so a

553
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:32,480
non adaptive strategy plays on blindly

554
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,370
without attention to the other players

555
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,900
moves right that's one class of

556
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:40,040
strategies you could have just

557
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:45,770
make up your list it moves ahead of time

558
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:46,970
if you will write an infinite list so

559
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:50,000
there's some interesting non adaptive

560
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:53,210
strategies for example periodic play you

561
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,650
can just move every so often you change

562
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:59,780
your password very 90 days that's

563
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:04,070
periodic play you reboot your system

564
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:05,510
every morning or whatever that's

565
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:10,970
periodically you could have exponential

566
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:12,860
play you could have play where the and

567
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,270
give an instant of time your probability

568
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:18,169
is the same a plane it's a Poisson

569
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:20,150
process an exponential point we could

570
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:22,250
have a renewal strategy where the tight

571
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:24,020
time between moves is determined by some

572
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,030
probability distribution that you pick I

573
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:29,330
sort of generalization of those do

574
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:32,480
there's three classes of interesting not

575
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,909
adaptive strategies so let's look at

576
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,840
periodic play it turns out to be quite

577
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:41,690
interesting so a player may play

578
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,699
periodically with some rate alpha sub I

579
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:48,440
and period one over health and sub I of

580
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:49,670
course so for alpha f of 0 equals

581
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:54,860
one-third the defender might just play

582
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:57,410
every third step I want to assume here

583
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,929
that there's a little bit of jitter or

584
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:03,980
drift in the moves otherwise an adaptive

585
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:05,060
player will easily or two to set the

586
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,220
adapter fire can anyway play well but

587
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,060
then not adapt player even can sync up

588
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,950
so I don't want these strategies

589
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,419
periodic play versus periodically to

590
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,800
sync up at all so we're going to assume

591
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,470
there's a little periodic doesn't mean

592
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,820
exactly periodic very prion aquino you

593
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,470
if you're playing the period three

594
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,179
you're moving three plus or minus a

595
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:23,540
little bit of jitter and that will tend

596
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:25,460
to drift so that's convenient for the

597
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,840
analysis and the assumptions to work out

598
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,580
them you could talk about precisely

599
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,899
periodic aid case then you've got a

600
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:35,360
bunch of degenerate cases to worry about

601
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:36,620
too so if you even if you've got a

602
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,120
little bit of jitter though an adaptive

603
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,439
player can easily learn what you're

604
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,929
doing right so if your pleasure the

605
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,360
defender and you're changing your

606
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:45,830
rebooting your system every morning you

607
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,570
know the attacker can once once he

608
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,830
learns that because every time he moves

609
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,100
he learns over the history you can learn

610
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,770
your period your phase

611
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,500
he can just take over the system if you

612
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:57,750
reboot your system at 9am it can be take

613
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:02,640
over at nine oh five a.m. and you've had

614
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:04,140
it so periodic play doesn't work very

615
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,250
well against an adaptive attacker unless

616
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,750
you're playing very fast if you're

617
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:11,160
playing so fast that the attacker

618
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:15,270
doesn't have time to get his benefit

619
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:18,419
before before the you play again then

620
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,710
he's not the not going to play so

621
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,090
essentially is making his regular rounds

622
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,230
that's the classic movie situation where

623
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,939
you see the guy go around the castle

624
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,070
every 10 minutes and you watch them go

625
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:33,590
ahead sneaking right afterwards or your

626
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:37,230
90-day password so with the periodic

627
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,399
attacker against a periodic defender

628
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:42,120
let's look at that case it's actually

629
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,909
quite interesting so suppose the

630
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:50,668
attackers moving periodically some rate

631
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:51,929
alpha 1 and you're the defender you know

632
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:54,000
that you're going to play a periodic

633
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:56,370
strategy which what's your optimal

634
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,690
defender strategy in the case that

635
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:02,668
you're being attacked by a periodic

636
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:04,710
attacker so if you have the attackers

637
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:06,750
playing quickly you shouldn't play at

638
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,610
all these you'll have negative benefit

639
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:11,610
right so if the attacker is playing with

640
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:13,590
period I sorry with rate bigger than 1

641
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:17,100
over 2 K 0 then his intervals are

642
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:19,350
smaller than 2k 0 and you as a defender

643
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,918
need a k0 interval in order to get your

644
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:24,030
benefit and to pay for your move so on

645
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,240
the average you're going to get half of

646
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:28,620
the interval of the adversary so 2k0 is

647
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,659
sort of the limiting point and if it's

648
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,739
intervals are shorter than that the

649
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,890
attackers intervals are shorter than

650
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:36,390
that you shouldn't be playing at all if

651
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:41,070
the attacker is leaving you intervals of

652
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:42,510
exactly 2 K 0 then you should you can

653
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,639
play I mean it doesn't matter much you

654
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:46,049
can play not at all we can play up to a

655
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,190
certain rate but you're not going to get

656
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:48,629
any benefit at all you're going to get

657
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,830
on the average half of the attackers

658
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,480
intervals you're going to get just

659
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,000
enough to pay for your moves and that's

660
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,919
it no more and therefore you can play

661
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,340
that but you get no benefit on the other

662
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,960
hand at the adversaries more leisurely

663
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:05,678
you can play for positive benefit so

664
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:08,200
have you can play periodically at some

665
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,149
rate alpha 0 and if you do a little bit

666
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,590
of the calculus and optimize it turns

667
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:13,600
out you want to play faster than the

668
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:17,740
adversary and this is the optimum rate

669
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:23,168
that maximizes your net benefit so

670
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:25,570
graphically we can display that here to

671
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:27,610
look at the situation for periodic

672
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:29,379
attacker and periodic defender here got

673
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:34,020
a graph with the rate of play by the

674
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:38,080
defender 161 third one half two-thirds

675
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:40,240
rated play by the attacker and let's

676
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,918
look at first at the optimum rate of

677
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,320
play by the defender that there and we

678
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,049
just saw for the attack and I'm assuming

679
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,908
here that we've got cost of one for the

680
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:54,460
defender and cost of one-and-a-half site

681
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:56,490
for the attacker so if the attacker is

682
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:58,659
playing quickly rate a half or greater

683
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,390
then he's not leaving you intervals that

684
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:02,950
are big enough for you to play in you

685
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:07,510
shouldn't play at all your rate is zero

686
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:09,960
if the attacker is playing exactly with

687
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,830
rate a half his intervals are size two

688
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,029
doesn't matter what you play you're in

689
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:17,678
this range and if your attacker is nice

690
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:19,570
and playing slower than a half he's

691
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:24,390
living as a breathing room playing

692
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:26,500
periodically with the rate alpha 0 here

693
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:29,260
well on this curve is what you want to

694
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:32,140
be doing so this is alpha zero optimum

695
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:34,270
else's arose a function of alpha one so

696
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:37,059
this is the independent variable and

697
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:38,408
then we either he plays zero rate if

698
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:40,389
he's playing too quickly doesn't matter

699
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:44,950
here and it dumps up in him was back

700
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:47,230
down symmetrically the attacker has a

701
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:48,279
similar curve slightly offset right so

702
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:51,610
if you're playing too quickly as

703
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:55,149
defender he's got a cost of one and a

704
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:57,100
half so if he's if you're playing with

705
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:58,989
rate a third or bigger your intervals

706
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,850
are size three he's getting half of

707
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,870
those on the average so if you're

708
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:03,789
playing a third ability he has no

709
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:09,279
motivation to play whatsoever he's going

710
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:11,549
to negative benefit if you're playing

711
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,700
exactly one third

712
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:15,989
he can play anywhere in that range

713
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,679
otherwise it was just the flip of the

714
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:21,090
curvy just saw otherwise he plays like

715
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,200
this and with the question is where

716
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,639
these players going to end up playing

717
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,619
right so if you both know they're going

718
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:30,209
to play periodic strategies the Nash

719
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:32,459
equilibrium of course is where these

720
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,019
cross where they're not motivated to

721
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,309
change at all it doesn't mean they're

722
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:37,529
going to play at this Nash equilibrium

723
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:39,690
but this is what you have are you have a

724
00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:42,149
Nash equilibrium at defender playing it

725
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,220
right one third attack are playing it

726
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:49,168
right two nights and that's where these

727
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:52,889
curves cross and at this point they are

728
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:58,139
sharing the resource in the ratio of two

729
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:59,789
thirds to one third so the gamut the

730
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:01,609
gamma rates the rates of controller the

731
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:04,799
ratio of two thirds to one third the

732
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:07,320
rates of benefit are one-third and zero

733
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:11,820
so the defender is gaining here his move

734
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:13,769
costs are less he can play faster and so

735
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,570
he's getting positive benefit and he's

736
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:17,759
forcing the adversary it best to play on

737
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,678
this part of the curve here where the

738
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:23,480
adversary gets no benefit whatsoever so

739
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:27,299
he's the emissary might as well drop out

740
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,679
this is not a stable equilibrium you

741
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,940
have the defender might just play a

742
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:31,649
little bit faster and cause the

743
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,289
adversary to drop out and get more gain

744
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:36,299
but then the adversary would jump in

745
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:40,139
back in so it's not a stable situation

746
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:41,369
particularly game theory is hard to

747
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:42,449
figure out what players will actually do

748
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:43,889
when you end up with situations like

749
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:47,609
this where and maybe somebody will

750
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:51,049
invest some time to to force you out for

751
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:54,320
a while or this seems like the most

752
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:58,540
likely point for them to end up though

753
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,040
alright so that's periodic play

754
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,480
nobody said you have to play

755
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:06,670
periodically of course right so

756
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:08,710
exponential play is an interesting

757
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:14,230
possibility this is a kind of process

758
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:16,990
that is well studied because it's

759
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:19,600
memoryless right so every time you look

760
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,190
at a interval of time DT your chance of

761
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,199
playing in that time interval is the

762
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,420
same independent of what you played

763
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:30,430
previously it's just a pleasant process

764
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:32,710
you have probability of a delay X of

765
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:34,390
being at most MOS tax is going to be 1

766
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:38,020
minus e to the minus alpha 1 X for the

767
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:41,110
for the attacker all right so you looks

768
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,490
random right as it's just just raindrops

769
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,879
falling on your tin roof or whatever

770
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:48,360
that there's no correlation between them

771
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:53,680
time of one move and time of the other

772
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:56,530
and compared to the periodic display the

773
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,850
intervals are high variance right you

774
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:59,710
have mean one but you'll have variance

775
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,110
one is our standard deviation is one as

776
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,450
well so they could be high higher

777
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:08,290
variance so that makes it easier to play

778
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:12,210
in the larger gaps as we'll see so we

779
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:14,860
can make the same kind of graph for

780
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:17,110
exponential play versus exponential play

781
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:20,889
as we did for periodic play versus

782
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:23,560
periodic play and so here's a same graph

783
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:26,980
with the rates for the defender the move

784
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:28,600
rates for the attacker and let's look at

785
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,420
the defender strategy then as a function

786
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:35,850
of the attackers rate of play if the

787
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:39,280
attacker is playing at rate more than

788
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:40,570
those things like more than one then the

789
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,830
attacker is playing too quickly there's

790
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:44,950
no point in the defender playing he

791
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:46,750
won't get any benefit whatsoever but

792
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:49,720
once the attacker plays the rates lower

793
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:52,660
than one it's worthwhile for the

794
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,120
defenders to start playing we don't have

795
00:32:52,660 --> 00:33:00,550
that straight line business and curve

796
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:03,489
here here one once the mean time between

797
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:09,280
plays by the attacker is less than one

798
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:11,260
then the average waiting time average

799
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,190
control time for the defender once he

800
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:16,779
makes a move is going to

801
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:18,129
the at least one writes because it's

802
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:19,870
memoryless so that once the defender

803
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:22,480
moves the time to the next attacker move

804
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,739
is going to be at least at least one and

805
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,809
so it's going to be worth while for him

806
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:29,559
to jump in and start playing and so you

807
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:32,830
get a curve like this for the optimum

808
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:38,200
rate of play by the defender for various

809
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:40,779
rates of play by the attacker and the

810
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,120
optimum ready to play it's not hard to

811
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:44,590
figure out by the defender as a function

812
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,750
of the attackers ready to play alpha one

813
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:48,459
it's just square root of alpha 1 over K

814
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:52,029
0 minus minus alpha one that's this

815
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:56,500
group so that maximizes the net benefit

816
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:57,759
rate to the defender if the attacker has

817
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,620
these various rates so that's the curve

818
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,659
for the defenders optimum play given the

819
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,908
attackers way to play and symmetrically

820
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:05,559
or almost symmetrically I've got again a

821
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,820
slight difference because the costs are

822
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:09,279
different here for the two players the

823
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:14,020
cost of the Evis areas moves as 11 and a

824
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,369
half so his point of where starts

825
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,750
becoming worthwhile is when the defender

826
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:23,020
starts playing with rate less than two

827
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:26,619
thirds so similar kind of shape and the

828
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:33,159
Nash equilibrium for this one is where

829
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:34,869
these two curves cross is at the point

830
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,220
alpha 0 alpha 1 the two rates of six

831
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:39,250
twenty fifths and for twenty fifths

832
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:41,678
alright so and then the ratios of rates

833
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:45,250
of play correspond to the cost three to

834
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:48,668
two ratio and this equilibrium looks

835
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:52,510
like a stable one to me I think I think

836
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:53,828
that's right it looks like a you tell by

837
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,270
the slopes of these curves and whether

838
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:57,369
it's good you know a little bit a little

839
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,839
bit of deviation going to force you back

840
00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:00,369
towards it or not and this looks like a

841
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:02,950
stable equal room where is the one for

842
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:08,859
the periodic played it doesn't seem like

843
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:11,770
one so the rates of gain are again three

844
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:13,509
to two and so the defender is in control

845
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,800
sixty percent of the time the attackers

846
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:16,869
and control forty percent of the time

847
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,420
and the net benefit rates are both

848
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:21,280
positive in this case so the optimum at

849
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:24,099
the the equilibrium here they're sharing

850
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,430
the resource sixty percent forty percent

851
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:29,979
and getting both getting positive

852
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:31,180
benefits so this corresponds to the kind

853
00:35:29,979 --> 00:35:32,799
of situation where you know you're

854
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,078
living with some parasites or something

855
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:36,880
where you got some some malware it's you

856
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:39,420
know you got to live with the bad guy

857
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,380
some of the time right now that's a

858
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,700
qualitative feature of this model that

859
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,619
seems to reflect reality as well you

860
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,819
can't keep them you can't have perfect

861
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:48,069
defense you can't keep them out all the

862
00:35:45,819 --> 00:35:50,259
time but you can figure out how to play

863
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:51,880
how to adjust your strategy try to keep

864
00:35:50,259 --> 00:35:53,829
them out as much as possible and get

865
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,229
your own maximum gain considering the

866
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:58,269
cost of your moves as well so I consider

867
00:35:56,229 --> 00:36:03,700
that qualitative aspect of this you know

868
00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:06,069
reflective of reality and interesting so

869
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,779
the third kind of non adaptive strategy

870
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:09,880
is renewal strategies right so this is a

871
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:12,190
generalization of those to write both

872
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,140
periodic and exponential strategies had

873
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,519
probability distributions that said well

874
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,788
once you've made one move the time to

875
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:20,229
your next move is determined by some

876
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:21,970
probability distribution an exponential

877
00:36:20,229 --> 00:36:23,979
delay or just a fix delay in the case of

878
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,709
a periodic so in general the

879
00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:27,129
generalization of that is a renewal

880
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,930
distribution where you've got a

881
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:30,789
probabilities distribution that you can

882
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:32,379
pick whatever you like but you use it

883
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:35,319
every time after you've moved until your

884
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:37,180
next move so the probability of your

885
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:38,619
delayed being less than equal to X is

886
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,410
determined by some distribution have

887
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:44,559
survived that's unspecified and it's you

888
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:46,839
specify it to choose your moves so these

889
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:49,119
are a large class of moving strategies

890
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:51,069
and includes the periodic and

891
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,049
exponential as I said there's lots of

892
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:55,538
others if you look at the literature on

893
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:57,788
stochastic processes the term renewal

894
00:36:55,539 --> 00:37:04,569
process defines precisely this kind of a

895
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:08,650
sequence of events so one of our major

896
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:10,299
results is this one here that the if

897
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:14,859
your opponent is playing a renewal

898
00:37:10,299 --> 00:37:16,119
strategy of any sort whatsoever so as

899
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:18,538
long as if your opponent is playing a

900
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:21,640
renewal strategy you want to play a

901
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:23,559
renewal strategy yourself that optimizes

902
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,440
then you're out optimal renewal strategy

903
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:30,519
is going to be periodic or maybe not

904
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:32,490
playing if he's playing too quickly so

905
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:34,439
periodic play

906
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:40,740
in the case of non-adaptive play is in

907
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:42,600
fact optimal for non-adaptive playing it

908
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:47,520
right or at least for renewal plane all

909
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:50,339
right so we got you might think that

910
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,840
having more unpredictability would be

911
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,310
helpful but in fact we're talking about

912
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,080
non-adaptive play here where the players

913
00:37:53,310 --> 00:38:00,170
don't see how you're playing and so

914
00:37:55,080 --> 00:38:03,240
periodic plays is fine the proofs notes

915
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:04,800
is this nice classic exercise and

916
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,479
statistics about the waiting time for

917
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,570
the bus versus the average time between

918
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,190
the buses right so you go to a bus stop

919
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:14,040
right if the buses come periodically

920
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,510
every 10 minutes and you go to the bus

921
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,779
stop then it's going to be five minutes

922
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:20,160
to the bus arrives but if you go to the

923
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,650
if the buses arrive with some other

924
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,589
distribution you know the average time

925
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:27,030
between buses and the average time you

926
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,560
have to wait for the bus if you when you

927
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,940
arrive at the bus stop those are

928
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,520
different random variables are related

929
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,670
and the one you care about really is the

930
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,050
average time to wait for the bus the

931
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:39,000
average time till the attacker moves you

932
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:40,200
through the defender so these are

933
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,540
different distributions in the case of

934
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,220
the exponential right i mean the average

935
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,020
time between them is the same as the

936
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,700
amount you have to wait as i said once

937
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,200
you arrive there it's a memoryless

938
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,118
process of the every time to the next

939
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,220
bus is the average time between us

940
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,869
because the average time between from

941
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:58,649
any given point to the next one is the

942
00:38:54,869 --> 00:39:01,170
same so most of the analysis has to do

943
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:03,240
with the waiting time which if you flip

944
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:06,540
it around as the time since the last one

945
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:10,069
to size biased interval sizes what we

946
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:12,029
call them will they usually called and

947
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:14,280
one of the key insights is that a

948
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:15,950
periodic strategy minimizes the variance

949
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,670
of the interval size so if the adversary

950
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:24,029
steps in the middle of a interval then

951
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:25,380
you minimize his expected gain by having

952
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,900
a periodic strategy because then it will

953
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,780
his waiting time will be precisely one

954
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:32,550
half of your interval size whereas if

955
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:35,070
you've got some variants some positive

956
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:37,260
variance in your move sizes you're

957
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,880
giving him because of the difference

958
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,380
between these two notions you're giving

959
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,509
him some benefit and he will

960
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,160
will gain so minimizing the variance in

961
00:39:42,509 --> 00:39:46,619
your moves turns out to be a good

962
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,170
intuitive strategy so I won't give you

963
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:54,529
the details of the proof but those are

964
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:59,250
some of the notions so adaptive play so

965
00:39:54,529 --> 00:40:05,480
adaptive play is hard this is a tough

966
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:09,799
game for that because we saw periodic

967
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:13,019
periodic play isn't very effective that

968
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:15,170
learning adversary can just learn you

969
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:18,779
know what your period is your phase and

970
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:20,460
defeat you so you're going to play

971
00:40:18,779 --> 00:40:23,849
against an adaptive adversary which what

972
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:26,460
should you do well if both players are

973
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:28,799
adaptive it's not hard to at least

974
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,630
intuitively see that we've got a game

975
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:32,430
it's at least as complicated as iterated

976
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:35,339
prisoner's dilemma there you're ranked

977
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,690
if you've got a situation where both

978
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:40,589
players can learn what the other player

979
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:42,000
is doing they can compete in interesting

980
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:44,460
ways they can also cooperate in

981
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,170
interesting ways prisoner's dilemma is

982
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:52,289
the classic game where players can

983
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:54,569
cooperate or defect and and if you play

984
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:56,400
prisoners limit lemonade iterated away

985
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:58,349
Axelrod is a nice book talking about

986
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,549
strategies for playing iterated

987
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:01,859
prisoner's dilemma you can do

988
00:40:59,549 --> 00:41:03,180
tit-for-tat or you where you play the

989
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:08,519
same way that you cooperate or defect

990
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:12,118
the previous round so here you can view

991
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:16,140
it as being very similar with slow and

992
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:17,549
fast being very much like cooperate and

993
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,160
defect right so if you have a choice

994
00:41:17,549 --> 00:41:22,799
between say playing slow at rate Oh

995
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,129
point one say playing on the average

996
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:27,240
once every ten moves and fast where

997
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:31,259
you're playing point2 you're playing

998
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:35,368
once every five and the attacker and the

999
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:36,599
defenders got the same choices and they

1000
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:38,220
were playing periodically say just

1001
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:41,490
restricting it to those two strategies

1002
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:43,828
so here's the payoffs for the defender

1003
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:46,439
point four point five five in the case

1004
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:47,880
of the attackers playing slow your bet

1005
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,430
the defender is better off playing

1006
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,710
faster he'll increases gain from point 4

1007
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:53,089
2.5

1008
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:56,330
and similarly if the attackers playing

1009
00:41:53,089 --> 00:42:00,080
fast the defender is still better

1010
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:03,259
playing off fast himself so he's goes

1011
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,460
from minus point 1 2.3 so from the

1012
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,990
defenders point of view it's always

1013
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:10,339
better to play fast that's a dominant

1014
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:11,540
strategy and it's the metrics here I got

1015
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:13,910
the cost being the same for both players

1016
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,670
so from the attackers point of view he's

1017
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:17,810
better off playing fast the first row

1018
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,849
and better off playing fast in the

1019
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,320
second second row so this is a classic

1020
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:25,820
prisoners Damona kind of two by two

1021
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:27,320
matrix and you have all the richness and

1022
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:31,820
complexity than of iterators pretty

1023
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:33,500
cooperative play slowly right so you

1024
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:36,650
doing an adaptive game they can say well

1025
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,450
let the adversary take over my machine

1026
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:39,770
on weekends when I don't care anyway

1027
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:44,450
then I'll take over whatever they can

1028
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:48,140
cooperate in various ways so it's

1029
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:51,500
complex nonetheless as a defender you

1030
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:55,009
can say well how do I deal with an

1031
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:56,510
adaptive adversary I've got a attacker

1032
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,970
who's going to try to figure out what

1033
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:01,010
i'm doing and i'm sending the sentries

1034
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,720
out he's going to be watching them what

1035
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:04,160
kind of pattern should i send those

1036
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:08,830
centuries out on he's going to try to

1037
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,830
figure out the pattern of play

1038
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:18,180
so exponential is a pretty good strategy

1039
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,740
for this in this case right so

1040
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,259
exponential means you're acting in a

1041
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,490
fear the defender you're acting in a

1042
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:26,640
memoryless manner so there's nothing

1043
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:31,350
really for the opponent to learn except

1044
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:33,810
your average rate of play so if you're

1045
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:36,060
playing an exponential strategy then as

1046
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:39,830
we saw earlier the optimum strategy for

1047
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:45,450
the attacker is to play periodically or

1048
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:48,779
not not to play at all so adaptivity

1049
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:49,919
doesn't help if you're playing with an

1050
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,290
exponential strategy because there's

1051
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,270
nothing to learn except you're ready to

1052
00:43:52,290 --> 00:44:01,020
play and that's that's fixed so there's

1053
00:43:54,270 --> 00:44:04,200
no more so graphically the situation

1054
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:07,710
looks like this right you have the

1055
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,660
defender here here they give you give up

1056
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:11,670
something by playing exponentially but

1057
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,470
maybe not that much all right so here's

1058
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:14,700
a graph that shows the defender you're

1059
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:19,129
the defender you're playing a trait

1060
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:21,330
point 25 site so you're committed to

1061
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:22,950
spending at that rake just to get it to

1062
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:26,520
make the graph two-dimensional so I've

1063
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:29,189
got a your rate is fixed and let's start

1064
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:32,940
off with the case where the attacker is

1065
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:34,290
playing periodically with a rate of area

1066
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,640
so here we've got the independent

1067
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:38,310
variable which is the attackers right so

1068
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,830
this is alpha 1 not alpha 0 so as the

1069
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:42,900
attacker plays faster your net benefit

1070
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:45,000
you're the defender as beta 0 unit but

1071
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,520
if your net benefit goes from about

1072
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,440
three quarters down to zero you're right

1073
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,670
so is he plays faster you're gaining

1074
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,490
less and less of course and eventually

1075
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:58,410
you'll you'll drop out at this point as

1076
00:44:53,490 --> 00:45:00,180
we saw so that's a non-adaptive attacker

1077
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:04,460
right and as he plays faster you're

1078
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:07,350
doing worse according to this curve if

1079
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:10,380
you see that like greens okay so if he's

1080
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:11,730
adaptive you say oh goodness I've got an

1081
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,950
adaptive attacker what do i do well I

1082
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:15,410
can play exponentially I can have a

1083
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,250
memory less attack at the same rate

1084
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:19,049
remember with strategy at the same rate

1085
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:22,170
and now my benefit curve starts looking

1086
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:23,300
like this I pay the penalty by becoming

1087
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,010
adapted right so I've

1088
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:28,970
gonna curve that starts off at the same

1089
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:30,320
point here but it there's a gap but he

1090
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:31,790
can't do any better than this this is

1091
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,860
something i can guarantee even with the

1092
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:35,090
best adaptive attacker independent of

1093
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,490
complexity theoretical assumptions or

1094
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:40,030
anything else right just inserting my

1095
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:46,939
moving means that i can guarantee

1096
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:49,730
benefit at this rate for for myself no

1097
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,990
matter how the attacker plays so i paid

1098
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:56,240
a penalty because he's going to become

1099
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:57,439
adaptive I'd become exponential and one

1100
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,839
of the big open questions here's is

1101
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:03,220
there a better defender what can be

1102
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:06,740
argued and what is there an optimum

1103
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:07,549
defense strategy I think there's got to

1104
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:10,339
be things that are better I don't know

1105
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:13,100
how to prove them yep but it seems like

1106
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:15,620
there should be curves in between these

1107
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:17,660
two so given a fully adaptive attacker

1108
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:20,750
they can do whatever he likes the

1109
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:22,609
exponential defender has a lot of

1110
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:24,530
variance in his moves it's memoryless

1111
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:26,390
which makes it easy to argue that the

1112
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,500
adaptive strategy is gonna help much but

1113
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:31,009
it's also got a lot of variance in the

1114
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:34,310
moves and as you want to move towards

1115
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:36,230
the periodic rate of gain here you think

1116
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:37,520
cutting the variance down so using other

1117
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:40,280
kinds of variables may be gamma

1118
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,690
distributions or or something else may

1119
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,460
be waiting a bit and then just doing a

1120
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,800
little normal curve or some things you

1121
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,420
got it's a bit like periodic but a

1122
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,430
little more variance in periodic so it's

1123
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:53,240
unpredictable how do you trade those two

1124
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:55,009
off the predictability you know variance

1125
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:57,410
trade off yours is the important one so

1126
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:58,850
we've got to 2n two extremes the

1127
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:00,560
periodic defender and the exponential

1128
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,640
defender there's got to be interesting

1129
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:06,549
things in the middle that should be

1130
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:10,210
analyzable that's an open question so

1131
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:10,210
lessons and open questions

1132
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:18,869
so I think you know we can't just stick

1133
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,828
with imagino lying philosophy in this

1134
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:23,640
community we've really got to be

1135
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:28,410
prepared to to deal with total loss of

1136
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:31,109
key material repeatedly you know I think

1137
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:33,509
I think that the world has shown is that

1138
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:36,420
you know labeling something as a secret

1139
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:37,950
key isn't sufficient and that just

1140
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,630
because you've labeled as the secret key

1141
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:41,700
and you've given it to the systems guys

1142
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:42,660
and said you know keep that secret that

1143
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,618
doesn't mean it's going to work very

1144
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:48,920
well and we've seen lots of cases where

1145
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:55,140
secrets can get compromised repeatedly

1146
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:56,819
so I'm not sure how we as cryptographers

1147
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,290
can help that we have to be prepared for

1148
00:47:56,819 --> 00:48:00,119
dealing with that assumption in

1149
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:02,520
particular as being a particularly weak

1150
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:03,960
one I think our other assumptions of

1151
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,720
come a computational complexity I think

1152
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:10,770
are much stronger but the ability to

1153
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:13,020
keep secrets is one that we should think

1154
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:15,630
harder about and be better prepared to

1155
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:19,980
deal with with models like this or

1156
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:23,810
others play fast all right so if you're

1157
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:26,040
in this kind of situation you want to

1158
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:30,509
play quickly you want to force the other

1159
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:32,490
player to drop out if possible so change

1160
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:35,940
your passwords frequently reboot your

1161
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:37,950
server frequently that's good play in

1162
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,810
your part in the sense that it makes it

1163
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:42,089
harder for the adversary and he may drop

1164
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:45,440
out you may I mean there's optimizations

1165
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:48,810
to do of course two and one of the big

1166
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,390
lessons here I think the big morals for

1167
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:52,950
me anyway is we should be paying more

1168
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:55,230
attention to these caught the costs of

1169
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:57,299
these moves right because the costs are

1170
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,880
going to be driving everything so what's

1171
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:03,329
the cost of changing your password

1172
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:05,849
what's the cost of putting your system

1173
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:08,790
into a clean state you want to arrange

1174
00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:11,369
the game so that your costs are so fit

1175
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:13,710
and the other players costs all right so

1176
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:14,790
these are system kinds of questions and

1177
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:17,250
we're seeing progress in that direction

1178
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:20,579
the use of virtual machines to give you

1179
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:23,560
a fresh image of your system easily and

1180
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:27,700
quickly means you as a defender have a

1181
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:29,900
move costs because when you when your

1182
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,040
costs are cheaper than the opponent's

1183
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,450
costs you can move more quickly than

1184
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,770
they can you can force them to drop out

1185
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:39,370
and get essentially full benefit so this

1186
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:41,330
is immoral maybe not so much for

1187
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:42,950
Austin's cryptographers but for the

1188
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:46,250
system security folks to say and how do

1189
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:48,950
we think harder about getting a system

1190
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:53,660
back to a good state cheaply that's the

1191
00:49:48,950 --> 00:50:03,080
key operation here so uh some open

1192
00:49:53,660 --> 00:50:04,940
questions so we proved that the optimal

1193
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:09,110
renewal strategy against a renewal

1194
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:10,910
strategy is periodic it's not quite the

1195
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:13,820
same as proving that the optimal not

1196
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:16,040
adaptive strategy against a renewal

1197
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:18,040
strategy is periodic right so renewal is

1198
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,840
a subclass of non-adaptive right and

1199
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:22,580
they're maybe not adaptive strategies

1200
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,140
the art renewal strategies that are do

1201
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:26,690
better against a renewal strategy but

1202
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:28,279
there's a gap there what we were able to

1203
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,740
show is we only analyzed renewal

1204
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,110
strategies against renewal strategies

1205
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:35,450
what's the best non adaptive strategy

1206
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:36,650
against an arbitrary renewal strategy

1207
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:39,370
the conjecture is that that's also

1208
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,370
periodic

1209
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:48,570
what's the optimal renewal strategy

1210
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:50,040
against say maybe an adaptive rate

1211
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:52,220
limited adversary something there's a

1212
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,540
bound of how fast the adversary can move

1213
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:57,930
say and then you want to say what's the

1214
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:59,279
best way to move yourself given that

1215
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,890
he's adapted he can learn what you're

1216
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,790
doing and again this goes back to the

1217
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:06,109
interpolating between those two curves

1218
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:08,850
trying to find a way of balancing the

1219
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:10,200
predictability of having a periodic play

1220
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:12,360
which is nice because it's got small

1221
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,500
variance and unpredictability with

1222
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:19,910
higher variance but then it gives more

1223
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:22,680
gaps for the adversary to fit into so

1224
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:24,390
gamma distribution stupid variables

1225
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,609
gamut variables is the sum of a number

1226
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:28,370
of exponential variables he seems to

1227
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:30,990
have a nice class of properties that

1228
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:32,580
would conjecture would maybe be a good

1229
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:34,950
answer here but they're hard to analyze

1230
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:37,440
because once you get away from the

1231
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:38,730
memoryless property then adaptive what's

1232
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,690
you know what's the best adapt to play

1233
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:49,170
against such a strategy it's not easy to

1234
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:50,910
think about if you play a fixed renewal

1235
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:52,260
strategy like some combination of

1236
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:55,980
exponential and something else maybe

1237
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:57,600
what's the best can you lower bound how

1238
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,550
well an adaptive adversary can do

1239
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:03,509
against the question of analysis how do

1240
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:05,040
you analyze best possible adaptive play

1241
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:06,330
against a given strategy that you're

1242
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,820
announced asleep I like to adopt this

1243
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:11,910
strategy of you know half the time

1244
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:13,320
moving in three steps and that's the

1245
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,910
time moving in five or something how do

1246
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,360
you analyze what the adversary can do

1247
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:17,359
against them

1248
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:22,060
what learning theory algorithms so how

1249
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,380
do we develop good adaptive strategies I

1250
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,790
think there's a lot a lot of room to be

1251
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:28,599
done here some of the reinforcement

1252
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:32,550
learning literature yields strategies

1253
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:34,690
which may be applicable here time delay

1254
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:36,040
TV learning and some of these other ones

1255
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:37,900
though look that they might apply to

1256
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:40,029
this sort of game a bit depending on the

1257
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:43,000
strategy that you're playing is it with

1258
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:45,190
the renewal strategy other open

1259
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,420
questions the game generalized in lots

1260
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:49,119
of ways you could have multiple players

1261
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:51,810
of course past could be controlled by

1262
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:54,670
any one of three players you hear of

1263
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:56,529
software that malware that boots out the

1264
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:58,540
other malware then takes over the

1265
00:52:56,530 --> 00:53:02,380
Machine rescue now we're one male or two

1266
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:05,770
and then use a defender other feedback

1267
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:07,660
models so the game here's was the

1268
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:09,040
simplest possible one you play you take

1269
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:10,330
control and you learn everything about

1270
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:14,170
the game there but you could have other

1271
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:16,840
feedback models you could have a model

1272
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:18,400
as as you just learn whether you had

1273
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:22,630
weather was a flip or flop when you move

1274
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:25,540
for example we're a low-cost check right

1275
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:27,190
maybe one that's here it's could have a

1276
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:29,560
second kind of movie and one that takes

1277
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:32,290
control Yuri flasher system but you

1278
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:34,060
could have a virus Chapman says is it

1279
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:35,800
infected what's the state is a good

1280
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:38,440
state of bed state so maybe that's cheap

1281
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,720
and it cost you a lot more to this makes

1282
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,170
the game harder to think about of course

1283
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:47,169
but maybe a little more realistic how to

1284
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:48,160
structure a pki when anybody can get

1285
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:49,510
hacked I think this is an interesting

1286
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,490
direction they're going right so we've

1287
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:55,359
got PK eyes right now that assume

1288
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:58,540
there's there's a trusted third parties

1289
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,589
that don't get hacked maybe that's right

1290
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:02,890
maybe they don't get hacked they put a

1291
00:53:59,589 --> 00:54:04,630
lot of effort into to managing the

1292
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:09,490
security of their route keys and so on

1293
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:12,930
but think about a world in which anybody

1294
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:15,970
can get hacked and any key can be

1295
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:17,770
compromised and you want to have a move

1296
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:20,348
in which refreshes it reestablishes it's

1297
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:22,390
good character and how do you build a

1298
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:25,270
public key infrastructure in such a

1299
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:27,460
world and this might be a way to come up

1300
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:29,650
with a much more robust pki I mean right

1301
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:30,730
now the ones we have feel somewhat

1302
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:32,470
fragile and

1303
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:34,119
and brittle and maybe one where you're

1304
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:38,080
constantly changing your keys actually

1305
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:43,030
is a way to having a more lively and

1306
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:45,310
secure and robust kind of system so

1307
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,930
there may be a interactive version of

1308
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:48,910
this game the folks at RSA we're working

1309
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:50,560
on some implementations not ready yet a

1310
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:54,940
paper will be posted on this stuff at

1311
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:56,200
the site as well but be a fun game for a

1312
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,670
nap I think you have to tootle

1313
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,439
smartphones and you're pushing your

1314
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:01,270
buttons to take control right I think

1315
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:06,010
anybody wants to implement that let me

1316
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:07,690
know if you it may happen so that's it

1317
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:10,990
basically I wanted to cover a little bit

1318
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:12,850
early but so I hope you found the themes

1319
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:14,200
interesting I think there's a set of

1320
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:16,000
questions that we're not asking in this

1321
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,560
community about dealing with total key

1322
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,119
loss and I hope that this will stimulate

1323
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,770
you to think about these directions

1324
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,850
thank you very much for your attention

1325
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:23,850
thank you

1326
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:43,260
any questions for wrong thanks Ron this

1327
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,430
this is fascinating really feels like

1328
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,520
the beginning of a whole new line of

1329
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:48,569
research and it seems like it can be

1330
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,330
taken in so many different directions

1331
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:54,480
and one that I wonder if you've thought

1332
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:58,680
about is the possibility of the attacker

1333
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:01,710
and defender having different goals an

1334
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:06,720
example might be where my goal is to get

1335
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:08,520
my banking done and the attackers goal

1336
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,109
is to just run a botnet for as long as

1337
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:12,840
possible so I'm like burning a malware

1338
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:14,550
scan right before my banking knowing

1339
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,140
that the attacker will own the my

1340
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,610
machine most of the time when we're both

1341
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:21,180
relatively happy under those

1342
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:22,050
circumstances good question I hadn't we

1343
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,549
hadn't thought about that kind of thing

1344
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:27,840
but we're trying to keep it the first

1345
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:29,130
model as simple as possible but the

1346
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,190
questions what is what are the simple

1347
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:32,970
next steps for the foot modeling and

1348
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:43,020
that's one direction we hadn't thought

1349
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:46,890
about okay thanks any other questions so

1350
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:48,450
lunch or just be all hungry so let's

1351
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:50,960
thank run again for a very interesting

1352
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,960
and thought-provoking

1353
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,009
you
