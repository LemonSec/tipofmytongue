1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:06,810
it's my pleasure to announce our next

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:09,000
invited speaker but preneur from Calvin

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,769
so Bart is best known for his work on

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,269
symmetric cryptography for analyzing

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,950
crypt analyzing and constructing many

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,430
schemes in fact there will be a talk

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,900
later today on his work on P Mac and

8
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,820
Bart has been the president of the I ACR

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,859
in the past and he will now tell us

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,920
about the future of cryptography

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,920
so please welcome party

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,190
morning everybody

13
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:42,489
I would like to thank the ICR board

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,079
between inviting me to give this lecture

15
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:50,000
if you look at the previous list of

16
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,860
English lectures it's a great honor the

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
people I really admire and they're my

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,629
role models and it's I will do my best

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,860
to step in their footsteps I also would

20
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:59,059
like to thank all of you because I'm not

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,260
the morning person so I know how

22
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,239
difficult it can be to get up in the

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,000
morning and give talks so I'm very happy

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,360
that you actually woke up and came to

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,590
this talk and when I was invited I

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,439
really was thinking I should talk about

27
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:15,650
hash functions like a topic near and

28
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:18,048
dear to my heart I've been working on

29
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,570
this more than 25 years but then after

30
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:22,159
seeing Phil Rockaways talk the thing we

31
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,330
select you had a check whipped I decided

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,299
I would speak about the future of

33
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,130
cryptography and give a less technical

34
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:29,960
talk so there will be no equations on

35
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,589
the slides and very little technical

36
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:37,249
information so who has an iPhone here in

37
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,259
the room good so there is actually a

38
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:41,210
great advantage now after the Snowden

39
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:42,859
revelations we cryptographers don't have

40
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:48,280
to make our own slides anymore the NSA

41
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:52,729
make them for us so who knew in 1984

42
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:55,640
that this would be big rubber and the

43
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:58,130
zombies would be paying customers maybe

44
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,249
I should emphasize this the NSA calls

45
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:03,920
iPhone users public zombies who pay for

46
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:05,899
their own surveillance and by the way

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,160
it's the same for Android users and even

48
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:12,290
for Windows mobile phone users so

49
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,240
another way to summarize no revelations

50
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:20,510
is that what the NSA does collect it all

51
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,700
know it all and exploit it all and maybe

52
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,470
about the knowing part collecting we

53
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,060
knew a lot but I think the exploiting

54
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,100
was probably something that surprised us

55
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,510
so I'm doing this talk is I go a little

56
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,950
bit more in detail on the Snowden

57
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,079
revelations I try to give you an update

58
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,190
it's it will be not that as long as some

59
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,480
of the other talks I've given about this

60
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,240
just a couple of slides to give you an

61
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,738
idea I will particularly talk about how

62
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,000
the NSA goes after crypto because I

63
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:42,560
think as cryptographers is very

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,780
important for us to understand how our

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,850
crypto is being undermined

66
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,830
and then I'll speak about the ends of

67
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,420
crypto there was actually a talk at

68
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,670
crypto by Zittrain a couple of years ago

69
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,720
with the same title and in my talk it

70
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,399
means the same thing

71
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,440
it doesn't mean crypto is over it means

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,190
what is the goal of crypto and then I'll

73
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,230
discuss challenges for research so if

74
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,390
you look at the NSA parking lot or you

75
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,130
visit NSA Museum and you read the books

76
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,329
that were available you should not be so

77
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,850
surprised about the surveillance

78
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,170
capabilities but still I think most of

79
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,000
us were surprised by the massive scale

80
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,739
and impact and how competent these

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,310
people are in doing what they task to do

82
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:20,320
which is spy on everybody so they're

83
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:24,820
very sophisticated both technically and

84
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:27,239
organizationally they actually do

85
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:30,040
something which we teach our students

86
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,590
defense-in-depth well the NSA has

87
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,989
offense in depth we found out at least

88
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,239
three independent ways the NSA had to

89
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:39,070
get access to Google data so even if one

90
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,840
gets blocked by technology or bio law

91
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,250
they still have two hours left and maybe

92
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,110
there is always we don't know about even

93
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:49,090
today of course because of Snowden

94
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,280
because he was working for the NSA we

95
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,860
know more about the NSA and GCHQ but of

96
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,930
course many countries collaborated and

97
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,640
there is an economy of scale element

98
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,260
here as a small nation you can't

99
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,670
actually run such an operation by

100
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,920
yourself so you give your data to the

101
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:06,070
NSA in exchange you can expect something

102
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,720
back some questions you can answer for

103
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,250
your own purpose and this is typically

104
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,930
governed by secret treaties so we don't

105
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,190
know much about this and we need not a

106
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,070
Snowden if we really want to find out

107
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,570
what's happened maybe more surprising

108
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,519
for most is that industry it was in some

109
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,320
way collaborating as a mechanism we were

110
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,000
not aware of Security Letters where a

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,729
company can be told to give up certain

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,840
data or certain keys and they cannot

113
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,909
talk about it if they talk about it

114
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,179
actually the CEO goes to jail so he will

115
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,680
make sure nobody talks about this and

116
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,330
then of course we also learned about

117
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,430
undermining cryptographic standards and

118
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,890
at the same time also the credibility of

119
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:43,000
NIST it may be the more spectacular

120
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:46,330
thing is what's called active defense so

121
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,740
in fact if you go to trade shows after

122
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,599
the stone revelation many companies

123
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,010
already have copied the same term and

124
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,530
they say use the same thing we offer you

125
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,750
actively fans but in NSA speak active

126
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,049
defense means hacking everybody that's

127
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,720
what it means

128
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:03,349
so I guess many of you have heard about

129
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,120
quantum insertion it's nothing to do

130
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:07,669
with quantum computers but it's a clever

131
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,220
way to actually get access to somebody's

132
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:13,068
machine what you do is if somebody goes

133
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,259
to Google or Facebook you actually as

134
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:17,840
the NSA you sent the answer before

135
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:20,810
Google or Facebook and by being faster

136
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,099
you can actually make the client believe

137
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,990
he's at Google or Facebook you can then

138
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:25,849
send him malware and take control of

139
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,770
this machine it's actually quite easy to

140
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:29,569
detect this attack because a bit later

141
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,099
the Google come answer will come but

142
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:32,449
it's not clear whether I still use it

143
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:34,699
but at least it has been very effective

144
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:36,229
there was even a whole quantum program

145
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,400
nothing to do with quantum technologies

146
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:39,530
and I don't want you to read everything

147
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,090
but the bottom point is here the

148
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,068
replication delay from tip to target

149
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,679
determines a success rate of the network

150
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:47,509
effect less latency is more success so

151
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,039
the NSA takes over your machine by being

152
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:54,139
faster than Google or faster than

153
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:56,210
Facebook of course once they do this

154
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:59,000
they use zero days to take control of

155
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,948
your machine and maybe if you never put

156
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,900
your machine on the internet they put in

157
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:04,940
ships during transportation supply chain

158
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,758
of subversion it also been quite popular

159
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,560
so I think if you read that the early

160
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,599
protocol papers from dole F and Yahoo

161
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,550
they introduced this dole fer attacker

162
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:14,659
and it kind of was a nice thing for our

163
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,009
papers but I think what we learned from

164
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:17,930
Snowden documents is that the dollar fee

165
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,610
our opponent exists there is somebody

166
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,139
controlling all our communications and

167
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,259
it's not just a game it's actually

168
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:27,080
reality ok of course after the document

169
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:31,580
is no longer deniable and we also know

170
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,529
the oversight has been very weak so when

171
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,449
I attended a crypto protocols workshop

172
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:38,300
in the early 90s in Cambridge but

173
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:40,639
Maurice gave a talk it was at that time

174
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,319
the head of technical I think of crypto

175
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,180
at the NSA he was the father also of the

176
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,289
guy who wrote Internet worm gave a very

177
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,580
interesting talk and I think in

178
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:48,889
retrospect I should have paid even more

179
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,568
attention but one thing he said is rule

180
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:52,190
on one of cryptanalysis look for plain

181
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:54,710
text because people actually don't

182
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,599
encrypt and so where do you find

183
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,789
plaintext well of course we are all

184
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:00,289
addicted now to cloud services so in

185
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:01,818
fact we put all our data in the cloud

186
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:03,620
and the prison program revealed in the

187
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,320
first week of stone revelations in June

188
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,940
2013 showed that in fact the NSA in some

189
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,530
way access to all those company's data

190
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,030
in the cloud

191
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,099
we still don't know how the how the

192
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,260
access exactly works is it's real time

193
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,180
and what is the capacity but we know

194
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,030
that the NSA does have access to all

195
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,460
cloud data which is which we all put

196
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,049
there the other slide very famous is

197
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,909
upstream of course we know for a long

198
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,800
time that the NSA and others had tapping

199
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,210
all communications and actually own

200
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
investigation European Parliament is an

201
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,969
example of this but this slide is

202
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,580
particularly interesting it says to the

203
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,800
analyst you should use both so you not

204
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,630
only used terabytes of data coming in to

205
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,860
upstream but you should also use prism

206
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:44,450
and combine the results this light is

207
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,250
kind of informative because it shows you

208
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,750
which companies are collaborating when I

209
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,340
don't think these dates really matter

210
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,640
but I think the fact is that they're all

211
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,590
there is more important this light of

212
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,030
course must have upset Google a lot it

213
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,710
shows one way the NSA like to do

214
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,299
Google's data I guess Google was

215
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,039
particularly upset about this smiley

216
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,330
here so it actually happened is that

217
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,220
Google was encrypting between the user

218
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,530
and the Google front end but then in the

219
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,130
back office all the collects me in the

220
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,900
backbone

221
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,130
we're actually eavesdrop not by the NSA

222
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,280
but like DC HQ I'm at the muscular

223
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,719
program and so you can bet that people

224
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,799
who sell encryption boxes have done good

225
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,180
business in the last years to now

226
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,640
encrypt those lines so that's probably

227
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:25,070
what's something that has been blocked

228
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:27,800
off and third thing is metadata in NSA

229
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:30,469
speak is DNR diagram recognition from

230
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,169
the vault phone days so what is metadata

231
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,330
metadata is not plain text but which

232
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,549
website do you visit MAC addresses IP

233
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,740
addresses location information enclosed

234
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:42,439
attach to map networks and to reveal

235
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,690
social relations and by the way I guess

236
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,370
if you bring your phone I broke my phone

237
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,839
here it's probably other people here on

238
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,670
a watch list by being in this room for

239
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,430
an hour you probably end up on another

240
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,209
list just based on this technology

241
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,000
should have told you should have left

242
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,839
your phone in your hotel room

243
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,830
don't take your phone if you go to

244
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,240
cryptic office to the two sessions so in

245
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,060
the first week of stone revelations it

246
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,950
was leaked that actually the NSA was

247
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,959
also spying on Verizon customers by

248
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,880
collecting their metadata and this made

249
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,800
the US citizens very upset because the

250
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,990
NSA is paid to spy on everybody else

251
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,750
except the Americans and so in fact the

252
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,880
NSA overstepped their rules and was also

253
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,860
collecting metadata on people in the US

254
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,600
and on US citizens which was not allowed

255
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,880
okay

256
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,220
so last summer although was passed we

257
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,750
became effect in November 2015 and so

258
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,610
the NSA's no.1 we're allowed to collect

259
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,980
this both the telephony data this data

260
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,660
now stays to me the telcos and the NSA

261
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,610
has to go to a FISA Court to get x2 the

262
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,189
data

263
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,780
be very careful it's only telephony data

264
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,340
your internet data this is still not

265
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,199
specified what is happening there is it

266
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,660
collected or not I don't know the answer

267
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,100
but I have a guess now Europeans were of

268
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,010
course the first to point fingers

269
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:55,400
fingers at the NSA and GCHQ but then in

270
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,990
Europe 10 years ago our Parliament voted

271
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,510
the data retention directive which

272
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:02,240
actually forces all telco operators to

273
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,680
collect exactly the same data and so

274
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,420
somebody went to court about this and

275
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,310
the highest European Court European

276
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,500
Court of Justice ruled about two years

277
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,510
ago that collecting all metadata about

278
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,120
everybody it's completely

279
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:17,300
disproportionate and actually violates

280
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,180
fundamental rights what was the response

281
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,829
of the countries within a few months UK

282
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,180
had a new law and all the other

283
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,550
countries shrug their shoulders and just

284
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,069
move on the highest court says something

285
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:31,490
which is inconvenient just ignore it and

286
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,630
if if you are if we get annoyed citizens

287
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,160
just fought a new law and then take a

288
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,540
procedure of 2 or 2 years it's necessary

289
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,130
to vote that down again so our

290
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,410
governments are extremely cynical in

291
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,030
their response to this so Obama of

292
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,130
course felt with this in about the

293
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,390
Verizon case and so he went on public

294
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,950
and said we're not listening to your

295
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,860
phone calls this was with US citizens of

296
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,900
course it's only the metadata now

297
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,060
unfortunately a few months later general

298
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:56,209
Hayden gave a speech and he said we kill

299
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,920
people based on metadata now you can go

300
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:00,200
read the speech and a bit further he

301
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,530
says but that's not what we do with this

302
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:07,570
metadata that gets a really big comfort

303
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:10,459
to me ok then the fourth thing so we had

304
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:13,100
prism yep communications we had the

305
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,810
metadata is the client systems I already

306
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,650
mentioned the hacking the exploiting of

307
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:20,209
devices and then at Christmas 2014 we go

308
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,699
from - beagle a very nice present a

309
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,980
whole catalogue of what the NSA calls a

310
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,810
oat axis operation or tau a lot of

311
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,110
devices that can actually be implanted

312
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:32,270
on motherboards or in pcs or in routers

313
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,100
to actually remotely eat up on devices

314
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,020
that never touch the internet you can

315
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,279
find the complete specs how they

316
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,079
communicate with it how much they

317
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,069
than how many they produce it's really

318
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:41,959
if you're a hacker it's really

319
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:43,279
fascinating reading these guys really

320
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,819
had good tools and they probably have

321
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,259
now even better tools so once you have

322
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:50,209
all this stuff what can you do with it

323
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:51,589
well it goes into a system called

324
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,319
temporal GCHQ

325
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:56,029
oh excuse core deep dive for the NSA and

326
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:58,339
you can ask very interesting questions

327
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:00,199
for example I find one phone number in

328
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:02,749
case of a terrorist attack you can find

329
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:04,008
all the devices of this person their MAC

330
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:05,269
address is the IP address is their

331
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:07,699
location and who they talk to

332
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:09,379
it's incredibly powerful - after an

333
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:10,699
attack actually trace the network and

334
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:14,269
we've seen this in the recent attacks

335
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:16,069
that actually I think in general police

336
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:17,959
was very quick in finding other people

337
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:20,360
in the network and who supply to network

338
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:23,239
and so on you could also if you want to

339
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,249
hack say Belgium in Belgium because they

340
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,499
have access to interesting data you can

341
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:29,870
say give me all Microsoft Excel sheets

342
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:32,029
containing MAC addresses in Belgium

343
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,759
because actually this admins tend to

344
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:35,660
collect MAC addresses in Excel sheets

345
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,970
you could also say give me all

346
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,139
exploitable machines in Panama if you

347
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,600
want to get them interesting information

348
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:43,550
there because every time a machine in

349
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,660
Panama does an update and it fails the

350
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:49,399
NSA finds out before Microsoft does or

351
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,870
you can say give me everybody in Austria

352
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,389
who just happen to speak French and

353
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,949
actually uses tools like OTR or signal

354
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:57,529
and you can get all the information on

355
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:59,809
those people so the NSA and GCHQ they

356
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:00,740
call this tackler surveillance but they

357
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:02,930
first feel like everything about

358
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,059
everybody and they say because we only

359
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:09,589
have target questions believe us we're

360
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:11,269
honest this is actually fine this system

361
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,709
is very attractive and what we learned

362
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:16,189
from Snowden documents is that actually

363
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:17,959
the German national secrecy service the

364
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:20,000
Buddhists African dienst was actually

365
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:22,790
spying on European but also German

366
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,939
companies German citizens on behalf of

367
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,439
the NSA and GCHQ and the exchange they

368
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:30,110
got access to those systems at tempura

369
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:31,429
systems so our secret services are so

370
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,540
desperate to get this data that they

371
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:34,519
even willing to spy on their own

372
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:39,110
companies and damage their own economies

373
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:42,559
just to get access to those systems okay

374
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,490
so we have in society we have created

375
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,179
today we have the balance between

376
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:49,670
industry government and the users and in

377
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:51,199
general the government has to protect

378
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,969
users against overreach of in

379
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,310
and we have all the democratic means to

380
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,170
protect against overreach of government

381
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,029
now in the US people tend to be more

382
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,740
worried about that government I'm in

383
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:03,350
Europe people tend to be on average more

384
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,360
worried about industry now of course

385
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:09,079
technology has changed industry a lot if

386
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,430
you speak to any big computer science

387
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:12,260
events or if you look at what computer

388
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:14,599
science departments are hiring it's big

389
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,130
data people collecting all the data and

390
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,480
many of these data comes from IOT

391
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,029
sensors there will be fifty billion

392
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,120
sensors according to Cisco I'm in 2020

393
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:24,260
on the internet so there is lots of data

394
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,870
from lots of sensors which are

395
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,730
everywhere in our cars in our rooms in

396
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:31,130
our devices in our bodies probably and

397
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:34,010
then of course we will analyze these

398
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,240
things then of course we also have the

399
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,100
business model of Industry which is

400
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,449
advertising we never pay Google or you

401
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,300
never pay Facebook or all the other

402
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:42,889
companies because they sell your data to

403
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,069
a whole series of companies a complex

404
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:47,149
ecosystem is not nothing but a big

405
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,470
player all the smaller players there's

406
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:50,720
many small players who actually trade

407
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,310
your data in exchange for showing you

408
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,649
the best advertising and they actually

409
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,510
get advertising revenue from this so I

410
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:58,279
think industry is now for financial

411
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,769
reasons and to give you nice services

412
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:03,949
they're actually overreaching and so we

413
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:06,199
heard a few years ago that data is the

414
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:08,479
new oil and what I heard a couple of

415
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:12,740
weeks ago was and data mining will give

416
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,019
us rocket fuel now we also had from all

417
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,519
we had pollution and I think if you deal

418
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:21,170
with rocket fuel we should be regulated

419
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:22,519
because these things may blow up so in

420
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,839
general what we need I think is a strong

421
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,860
and controlled by government but what we

422
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,540
have seen is through the prism program

423
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,490
the government actually gets access to

424
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,649
all this data and loses its interest to

425
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:33,260
regulate this because they also have the

426
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:35,180
data and so in some sense the balance of

427
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,100
power which had being created carefully

428
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,199
over the last hundred years in Western

429
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,069
societies between all the players has

430
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:45,050
been completely distorted by technology

431
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:46,339
in fact this is not so new this concept

432
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,620
of complete surveillance there was

433
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:51,170
jeremy bentham who actually designed

434
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,699
prisons in the late 18th century called

435
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,170
the panopticon where you could watch all

436
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:56,079
prisoners all the time in fact such a

437
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:59,449
prison was built in London and

438
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,819
fortunately destroyed but actually he

439
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:04,189
describes an environment where people be

440
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:05,120
completely surveilled and of course we

441
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,770
know surveillance can give

442
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,720
rise to discrimination because you know

443
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:12,470
much more about people it makes people

444
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,790
scared it leads to conformism if we know

445
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,100
we always surveilled we'll start

446
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,500
behaving differently and if you look at

447
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,850
progress in history that very often has

448
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,490
come from people who behave differently

449
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,950
and have original ideas and of course

450
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:27,230
it's also a very powerful tool if you

451
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,160
want to oppress or abuse people and if

452
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,930
you understand power

453
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,459
so the question we face is can we

454
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,959
control this power should be first build

455
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,970
such a thing I think the reality is

456
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,710
today it has been built and the second

457
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,870
thing is can we actually defend against

458
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:42,470
this or can we at least try to control

459
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,690
it more so the main messages are there

460
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,190
is an economy of scale issue so you

461
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,960
should not be worried that austere I can

462
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,210
do this they will do it at a smaller

463
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,070
scale these countries but it's only a

464
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,410
few nations have the resources and means

465
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,330
and the access to data to do this so all

466
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,219
the smaller nations will actually bind

467
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,320
together with the bigger nations to get

468
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,080
access and this happens as I mentioned I

469
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,030
believe under secret treaties don't

470
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,660
believe the story that this surveillance

471
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,559
infrastructure is passive its hacking

472
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,079
everything and everybody that's what

473
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:15,199
it's about this means if you're on the

474
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,550
way between surveillance people in the

475
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,010
target they will hack you

476
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,629
there was a technician in Belgium who

477
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,420
happened between GCHQ and a certain

478
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,439
Network his device was hacked the guy

479
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,920
had done nothing wrong he was not a

480
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,589
terrorist

481
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,800
it was just on the path between a and B

482
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:33,980
was enough to control his device I think

483
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,960
if you worry about Kahn sack like what

484
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,610
the quantum crypto are doing you

485
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,800
probably missed it the problem is not

486
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,360
the communication the real problem is in

487
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,070
the end systems how it can we control

488
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,350
those and I think this is the question

489
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,059
for our community how will we help make

490
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,230
computer systems more secure rather than

491
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,490
the old problem you've already worked on

492
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,550
which is how will we secure

493
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,720
communications and of course we're going

494
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,090
to build a society where there were

495
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,590
robots and sensors everywhere and then

496
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,209
we have our governments rabbit and

497
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,370
helping us to security actually hacking

498
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,500
it and keeping behind the

499
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,320
vulnerabilities for their own interests

500
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,970
and maybe a final comment is that it's

501
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,990
very interesting that in European

502
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:13,460
legislation human rights are universal

503
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,230
well of course if the highest court says

504
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,300
that they are violated then our

505
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,780
positions are struck but in the u.s.

506
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,460
situation is even different in the you

507
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,129
there is a firm belief that human rights

508
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,870
stop at the US border if you're not the

509
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,120
US citizen of you know not on US soil

510
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,669
you have no human rights and in fact

511
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,489
it's complete legitimate to surveil you

512
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:33,810
even if scholars believe and if your

513
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,550
agenda believe that mass surveillance is

514
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:40,860
not acceptable and actually goes against

515
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:43,379
human rights so now about crypto so a

516
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:46,709
few months in the stone revelations 7

517
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,300
2013 the New York Times announced or

518
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,640
described the bull run program in which

519
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,100
all the whole bag of tricks which is

520
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,270
being used to go against crypto and I

521
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,850
think then cryptography started really

522
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:59,280
paying attention to what Snowden had to

523
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:02,100
say so of course the people do use

524
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,660
cryptography the easiest way to get

525
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,750
access is just come in and ask for the

526
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,130
key and there is some I would say

527
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,930
circumstantial evidence that in fact it

528
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,730
has happened if you have large players

529
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:14,160
with an SSL private key to decrypt all

530
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,480
the session keys it's kind of likely and

531
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,130
natural that the NSA would go and ask

532
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,690
for that key and from then on they can

533
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:22,500
read all communications and decrypt them

534
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:24,270
as fast as Google can do it because of

535
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,800
security mechanism it's very hard to get

536
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,180
direct evidence because if people show

537
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,180
dilapidate go to jail and most people

538
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,830
don't like to go to jail so there is

539
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,810
cases like lavabit which was the email

540
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,429
provider of snowden who had a kind of

541
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,899
centralized architecture and he shut

542
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,060
down his operation rather than actually

543
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,190
giving up the key there is some other

544
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,470
cases and as i said there is no hard

545
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,660
evidence but if people offering a

546
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,670
service suddenly stopped it if the

547
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,080
service was successful you can suspect

548
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,070
that something may have happened of

549
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,389
course if you're a billion-dollar

550
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,000
corporation you guys are lucky you're

551
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,920
not gonna shut down overnight right but

552
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,060
smaller companies tend to shut down or

553
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,810
give up support for part of their

554
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:03,360
products of course you can try to find a

555
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,830
private key somehow and on Monday you

556
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,600
heard a beautiful lecture on some

557
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,370
attacks on TLS and log jam is one of the

558
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,889
attacks that actually shows that the old

559
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:13,560
legacy export crypto from 512 bit from

560
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:17,730
the late 90s can even today be used to

561
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:19,139
break new TLS connections today and if

562
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,120
you read the paper carefully you also

563
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,800
see they make an estimate on 1024 bit

564
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,600
keys and so you see that actually a

565
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,790
still a large number of servers today on

566
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,310
the internet use 1024 bit keys and can

567
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:32,580
probably broken quite quickly by the NSA

568
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:34,600
using this kind of mechanisms

569
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,220
also the fact that you see su as a

570
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,750
program called flying pig in which they

571
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,180
collect all kind of information on as a

572
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,830
cell service and TLS servers shows you

573
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,660
that this is really I mean not in a very

574
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,730
good shape there this is being exploited

575
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,860
massively it's the best of it protocol

576
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:51,370
but in fact in practice is probably the

577
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,659
most exploited protocol as well if you

578
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,250
can't get the private key why not

579
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,480
replace the public key because in the

580
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,850
end probably cryptography is about

581
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,080
authenticity of public keys and for this

582
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:04,990
we built of course an infrastructure

583
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,879
1012 million servers and we built the CI

584
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:09,040
infrastructure which actually I think is

585
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,290
not a big success well many people make

586
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:15,190
a lot of money with it but every device

587
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:16,690
trusts about 600 of those keys and it's

588
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,550
claim to be only 60 companies I don't

589
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,600
know many make a difference but of

590
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,700
course they have been several incidents

591
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,990
reported and one of the things what was

592
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,850
very good is the work the efforts by

593
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,100
Google to actually spot this better and

594
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,649
use Chrome to actually detect these kind

595
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,750
of things but we have companies being

596
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,760
hacked governments being spoofing things

597
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,980
there is companies selling new products

598
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,990
how to impersonate or add additional

599
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,090
root keys in your company so you can spy

600
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,460
on the Facebook or Gmail usage of your

601
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,379
employees this is actually summarized

602
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,670
products so I think given the many

603
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,550
attacks I don't think we're in very good

604
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:50,710
shape here there is some research and if

605
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:52,240
some good results how to fix this but

606
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,950
it's not happen in this community and

607
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,360
there is also a very big problem to get

608
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,270
those things deployed because you go

609
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,620
after vested economic interests may be

610
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,270
introduced of you of course there is a

611
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,000
very nice work done by Mark Stevens on

612
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:07,629
flame flame is malware that used a new

613
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,330
md5 attack to actually falsify

614
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:13,120
certificates and get access attack a

615
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:15,010
Microsoft update mechanism there is also

616
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,659
some bright light on the horizon at

617
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,370
least there is grassroot attempt let's

618
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,590
encrypt to actually get rid of all these

619
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:24,370
companies and have an open initiative to

620
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:25,629
actually certify public keys so let's

621
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,219
hope that we can do something better but

622
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,600
there is definitely need for more

623
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,180
research it happened that this research

624
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,060
is actually more published in CCS than

625
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,450
actually in your crypto crypto already

626
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,760
equipped

627
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,680
of course another way to get what the

628
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,690
key is to make sure that actually the

629
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,000
key comes out of a managed right away

630
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,549
the trapdoor this is the ultimate dream

631
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,499
because if you can trapdoor this Mac and

632
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:49,658
and that goes from C to a key somehow

633
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:52,299
then by looking at some public data like

634
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:55,179
nonces which you sent always in TLS or

635
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:56,200
IPSec nonsense a random data coming out

636
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:57,789
of the same machine if you have a

637
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,379
trapdoor you can then actually compute

638
00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:02,350
the key which will come out of the

639
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:03,369
random number generator so it's almost

640
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,998
too good to be true but it actually

641
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:09,070
happened as we know so Julie C was one

642
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:12,460
of the four algorithm standardized by

643
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:13,658
ANSI and I saw they were proposed by it

644
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,539
was probably NSA together with some

645
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:18,190
other algorithms it went first to ANSI

646
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:20,200
in ISO was then Samuel ID by NIST and

647
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,109
then people stopped it for noting it

648
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,029
they found many mistakes or deviations

649
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:26,918
before the publication I'm like the

650
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:29,200
paper by Barry and my Christian

651
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,210
Goldstein but then of course in 2007

652
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,980
after publication then Schumer gave his

653
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,559
famous talk at the Crick possession

654
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,429
recouped their obsession and he actually

655
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,710
showed you a piece generator was

656
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:41,230
backdoors and what happened nothing

657
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:43,269
in fact nice didn't do anything and

658
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,129
people kind of shrugged also our

659
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:46,419
community shrugged but I think we all

660
00:23:45,129 --> 00:23:50,259
thought that NIST would actually fix

661
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:52,029
this but miss didn't also I was not so

662
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:54,159
worried because there were four

663
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:56,879
algorithms and usually see was hammer

664
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,739
time slower than all the rest so which

665
00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:01,119
person would actually take something

666
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:03,159
based on elliptic curve because how many

667
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,259
times slower habit to implement and use

668
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:08,289
it well then we found out in November

669
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:12,879
2013 that actually some people were

670
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:15,999
using but so to make sure that you don't

671
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:18,309
use an on backdoored parameter the

672
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:21,220
standard says in the appendix security

673
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:23,859
of you lecie requires at the points P

674
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,359
and Q we properly generated to avoid

675
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:27,009
potentially weak points the point

676
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,749
specified in Appendix A one should be

677
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:30,489
used I don't know what you like irony

678
00:24:28,749 --> 00:24:33,879
but I do actually and I think it's

679
00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:35,109
really funny so of course then when the

680
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:36,340
New York Times revealed this program

681
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:37,720
people start looking back and thinking

682
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,730
about the crypto ramp session I think

683
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,109
Italy quickly this responded by

684
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:44,679
withdrawing the standard there was a new

685
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:46,389
draft out thinking in the past weeks but

686
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:49,509
then it was leaked that actually the be

687
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:51,369
safe library made you only see the

688
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:54,609
default algorithm and this was leaked by

689
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:57,158
Reuters and then last Christmas we got a

690
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:59,080
nice Christmas present Juniper actually

691
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:00,820
announced problems with you only see

692
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,860
we knew they were using the only submit

693
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,409
they claimed there were no problems but

694
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,199
time it was actually shown that my sub

695
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:10,000
careful analysis that by several

696
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,530
carefully crafted bugs that you only see

697
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,150
output would anyway be used and

698
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,730
exploitable and the whole protocol was

699
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:19,000
changed to make the exploit work but

700
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:21,880
then even more finally in 2012 somebody

701
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,100
changed the P and Q the backdoors so the

702
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,850
people who wrote is pay paper on keys

703
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,230
under doormats

704
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,969
they predict the back doors would be

705
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,760
overtaken well this actually has

706
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,260
happened in real life which of course we

707
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,940
don't know who did this was it somebody

708
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,800
else in the NSA or was it FBI doing to

709
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,800
the NSA or the CIA doing it or was it

710
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,750
the foreign nation we still don't know

711
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:43,360
so I can recommend to read those papers

712
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,100
it was great research about this how to

713
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,649
exploit this thing and also how this

714
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:50,909
Juniper thing happened is fascinating

715
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:53,620
history so all of this was actually

716
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,360
thought of by multi human Adam Young who

717
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,250
actually published in the late 90s quite

718
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,429
a set of papers very interesting papers

719
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:02,650
called clapped ography at crypto showing

720
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:04,540
it actually once you trust somebody to

721
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,490
give you a cryptographic library then

722
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,770
this person can actually damage your

723
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:10,000
security interest seriously so you would

724
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,230
never trust any comparable ABI that

725
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,610
comes from somebody else that was the

726
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,680
main message or it should all that

727
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:16,629
cryptographic libraries they published a

728
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,430
book and apparently some rumors happy

729
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:23,050
that they inspired the NSA to actually

730
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:25,360
go on and do their coop of dual ec okay

731
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:27,490
so the book itself is called not clap

732
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:32,740
tog Rafi but crypto virology but it goes

733
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:34,510
after the same thing so the bottom line

734
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,790
is that even if we have secure

735
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,410
connections with SSL IPSec SSH and so on

736
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:41,379
the NSA can exploit a large number of

737
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:43,480
them in real time we don't know how it

738
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,240
works we know some numbers from five

739
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,670
years ago there were about 20,000 per

740
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,710
hour we know yet if the NSA intercepts

741
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,720
cyberattacks it goes all the ways to

742
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,500
Utah for this long-term storage in case

743
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,690
they can in the future

744
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,160
ever decrypt it but turns out that

745
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,410
actually they also have some connection

746
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,880
to a system called long haul and it

747
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,950
performs computing resources for

748
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,450
speeding resources where they can

749
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,620
actually decrypt some things in real

750
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,210
time and inject the whole thing

751
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,469
immediately into tempura or xkeyscore

752
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,480
deep dive we still don't know how it

753
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,770
works but we have of course some ideas

754
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,679
like that you will is the exportation

755
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,668
could

756
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:18,470
of this so in the bottom line is

757
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:21,200
cryptography has been undermined with

758
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:24,860
weak implementations think also the

759
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,869
heartbleed case another example of

760
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,789
course going after keys which is not

761
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:29,959
something we talk of us can do much

762
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:31,940
about well I'll come back to this

763
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,100
undermining standards which is something

764
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,450
we can do something about and maybe also

765
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,980
crypt analysis although we don't know

766
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,419
too much from the technology division

767
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,499
Snowden had no access to their division

768
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:40,820
unfortunately I would really have loved

769
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:45,429
to have all the internal traumas also

770
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:47,539
leaked but this was not to be of course

771
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:51,919
what else is in interest of the NSA

772
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:53,840
IPSec is 48 documents this is perfect if

773
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,669
IPSec is even harder to implement then

774
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,009
TLS probably there is been more mistakes

775
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:59,570
and more problems and I guess we have

776
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,740
seen much more papers an IPSec this is

777
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,450
maybe a nice research agenda for the

778
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:05,450
next five years to deep find also all

779
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:08,389
the bugs their export controls have

780
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:13,059
still been working have been biting back

781
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:15,168
at us and of course hardware backdoors

782
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:16,820
in some way if you can undermine the

783
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:19,730
hardware if you can go the lowest level

784
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,590
you can always undermine security and of

785
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,119
course if you can't win any more then

786
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,980
you send your friends do the field and

787
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,759
you actually have law enforcement say we

788
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,129
are going dark

789
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:33,590
please stop the encryption because it's

790
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:35,990
actually make it impossible to perform

791
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:37,009
our work so there was a document I don't

792
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:40,249
know where we should believe is but it's

793
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:41,389
an interesting figure that some sources

794
00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:43,429
in the government in US government

795
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:45,320
believe that the Snowden documents have

796
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:47,749
advanced the use of encryption by by

797
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,220
seven years that actually after the

798
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:51,019
relation people started using encryption

799
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,570
some company stopped cleaning up their

800
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:55,399
act and so that actually it has done a

801
00:28:53,570 --> 00:29:00,428
lot to actually get more crypto out

802
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:03,320
there so but let's look at crypto today

803
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:05,450
and when I started in crypto was late

804
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,639
80s I don't think they were more than a

805
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,200
few million crypto boxes out there was

806
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:11,949
some government systems we knew nothing

807
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,330
about and there was a financial sector

808
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,950
and they had some ATMs and probably some

809
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,990
internal crypto but most of the crypto

810
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:21,230
was in hardware and a typical crypto box

811
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:22,490
was about ten thousand euro so it's

812
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,970
there were definitely not billions of

813
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,480
devices out there so today we have

814
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:30,260
actually

815
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:33,470
very big success because today crypto is

816
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:35,360
everywhere in our pockets although most

817
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,010
of the crypto is there to protect the

818
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,659
industry I counted about 18 billion

819
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:41,900
devices and I guess I should do more

820
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:44,900
work on this the biggest deployment is

821
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,940
bank arts and you can argue a bank card

822
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,040
protects the bank against you but to

823
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:51,140
some extent it actually also protects

824
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,030
you against hackers so I don't give it a

825
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:55,490
red score but an orange score somewhere

826
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,840
halfway it's kind of good for the user

827
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,100
but it's been particularly good for the

828
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,889
bank and this Bank art is always

829
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,659
watching what you do then you have

830
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,520
access cards it's really access to

831
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,470
buildings so I don't think the user

832
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,299
himself benefits much it's more for the

833
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,910
organization you have the update of

834
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:11,900
devices there you can also argue is good

835
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:14,299
that your user that your device is

836
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:17,270
updated correctly because people try to

837
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:19,070
undermine this to attack you well of

838
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,510
course it means if you devise update but

839
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:22,939
you're also under control of the entity

840
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,620
that updates you in some sense secure a

841
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,450
bit mechanism is a blessing but it's

842
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:29,059
also a curse it means you're now

843
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,400
controlled by somebody else then I think

844
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:34,990
whether user is really the enemy is

845
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:38,419
content protection pay TV Playstations

846
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:40,370
blu-ray DVD all these settings the user

847
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:43,040
is the enemy and crypto is actually used

848
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:45,080
against the user so it's not benefiting

849
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,250
the user or you can say it does benefit

850
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,409
him because otherwise you couldn't watch

851
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,210
the videos but at least in the security

852
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:52,940
model the user is the enemy and it's not

853
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,500
the Alice or the Bob identity cards

854
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,700
again it's a mixed case and then you

855
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,880
have the readers for access control

856
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,919
devices and Bank terminals so it's kind

857
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,919
of a large deployment but not too much

858
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:07,400
to help the user so what does help the

859
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:09,380
user and Phil's presentation actually

860
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,179
spoke about cryptography for security

861
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,429
kept ography for privacy and

862
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:14,480
cryptography for cryptography so I think

863
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:17,000
that I see have a slightly different

864
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,190
division so I think security and privacy

865
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,720
are actually intertwined and very often

866
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,429
you can't have security without privacy

867
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,080
and vice versa so I'm not sure that's

868
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:26,480
the right division so what I call

869
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,639
security to protect user data and the

870
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,049
biggest deployment is mobile

871
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,360
communication about 6 billion devices

872
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:34,429
that have encryption but the bad news is

873
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,260
it's never end to end at least not if

874
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:38,270
the telco provides it it stops always

875
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,600
somewhere in the network so it goes in

876
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:42,800
clear over the fixed network

877
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,959
then you have the ssl infrastructure

878
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,139
several billion devices client systems

879
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,480
and 10 million 12 million servers I

880
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,130
spoke about it I mean it's of course a

881
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,110
fantastic infrastructure but it's also a

882
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:56,870
fantastic way to exploit it especially

883
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:58,280
the public infrastructure behind it even

884
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:01,550
if we fix the security which we should

885
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:03,440
do we also have to fix the PKI because

886
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:06,409
if you don't do this actually it remains

887
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,450
a massive system exploitation then we

888
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:10,850
have the more interesting cases let's

889
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,500
just - IPSec I don't know the numbers

890
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:14,090
I'm not sure I guess it's more corporate

891
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,940
use it's very hard to get numbers on

892
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:19,250
those another more interesting case is

893
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,470
encrypted hard disks so one in two heart

894
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:23,120
is today is encrypted but most of those

895
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,140
hard disks if you take them out of your

896
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,320
machine and put them in a different

897
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,400
machine they still work because they

898
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,290
don't want to the key management that

899
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,580
you have to pay extra for that so now

900
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,860
you have crypto costing you money

901
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,389
slowing you down consuming power but not

902
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,449
giving you any security because the key

903
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,770
management has not been installed so I

904
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,679
would say it's a mixed case if you want

905
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:44,530
to do it properly you can but if you the

906
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:46,870
average user is not helped by it

907
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:50,559
we have Skype very interesting case

908
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:53,239
Skype was distributed peer-to-peer

909
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,309
European it was not transparent we

910
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,200
couldn't know how it works

911
00:32:54,309 --> 00:33:00,220
Skype was required by Microsoft for

912
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,950
eight and a half billion dollars in 2011

913
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:06,110
within a few months the NSA was able to

914
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,620
decrypt Skype to Skype calls is there a

915
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,469
connection

916
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:12,290
I will not decide it this is for you to

917
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,929
decide about this but I think it's a

918
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,070
problem is still not open either

919
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:17,470
whatsapp actually is based on open

920
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,820
technologies there are 1 billion users

921
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,660
it's based on open whispering systems

922
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,790
but is it secure

923
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:26,240
I guess is something for us to find out

924
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:28,159
but if whatsapp is secure is the first

925
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,660
secure crypto we delivered to users for

926
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,960
more than 1 billion users between the

927
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:35,240
mass market ok I guess it's something we

928
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,240
should be looking at so this is

929
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,530
summarizing the same thing in text and I

930
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,940
guess I can I don't agree with

931
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,110
everything in our article but I think

932
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,100
it's a very interesting article on the

933
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:49,129
same topic so there is people that works

934
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:51,230
actually this is also Snowden documents

935
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:53,700
it says OTR encrypted no decrypt

936
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:58,620
available so OTR is the of the

937
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:59,549
church system so what seems to be okay

938
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,229
is to crypt

939
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:06,059
although development has stopped and

940
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:06,840
there is new forks GPG tor the NSA says

941
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:09,690
store stinks

942
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,040
although we have documents from a couple

943
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,970
of years ago saying that problems with

944
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,290
it I would think that they've been

945
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:15,328
investing heavily in actually the

946
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,829
analyzing tour and so I would not be so

947
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:18,419
confident that actually using tor makes

948
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:22,409
you more secure I mean I hope it does

949
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:24,270
but it should be careful there is at RTP

950
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:25,980
and as we learned on Monday it's

951
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:28,310
actually vulnerable to downgrade

952
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,599
problems so more work is needed there

953
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:33,029
what do this even have in common they

954
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:34,470
use standard crypto which is RSA a devii

955
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:37,530
elm an elliptic curve with large keys

956
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:40,770
the open source they give end-to-end

957
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:43,829
security and there are few users few I

958
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:45,300
mean at most millions in fact if you

959
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:48,089
look at the whole crypto battle we've

960
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:50,040
actually lost big because in 30 years

961
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:52,589
crypto went from a few million devices

962
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,929
to about 30 billion but in fact we

963
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:57,450
managed to get make it impossible for

964
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:59,220
the average user the billion user to

965
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:01,109
actually have secure communication or

966
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:04,529
secure protection of data so I think as

967
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:05,520
a community we failed very big and it's

968
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,079
not always our fault

969
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,700
there is many other forces at play but I

970
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:12,599
think we should be aware of this and we

971
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:17,040
should think this is our problem too so

972
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,980
what about crypto research as you heard

973
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,089
on Monday there is still surprisingly a

974
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,770
lot of work to be done on secure

975
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:24,540
channels it's kind of the old problem

976
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,069
the problem I mentioned is not the most

977
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:29,310
important one although I think it's very

978
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:30,839
important still it's actually amazing

979
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,890
that we still are working on this and in

980
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:33,270
the last 10 years I think we've

981
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,920
discovered much more but secure channels

982
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:37,500
than we have in the history of

983
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,560
cryptography so but there is still a lot

984
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,359
to be done and for example on monday you

985
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,578
heard about downgrade attacks and how to

986
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:45,900
deal with this secure negotiation there

987
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,520
is a seizure competition giving us

988
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:51,030
better performance for authenticated

989
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,160
encryption it is forward secrecy for

990
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,470
example one of the things googled it

991
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,720
after Snowden revelations was switched

992
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,790
from RSA with a private key but can be

993
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,910
asked by a security letter to defi

994
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:06,089
Hellman

995
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:07,500
in the hands of Google and in fact one

996
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:09,870
of my students went to Google

997
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,970
I think must been around 2010 and heard

998
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,690
summer job was actually to speed up

999
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:17,399
elliptic curve cryptography

1000
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:18,960
diffie-hellman and she made it from two

1001
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,300
or three times slower than RSA to only

1002
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,020
30% slower than RSA and Google said this

1003
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,550
is very nice

1004
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,150
do you really think we're gonna slow

1005
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:28,980
down our service by 30% for this scheme

1006
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,540
she was hired anyway by Google but so

1007
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,220
only after Snowden Google decided they

1008
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:35,720
could pay the price for actually going

1009
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:38,609
up to 50 Hellman have forward secrecy

1010
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,169
but if you look at the protocols the NSS

1011
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,850
security but in fact it doesn't work

1012
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,770
that well BGP they're still discussing

1013
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:46,140
the routing security this is still not

1014
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:48,600
done and all the other things we should

1015
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,740
have them secure by default I think if

1016
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,120
you want to go for it you should go to

1017
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:53,939
the ITF and I guess it's going to be a

1018
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,770
long and difficult battle you can do

1019
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,180
other things like Adrienne Parekh in

1020
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:59,460
Zurich is just designing everything from

1021
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,690
scratch again and it's looking at if we

1022
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,890
would build the Internet today giving

1023
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,510
the trap moles we have today how would

1024
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,430
we do this and I recommend you look at

1025
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,900
this work it's really interesting it's

1026
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:09,120
actually not impossible to do it of

1027
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,920
course from a deployment point of view

1028
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,180
it can only be done as an overlay but

1029
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,920
it's not impossible I think that's the

1030
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:19,080
message I want to give metadata is a

1031
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,910
very big problem and I think this

1032
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:24,029
community has kind of abandoned this and

1033
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,200
left it over to the past community it's

1034
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,610
actually a much harder problem than

1035
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,399
encryption because with metadata

1036
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:31,620
protection you never get nice proofs you

1037
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,750
need to have models about communication

1038
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,460
systems about communication statistics

1039
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,980
and so on so it's very difficult

1040
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,570
research I think tor is a good thing but

1041
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,890
we need many more systems many more

1042
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,600
approaches to this and I think we should

1043
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:45,029
look at the problem more any particular

1044
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,319
location privacy this is there is how

1045
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:49,200
much of papers but there is zero

1046
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,520
deployment or there is very little in to

1047
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,740
estimate but also very little solution

1048
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:57,240
that actually have been tried and work I

1049
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:00,419
think one thing we should have learned

1050
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:04,140
we teach our students that category is

1051
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,460
used to move sequence to Keith but we

1052
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,650
don't teach our students that if you put

1053
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,050
all secrets into one key then somebody

1054
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:12,750
will come and get this key and so we

1055
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:14,310
should actually think about this and I

1056
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,320
think even this met was one the first to

1057
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:18,029
look at some of these problems at group

1058
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,190
Aoyama cryptography about sharing keys

1059
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,970
and we had research from the 90s about

1060
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,200
this

1061
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,299
but as far as I know it's only been

1062
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,700
deployed by some CAS for the top level

1063
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,490
for DNS but like threshold cryptography

1064
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:32,160
is not deployed I can even tell you a

1065
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,720
secret for the Helios elections with ICR

1066
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,009
we don't use special cryptography so

1067
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,990
there is three trustees and if one of

1068
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,880
them lose their key then we have to do

1069
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,939
the election again because threshold

1070
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,020
cryptography is too hard to implement I

1071
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:45,180
think there we actually can do something

1072
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,369
because it's not so hard to implement we

1073
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,500
can do it it's just a matter of go for

1074
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:51,810
it I think we have technologies from the

1075
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,310
80s and 90s where we can protect against

1076
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:56,340
those things but we should also make

1077
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:58,290
sure that those things get used the

1078
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:01,830
Hydra problem is computer security of

1079
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:03,180
course and I think if crypto is in bad

1080
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:06,240
state public a bit of security is in

1081
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:09,990
even worse State we have a lot of legacy

1082
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,339
we have more and more zero days serious

1083
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:14,189
problem being discovered think of

1084
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,380
heartbleed or shell shock and of course

1085
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:18,720
what's not being reported so much is

1086
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,700
that the US government had access to

1087
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,930
heartbeat probably before all of us so

1088
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,819
they first could use it for a while to

1089
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:27,270
exploit and then before it was actually

1090
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:30,359
released our devices need continuous

1091
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:33,509
update which means that and in fact

1092
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:35,880
updates are can be dependent on your IP

1093
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:38,670
address your MAC address your country on

1094
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,440
other things so the entity that updates

1095
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:44,400
your device also controls your security

1096
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,810
and privacy completely we don't have

1097
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,760
very good defense technologies I think

1098
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:49,650
the industry now has given up more or

1099
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,880
less and they say we're gonna go for

1100
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,560
security by Big Data we'll watch

1101
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,660
everything and everyone all the time and

1102
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,670
those who behave badly we will find them

1103
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:58,410
I'm very skeptical I mean the watching

1104
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:00,599
will work and they will find the guys

1105
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,980
who behave badly I'm very skeptical but

1106
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,089
some people who make lots of money with

1107
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:07,260
this we don't think about human factors

1108
00:40:05,089 --> 00:40:09,390
supply chain this is the famous picture

1109
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,099
where NSA employees are adding chips to

1110
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:13,319
a Cisco routers so and I know companies

1111
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:15,240
who go pick their devices in person at

1112
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,030
the supplier to avoid these kind of

1113
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,229
attacks so it's in pretty bad state I

1114
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:21,960
guess the only thing we can do quite

1115
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,700
well is detecting data at West so we

1116
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,040
have encryption depending on who you

1117
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:29,220
trust you may deploy BitLocker or to

1118
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:31,050
crypt in the cloud in principle we can

1119
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,250
do it but it's not done and the big

1120
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,330
problem of course is the key management

1121
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:38,490
we don't work enough on this

1122
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:42,640
but if you want to compute on data so

1123
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:45,629
let's take a step back and I think the

1124
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:49,120
real issue is architecture is politics

1125
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:51,220
the way our IT infrastructure has

1126
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,509
evolved of course it has evolved

1127
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,430
gradually it has evolved because of

1128
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:58,950
several reasons but in the end the way

1129
00:40:54,430 --> 00:41:01,480
it's being done is to create control and

1130
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:03,040
can be controlled by governments or can

1131
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,190
be financial control or control of

1132
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,650
monopolies or de facto oligopolies but

1133
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:11,410
we should not think as technologists or

1134
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:13,210
scientists at the internet and the cloud

1135
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:14,589
and these things happen just by

1136
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:16,540
coincidence so because it's the best

1137
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,010
thing there is some steering behind this

1138
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,660
and I mean the fact for example that

1139
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:22,480
Skype was required is a good example of

1140
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:26,410
this Skype was distributed but Skype had

1141
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,880
to be taken under control so it has

1142
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,770
privacy implications also security

1143
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,410
implications the other thing is I think

1144
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:34,960
we should stop collecting big data which

1145
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:36,730
is actually as a community advocate is

1146
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,770
we should stop doing this because big

1147
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:41,590
data yields big bridges think of

1148
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:44,380
pollution people still don't think about

1149
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:45,670
the consequences but there is so many

1150
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,200
witches today that we cannot guarantee

1151
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,390
even large companies that they that they

1152
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,859
will not be breached and which is

1153
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,960
another security problem there also a

1154
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,520
privacy problem also security problem

1155
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,710
think of the Office of Personnel

1156
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,570
Management everybody in the US in

1157
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:00,640
security clearance the data was breached

1158
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:03,460
this is a major security problem for the

1159
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,020
u.s. so we should really be very careful

1160
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,330
about this we collect massive data in

1161
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:10,090
the hope to make rocket fuel and get

1162
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:11,710
some short-term benefits in the long

1163
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:13,090
term we may destroy our ecosystem it's

1164
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:16,660
very similar to what we've been doing

1165
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:20,520
with global warming and oil and co2 we

1166
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:22,540
should be very careful about this so

1167
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,450
interesting I don't wanna spend too much

1168
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:29,080
on the legal side but I think we have to

1169
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:30,490
talk to politicians or warriors too it's

1170
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,720
not only a technology problem I think

1171
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:35,589
it's very naive to believe we can also

1172
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:38,020
with the technology so last October

1173
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,910
European Court of Justice I'm actually

1174
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,290
fittingly I can give this talk here

1175
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,790
because max schrems is a student in

1176
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:44,230
Vienna very smart student I recommend

1177
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,060
you look at this lecture for example ECG

1178
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:48,490
see like she was brilliant he actually

1179
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:50,890
brought down

1180
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:52,419
safe harbor agreement like complaining

1181
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,190
the Irish Privacy Commissioner about

1182
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:56,560
prison and saying my data my personal

1183
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:58,480
data is actually being abused by the NSA

1184
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,279
and if you do something about this and

1185
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,520
so the highest European Court actually

1186
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,030
said it's correct safe harbor has to be

1187
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,470
stopped

1188
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:06,940
of course the politicians are now

1189
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:08,379
working on privacy shield and I'm not

1190
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:11,560
sure a privacy shield will be better but

1191
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:14,950
at least there was a small victory but I

1192
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:17,650
went to a conference with lawyers and

1193
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:20,259
politicians last January and the

1194
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:22,300
European bureaucrats said yes the

1195
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:25,360
highest court has spoken about this but

1196
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:28,119
in the end it's political problem so

1197
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,190
again what the court says doesn't matter

1198
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:31,960
if it goes to the core of our society

1199
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:37,200
the political power then the highest

1200
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:39,640
courts even in Europe are being ignored

1201
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,560
so maybe a bright spot on the horizon is

1202
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,020
that last week the general data

1203
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:46,750
protection regulation got approved and

1204
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:49,390
in fact it will come into force in two

1205
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:50,740
years from now because it's so it makes

1206
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:54,190
a big change that industry gets two

1207
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:55,899
years time to adjust and it would be

1208
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:57,550
topic of a whole lecture but essentially

1209
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,109
it's embodied something like privacy by

1210
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,880
design and lawyers already have kind of

1211
00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:02,470
been bending this thing but I think it's

1212
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,090
a unique opportunity for cryptography to

1213
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,470
get some of that things used because the

1214
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:08,290
privacy by design principle says that if

1215
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:09,939
you do something you achieve certain

1216
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,170
goal if you do it in the most privacy

1217
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,700
friendly way if you not collect more

1218
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:15,700
data than actually it's really needed

1219
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,990
for the service the fines are now

1220
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,850
serious up to four percent of global

1221
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:20,669
turnover and of course there is an

1222
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:24,160
exception for national security

1223
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:26,470
apparently this doesn't seem to be

1224
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,549
relevant so the fact that mass

1225
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,899
surveillance violates human rights

1226
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:31,720
cannot be dealt with by privacy

1227
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,850
legislation what we should do I think is

1228
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,439
keep data local somehow the industry has

1229
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:37,900
convinced us that this device which has

1230
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,210
more power than a crave from the 80s is

1231
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:42,790
not smart enough to tell somebody which

1232
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:44,010
advertisements I want to see and somehow

1233
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:46,450
we all believe this

1234
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:47,950
this device knows a lot about me and it

1235
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,750
could perfectly tell which I've

1236
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:51,490
attachment I want to see without giving

1237
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:56,770
any data about myself except for this

1238
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:59,500
information I think that's a fundamental

1239
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:01,090
point of course you say I went back up

1240
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,289
well we can create local backup

1241
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:04,509
infrastructures in our

1242
00:45:02,289 --> 00:45:05,890
without friends we can use special

1243
00:45:04,509 --> 00:45:07,749
systems for this it's actually possible

1244
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:09,519
to achieve the same functionality maybe

1245
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:11,109
at a slightly higher cost without

1246
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:13,448
putting all this data at risk in a

1247
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:14,828
central place and we will be protected

1248
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:18,009
at the same time against industry and

1249
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:19,929
against governments ok and of course

1250
00:45:18,009 --> 00:45:21,999
there is many cryptographers in front of

1251
00:45:19,929 --> 00:45:23,349
me so you all know this can be done for

1252
00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:26,379
many applications using zero knowledge

1253
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:28,749
oblivious transfer information retrieval

1254
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:29,890
maybe the other stuff is a bit more

1255
00:45:28,749 --> 00:45:32,140
challenging to do it very efficiently

1256
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:34,199
but we should work on this but at least

1257
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,729
we should show what is possible today

1258
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:39,099
it's very difficult to as a cell because

1259
00:45:36,729 --> 00:45:41,859
if you collect everything I mean general

1260
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:43,179
there is more control and so the

1261
00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:44,589
government and industry will prefer to

1262
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:46,359
have more data because they see other

1263
00:45:44,589 --> 00:45:49,150
uses for it and they some applications

1264
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:50,919
work better with central data especially

1265
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:52,029
fraud detection in some cases if

1266
00:45:50,919 --> 00:45:54,098
everything is local fraud detection

1267
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:56,469
becomes a lot harder so we have to think

1268
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:57,939
about this but in general as

1269
00:45:56,469 --> 00:45:59,949
cryptographers we face the problem that

1270
00:45:57,939 --> 00:46:02,769
the broader public does not understand

1271
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:05,109
what a crypto magic can achieve in spite

1272
00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:07,238
of the paper by charge lackeys got there

1273
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:08,469
and we D you and Tom person and others

1274
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:10,179
on how to explain the noise to our

1275
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:12,069
children we still haven't managed to

1276
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:15,369
explain so much to our politicians or to

1277
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:18,099
our lawyers ok I'll skip the example I

1278
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:22,079
wanted to give so of course for small

1279
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:24,729
data we do have sometimes we centralize

1280
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,890
information an example is genomics

1281
00:46:24,729 --> 00:46:29,288
research there is now a trend in medic

1282
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:31,839
medical sciences to characterize

1283
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:33,939
individual cancers and actually develop

1284
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:36,699
treatments based individual cancers it's

1285
00:46:33,939 --> 00:46:38,439
clear that you cannot find which

1286
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:39,849
treatment works best for each cancer if

1287
00:46:38,439 --> 00:46:42,098
everybody insists on keeping their own

1288
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:43,809
data with themselves but you need to

1289
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,609
pull something here because otherwise

1290
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:47,140
you will not be able to find it so this

1291
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:50,199
is clearly a case where big data is

1292
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:52,509
needed we have some technologies which

1293
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:55,089
are imperfect like pseudo names we know

1294
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:57,249
that it kind of sucks but it's something

1295
00:46:55,089 --> 00:46:59,439
we can look at there is differential

1296
00:46:57,249 --> 00:47:02,140
privacy it has its shortcomings but it

1297
00:46:59,439 --> 00:47:05,678
can be used there is work on search and

1298
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:07,419
processing of encrypted data and this is

1299
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:08,890
one way of doing it but of course you

1300
00:47:07,419 --> 00:47:11,890
should be aware that in genomics people

1301
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:13,239
speak about gigabytes of data and it's

1302
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:15,210
not clear already for those kind of

1303
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:18,240
scales

1304
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:19,859
I think also we need to think of

1305
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,509
cryptographic techniques to give better

1306
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:22,920
governance once this data is there we

1307
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,540
should see who access to data who did

1308
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,470
what on the data we should invent

1309
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:30,029
cryptographic mechanisms to actually

1310
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:31,709
protect this data better and to make

1311
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:33,750
sure that if people use certain

1312
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:35,190
operations there somehow logged and that

1313
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:38,250
you can actually find out who did what

1314
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:40,950
at which time ok so I think it's a

1315
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:44,130
fascinating research topic I still think

1316
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:45,689
we should favor local data we should not

1317
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,800
say oh we can encrypt everything put

1318
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:48,359
everything in the cloud because we have

1319
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,060
all this fantastic fulham of concretion

1320
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:52,830
so now go to the cloud I think it's is

1321
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:55,980
actually a very big risk that in our

1322
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:57,450
enthusiasm for fhe we actually forget to

1323
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:59,820
point out the risk of data in the cloud

1324
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:01,589
and we all know that all the data in the

1325
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:04,619
cloud will not be encrypted with fhe in

1326
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:06,210
the next 50 years so we should actually

1327
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:09,060
start our papers with that that would be

1328
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:11,520
really honest to do that because in fact

1329
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,720
that's what if you go to industry cloud

1330
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,339
conference and you raise the privacy

1331
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,509
issue then these guys if they can

1332
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:20,880
pronounce it as a volume of the

1333
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:23,339
encryption so we should not oversell our

1334
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:31,250
solutions but of course we should work

1335
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:33,890
on it ok next point is transparency so

1336
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:38,790
if you think about all these things

1337
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:40,680
about control about backdoors about

1338
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:43,650
updates specifically for people in a

1339
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:49,680
certain country you prefer really open

1340
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:51,089
systems and I think I see of course

1341
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,640
there is big benefits and be a fantastic

1342
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:55,049
system created on the close source but

1343
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:59,279
still I think as a society we should go

1344
00:48:55,050 --> 00:49:02,820
to open systems because I think what we

1345
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,859
want is transparency and security so of

1346
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,750
course open source so far has had quite

1347
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:10,619
a bad governance and heartbleed is an

1348
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:12,660
example of this but in general as

1349
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:14,040
principle what we want is the powerful

1350
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,420
which is the government's and a large

1351
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,009
corporation that should be transparent

1352
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:20,700
in what they do and the small people

1353
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:22,619
should actually be able to have sequence

1354
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,189
I think what we have today is the other

1355
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:25,440
way around

1356
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:26,820
in fact the big companies are completely

1357
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,780
in transparent about what they do with

1358
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:30,190
our data and the government's

1359
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,660
I mean if there was no Snowden we would

1360
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:34,090
even know what tempura is and what it

1361
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:37,060
could do but in fact we as individual

1362
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:38,560
citizens have no privacy and so I don't

1363
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,790
want to start a debate about open source

1364
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,710
licensing and where the closed stores

1365
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:43,120
can be a solution in certain cases they

1366
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:44,350
can also be all that mechanism so I'm

1367
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,759
not saying you always have to give you a

1368
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,020
code but we should think about this more

1369
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,340
and advocate this more and try to

1370
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:52,540
provide solutions so in December as you

1371
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,800
kept the film spoke about economic

1372
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,240
freedom and I really recommend that you

1373
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,850
listen to his talk and read his essay

1374
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:59,529
which he wrote well of course the

1375
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:01,930
academics we are free to choose which

1376
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:04,960
problems we work on but there is some

1377
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:07,180
pressure even academia because you want

1378
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,970
to publish the publisher Paris problem

1379
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:11,620
or you want to make impact so you want

1380
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,910
to work on the topic everybody's working

1381
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:15,040
on because then you'll get more

1382
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:17,770
citations and of course in industry you

1383
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:20,140
have even much much freedom on the other

1384
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:21,970
hand I think it's very hard in

1385
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:24,940
cryptography to predict what will be

1386
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:26,140
valuable and I think even harder to

1387
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:29,800
predict what's going to be valuable to

1388
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:31,330
society on the other hand I think if

1389
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,010
you're honest with yourself you probably

1390
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:34,750
can tell about certain of your results I

1391
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:36,940
know this is actually this is crypto for

1392
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,590
crypto I still calls it but I think in

1393
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,090
general is very hard to make distinction

1394
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:41,830
this way I disagree a bit with film

1395
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:44,050
maybe so for example if you think of

1396
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:48,430
public key public key concept and

1397
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:49,570
Bitcoin or 0.2 fantastic concepts but it

1398
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:51,250
was very hard to receive people would

1399
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:53,020
actually create ransomware with it and

1400
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,970
actually there's a good example of good

1401
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:56,530
crypto being used for bad and I think a

1402
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:59,919
lot of good crypto can be used for bad

1403
00:50:56,530 --> 00:51:00,970
things too but of course and I know

1404
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,440
basic encryption is another example

1405
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:04,390
there is no it's not a surprise that

1406
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,310
GCHQ is a big fan of identi based

1407
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:08,859
encryption because of the backdoor

1408
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:12,340
functionality but maybe for my IOT

1409
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:13,540
devices at home I want IB maybe and

1410
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,550
that's very there I went to backdoor

1411
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,620
because they're my devices so I think

1412
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:20,140
it's very difficult to detect in advance

1413
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:21,580
what is going to be risky or not and I

1414
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:26,799
guess we can also use a code of Einstein

1415
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:28,770
of course if we want to be free in some

1416
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,000
sense there is also the big gap between

1417
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:31,990
theory and practice and some people have

1418
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,430
been arguing it has been growing

1419
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:34,629
although you should be aware that when

1420
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:37,060
RSA was invented it couldn't be

1421
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:38,680
implemented and I think it took about 20

1422
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:41,080
years before there was large-scale

1423
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,399
implementations so of course some people

1424
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,650
say nothing is more practical than a

1425
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,140
good

1426
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:51,260
theory and always say theory is

1427
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:52,670
important at least in theory but so in

1428
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:55,460
crypto we have assumption and primitives

1429
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:57,590
like AES or factoring is hard or your

1430
00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:01,280
favorite learning with errors assumption

1431
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:02,960
we have modes greatest like Jean GCM

1432
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,550
sieve or something like this protocols

1433
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,530
like the authenticate key establishment

1434
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:08,840
in TLS you have the understand much like

1435
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:10,280
TLS or IPSec you have specs which have

1436
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,820
state machines and then you have code

1437
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,770
and so we've been very good in the

1438
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:17,990
research agenda to build up from the

1439
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:19,160
lower layers with proofs to the upper

1440
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:21,919
layers and I will not go into the

1441
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,910
details of mod models although I think

1442
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,390
we should be very careful with our

1443
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:30,379
models and I'm under something struck me

1444
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:31,940
really what's the speaker said that I

1445
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,380
was really happy because we could make

1446
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,450
them even change the protocol so our

1447
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:37,370
proof would be better and if it's a

1448
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:39,350
small tweak I'm also happy for him but I

1449
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:41,020
think your model only covers part of the

1450
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:43,370
system and if you're going to ruin

1451
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:44,900
engineering intuition or common sense to

1452
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:46,730
make your proof work I think this is

1453
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,010
very dangerous because the problem is a

1454
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,660
proof only covers a small view or part

1455
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,950
of the model and in fact you should be

1456
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:56,420
very careful if you start changing

1457
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:57,830
things to make proofs work so something

1458
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:01,100
that stuck with me but when all that god

1459
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:03,740
I gave talk a crypto in the 90s was he

1460
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:06,049
said my father said is possible to build

1461
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:08,540
a cabin without foundations but not a

1462
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:10,640
long-lasting building so we should

1463
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:12,259
actually look more at foundations but if

1464
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,490
you look at what's been doing I mean

1465
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,660
doing here it's not the foundation this

1466
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,279
is actually the next layer we've been

1467
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:18,980
building the walls but have been working

1468
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:23,330
on foundations so which problems are

1469
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:25,040
hard and now I will call Jim masse we

1470
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:27,980
said a hard problem is one nobody work

1471
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,650
self so in fact how many of us work on

1472
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:32,450
hard problems it's very hard to get

1473
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:34,580
publications on and people will say well

1474
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:37,189
you didn't make much progress and if you

1475
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:38,330
actually build on our highly it's much

1476
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:40,370
easier to have success in your next

1477
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:42,200
paper than work on a hard problem we see

1478
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:43,250
some primitives or hard problems of the

1479
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,589
upper layer we saw some very nice

1480
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:48,380
examples on Monday that actually with

1481
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:49,880
automation you can actually stretch what

1482
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:51,350
we do in proof of security you can

1483
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,750
stretch it up to implementation which I

1484
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:55,100
think where we should go and it's nice

1485
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,480
first step that being said I think much

1486
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,880
more needs to be done there because

1487
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,020
makes no sense we have 40 page crypto

1488
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,130
proofs and then someone who doesn't

1489
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,900
understand everything making buggy

1490
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:05,480
implementations I think we have done

1491
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,700
lost so meteorites I think is a very

1492
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,859
good development so the other thing is

1493
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:13,279
crypto lifecycle we focused mostly on

1494
00:54:09,859 --> 00:54:16,250
design and now there is this kleptocracy

1495
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,980
issue this backdooring so can we

1496
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:20,630
actually do clipped ography as multi

1497
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:22,040
hume calls it can we actually clip the

1498
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:24,410
power of people who play with our

1499
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,660
devices I think it's very interesting

1500
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:29,029
how to kill cover channels how to kill

1501
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:31,580
these things but if you look at devices

1502
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:33,650
they have a whole life cycle and in fact

1503
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:36,230
as cryptographers we tend to stick just

1504
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:37,880
to the crypto design and we don't look

1505
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:39,680
enough at all the other phases of the

1506
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,540
life cycle and what can we do there

1507
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,250
which guitar needs to make things more

1508
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:47,000
secure I think there is a lot of things

1509
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:49,690
to be explored so I won't see too much

1510
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,700
about concrete suggestions but try to

1511
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:54,350
understand real problems try to look at

1512
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,430
deployed system stammered AI systems I

1513
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,810
mean the conference organizers we're

1514
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:58,368
giving you tales and all the other thing

1515
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:59,690
if we really interesting to look at all

1516
00:54:58,369 --> 00:55:01,250
this stuff and see whether the crypto in

1517
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:02,660
there makes sense and whether the

1518
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,280
implementation is actually okay and if

1519
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:05,720
you can't do it ask your students they

1520
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:09,500
very often smarter than you so they can

1521
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:11,540
maybe do it for you and also I think we

1522
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:14,300
should try to not only write papers but

1523
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:16,100
also develop solutions so to conclude I

1524
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:17,869
want to say a few things about this case

1525
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,310
I think it's a very good opportunity for

1526
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:21,290
all of you to actually get involved in

1527
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:23,570
the debate and I don't have time to go

1528
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:26,450
into the details but I want to say just

1529
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:28,670
make a few comments first the FBI had

1530
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:32,118
the metadata this was never in the press

1531
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:34,130
but they had it already second zero day

1532
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:35,960
was used and as far as I know this zero

1533
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:37,700
day has not been made public so the

1534
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,650
government is for filing 0 days and

1535
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:42,618
making all of you less secure for their

1536
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:46,550
private interest and the third thing is

1537
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:47,540
that of course it is well possible I

1538
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,740
don't know why this happens that a

1539
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,570
security letter has been sent from the

1540
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,160
NSA to Apple and say everybody outside

1541
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:55,609
the US please put this backdoor in the

1542
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,810
system so in the u.s. you may be ok you

1543
00:55:55,609 --> 00:55:59,180
might be protected by this but if you

1544
00:55:56,810 --> 00:56:01,700
outside the US then this may be

1545
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:03,440
problematic so in general if you join

1546
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,939
the debate and in particular assume it

1547
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,050
would be successful and assume that in

1548
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,030
10 years from now Distinguished Lecture

1549
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:09,310
can stand there and say we really want

1550
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:11,140
there is now hundred million

1551
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:13,060
billion crypto devices let's secure all

1552
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:15,430
the user data then you will have the

1553
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:17,830
question but what about law enforcement

1554
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:20,350
access what about security versus

1555
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:21,670
privacy and I recommend that you read

1556
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:23,740
this paper here which actually says that

1557
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:28,180
is the wrong framing of the debate

1558
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:30,009
so in fact privacy is security property

1559
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:32,680
so if you kind of put them in a balance

1560
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:34,330
this is completely wrong debate and also

1561
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,529
privacy is multi-dimensional it's always

1562
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:37,420
in this debate people speak about

1563
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:40,110
personal privacy but they never speak

1564
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:43,090
about privacy as a public good and

1565
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:46,900
privacy is essential for society to work

1566
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:48,340
as we know it so of course and I also

1567
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,750
would argue that intelligence agencies

1568
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,280
have abused their power have overreached

1569
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,450
and have tilted the balance anyway we

1570
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,700
should actually not work on the other

1571
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:58,000
side on the user side and this may

1572
00:56:54,700 --> 00:57:00,040
sometimes damage what police can do but

1573
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,170
on the other hand it seemed to be also

1574
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,759
kind of a taboo to work on law

1575
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:05,710
enforcement access and I think we should

1576
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,150
actually break this taboo we should not

1577
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:09,100
say it's impossible I think we should

1578
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:11,620
think about it at least write papers how

1579
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:13,299
can we do this better because it's very

1580
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:14,529
nice to I think in first interview

1581
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:18,400
should now secure because I think where

1582
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:19,540
we actually have a backlog but I don't

1583
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,520
think it should be of a bit in question

1584
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:24,640
to think about imagine we had perfect

1585
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,560
channels perfectly secure devices there

1586
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:29,080
is some cases where government may need

1587
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,700
access how would we do this in a in an

1588
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,190
audible way in a controllable way in a

1589
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:36,870
limited way we have actually no answers

1590
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:39,220
either okay so time to stop here so I

1591
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:41,560
think what we learned from Snowden

1592
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:43,089
documents is that the treadmills which

1593
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:45,970
we kind of didn't believe actually our

1594
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:48,490
reality we have very strong opponents we

1595
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:50,790
should think more about system security

1596
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:53,680
network security

1597
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:55,270
it's not about twiddling it's very nice

1598
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,560
to improve our current protocols but

1599
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:59,350
what we really should be doing I think

1600
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:02,529
is rethink architectures and build

1601
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:04,360
disability architectures it's a very

1602
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:07,300
different approach than just trying to

1603
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,830
find you in what we have and also help

1604
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,170
to build technologies I think as a

1605
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:12,370
research community we have

1606
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:13,510
responsibility to do good research but

1607
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:16,060
we also have responsibility to make sure

1608
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:18,040
that some of this actually gets used and

1609
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:19,870
I think we should also engage in a

1610
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,029
public debate if we kept ographers don't

1611
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:23,049
do it at least we understand some of the

1612
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:24,490
issues I think we should

1613
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:28,360
actually engage and help people

1614
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:30,850
understand the issues so I would say

1615
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:33,160
it's all about choices choices you make

1616
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:34,569
and the future of cryptography that's

1617
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,870
you thank you very much for your

1618
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:36,870
attention

1619
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:57,330
so thanks for the stop do any questions

1620
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:04,360
thanks for the talk Bart

1621
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:06,550
you mentioned transparency as one of the

1622
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:08,140
goals and I guess there's a big question

1623
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:10,290
how do you actually deliver a

1624
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:13,029
transparency to people we can't expect

1625
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:15,250
users of various devices and so forth to

1626
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:18,580
actually know the cryptography I

1627
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:20,170
understand the cryptography and I think

1628
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:23,110
transparency also involves understanding

1629
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:24,580
what the threats are and so forth

1630
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:26,650
so can you say something more about

1631
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:30,180
transparency and how we will deliver

1632
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:32,860
that the problem is today we have

1633
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:34,419
favorable transparency I mean even give

1634
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:37,420
an example I mean several examples like

1635
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:39,180
even the Juniper case juniper I didn't

1636
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:41,050
say all these things is but actually

1637
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:42,580
people who spend their Christmas

1638
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:44,770
vacation reverse-engineering all the net

1639
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,970
screen code to find out so if that would

1640
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:47,410
have been transparency which at least

1641
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:48,700
expert would have had a chance to look

1642
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:50,770
at this these problems could have been

1643
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,899
spotted earlier I think the other case

1644
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:54,160
where transparency shows is important is

1645
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,080
the Volkswagen case which is much better

1646
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,580
understood by the broader public but

1647
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,470
actually if you would have transparency

1648
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:01,090
in the software there of course that

1649
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:03,040
doesn't mean that you want every car

1650
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:04,300
owner to hack their own software or to

1651
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,310
read their own software but at least

1652
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,360
society should organize mechanisms that

1653
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:10,150
there is audit and that there is

1654
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:11,560
incentives I think as a government you

1655
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:13,750
can you actually have money so you can

1656
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:16,090
actually spend resources you can either

1657
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:17,350
make office for companies or academic

1658
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:19,240
researchers you can say here is a grant

1659
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:21,430
to please all that certain pieces of

1660
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,720
code I think that's another way to get

1661
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:24,700
transparency so it doesn't have to be

1662
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,259
the user himself understanding that the

1663
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:28,210
released it should be in principle these

1664
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:30,340
things and so in that sense if you have

1665
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:31,540
this mobile it's not necessary that

1666
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,950
actually the code would be revealed to

1667
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:35,320
everybody so you could keep some of the

1668
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:37,149
business models with with code which is

1669
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:40,590
actually not open but you still have

1670
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:40,590
transparency about what is happening

1671
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:50,589
when we think about security against

1672
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:54,069
large organizations such as the NSA we

1673
01:00:50,589 --> 01:00:56,650
tend to stick to the old metrics of how

1674
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:58,329
much time is required and how much

1675
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:01,240
memory is required in order to break a

1676
01:00:58,329 --> 01:01:03,009
particular security mechanism in my

1677
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:08,288
opinion we should think about a

1678
01:01:03,009 --> 01:01:10,420
different criteria the NSA can slow a

1679
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:12,940
lot of computing power at problems and

1680
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:16,210
well it is really limited in my opinion

1681
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:20,140
it is in the number of good cryptanalyst

1682
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:22,599
it is in the number of technicians in

1683
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:24,670
the number of hackers you know talking

1684
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:27,160
about you know several hundred kept

1685
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:30,599
analysts you're talking about several

1686
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:34,240
thousand people who are really top

1687
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:37,799
heckle top level hackers so we've been

1688
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:41,049
working on improving gradually

1689
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:43,180
everything we do if you look at TLS for

1690
01:01:41,049 --> 01:01:44,769
example it's an algorithm it's a

1691
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:46,868
protocol which had been around for a

1692
01:01:44,769 --> 01:01:50,640
very long time and we keep twiddling it

1693
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:54,160
and making sure that the next version

1694
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:56,609
stops a particular attack in my opinion

1695
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:59,618
we would have been much better if we had

1696
01:01:56,609 --> 01:02:01,089
completely replaced our protocols I know

1697
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:03,700
that it's difficult and there are

1698
01:02:01,089 --> 01:02:08,140
limitations every year so instead of

1699
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:13,058
trying to improve things and get rid of

1700
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:17,799
one more bug at a time making agility

1701
01:02:13,059 --> 01:02:19,329
much faster so we might have new

1702
01:02:17,799 --> 01:02:21,069
protocols which have bugs in them

1703
01:02:19,329 --> 01:02:24,640
because we are not going to spend as

1704
01:02:21,069 --> 01:02:29,319
much time on getting rid of all the bugs

1705
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:33,029
but we are going to swamp NSA with its

1706
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:36,730
limited human resources rather than the

1707
01:02:33,029 --> 01:02:38,680
almost unlimited time resources related

1708
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:41,319
to the question of for example the

1709
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:44,078
monoculture that a very large fraction

1710
01:02:41,319 --> 01:02:46,450
of the computers are using windows and

1711
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:49,690
windows is evolving so with a limited

1712
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:51,578
effort NSA can understand how it works

1713
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:54,369
if each company in the world was using

1714
01:02:51,579 --> 01:02:55,490
slightly different kind of algorithms

1715
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:57,680
and

1716
01:02:55,490 --> 01:03:00,379
data structure for its internal

1717
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:02,149
communication life for NSA would have

1718
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:03,860
been much harder even though a certain

1719
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:07,040
percentage of those are going to have

1720
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:09,200
hidden bugs in them so I think that we

1721
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:11,870
are wrong in trying to build a very

1722
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:14,600
small number of protocols which we are

1723
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:16,790
trying to make as secure as possible I

1724
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:19,460
think that instead we should move at a

1725
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:21,800
much faster rate in shaking and changing

1726
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,880
things I think that's a good point and I

1727
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,380
think there is some researchers in

1728
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,300
computer security have looked at

1729
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:28,100
diversity and biological mechanisms I

1730
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,990
think there is one thing that may break

1731
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:32,569
it which is automation if the NSA can

1732
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:33,649
write tools to analyze protocols I think

1733
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:35,120
and the question is move we have tools

1734
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:36,200
to analyze but to design them and they

1735
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,609
have tools to analyze them and them I

1736
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,009
think it becomes a war of software

1737
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:42,350
against software and maybe it's an we

1738
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:43,820
have more equal battle there but I think

1739
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:45,529
this is what's going to happen then it's

1740
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:48,640
going to be automated and then we'll see

1741
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,640
who has the best automation tools

1742
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:06,459
on the subject of automated exploitation

1743
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:09,010
I believe that there's already a DARPA

1744
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:13,030
grant to do research on automated

1745
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:15,040
detection and exploitation of bugs using

1746
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:17,530
machine learning so it's unclear that

1747
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:23,500
just making more systems would have any

1748
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:27,250
impact Thanks okay so thanks Bart and

1749
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:30,720
the program is continuing in 70 minutes

1750
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:30,720
ten forty year and downstairs
