1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:10,330
I added an item to the list of demons

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,639
between which I view myself than

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,570
ourselves are caught since the program

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,549
was printed namely peer review review

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,530
the main power main products in this

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,050
community as the papers we write and

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,660
publish and whatever they embody namely

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,580
theorems and attacks and proofs but we

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,680
don't produce these in a vacuum they're

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,720
shaped in a powerful way by a

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,149
disciplinary culture which is the term

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,579
of use for the values and tastes and

13
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:39,399
opinions that surround us kind of like

14
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:41,379
the air we breathe somewhat and usually

15
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,469
it's questions of culture that I want to

16
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:46,420
consider today two of them in particular

17
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,190
the first is the relations and tensions

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,559
between theory and practice in our

19
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,989
community and my interest and this is

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,178
rooted in my own experience at the

21
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:56,708
junction of theory and practice and the

22
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:58,989
second is the angst of the peer review

23
00:00:56,709 --> 00:01:01,959
process which is hard for anyone these

24
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:03,998
days to avoid it seems manifest that

25
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:06,430
these are important and affect us and

26
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:08,080
shape us in powerful ways some of these

27
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,690
are obvious such as to affect our

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,210
careers and promotions others perhaps

29
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:15,399
less obvious in that the effect our

30
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,800
views of our colleagues even our views

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,490
of ourselves what problems we choose to

32
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,830
work on how we write and so forth and I

33
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,899
believe we can benefit from change and

34
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,179
several of these domains but that

35
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,060
productive change should be preceded by

36
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,400
understanding and this talk if it

37
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,220
represents anything is a personal quest

38
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,590
for such understanding and the view and

39
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,170
the nating there off that disciplines

40
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:44,710
exterior two hours are the ones where we

41
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:47,110
can get the most inside it one may look

42
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,789
askance of the intrusion into our

43
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,330
territory territory of these sort of

44
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,800
alien disciplines but given that the

45
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,670
questions you are fundamentally about

46
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,710
people I think it's in the end natural

47
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,659
two of the works that I've been

48
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,419
particularly influenced by are these and

49
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:06,120
the first is Coons classic work on the

50
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,890
structure of scientific revolutions

51
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,989
reading which to me is kind of scary

52
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,869
it's like reading a kind of Nostradamus

53
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:16,060
prophecy come true and the way he is

54
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,340
able to describe in a book written 50

55
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,870
years ago what's going on in our

56
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,140
in the form of what he calls normal

57
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,540
science and the second is Kahneman into

58
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,119
our skis Nobel prize-winning work on

59
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,620
biases and heuristics which has already

60
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,959
revolutionized many areas of

61
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,120
decision-making and I find it almost

62
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,489
absurd that we can continue to form our

63
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,610
systems of decision-making in peer

64
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:42,849
review without recourse to to their

65
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,349
wisdom things like this theory and

66
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:46,929
practice and peer reviewer things we

67
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:49,810
often discuss among ourselves but our

68
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:57,190
discussions tend to be informal private

69
00:02:49,810 --> 00:03:00,519
and unstructured and Buddha often ends

70
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,470
up is kind of finger pointing and what

71
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,690
this talk is is an attempt to move

72
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,359
beyond that to give us kind of

73
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,129
vocabulary in ideas to make these kinds

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,769
of discussions more structured and

75
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:14,410
eventually move towards greater insight

76
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:16,810
and beyond these particular topics I'd

77
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,629
like to suggest that questions about a

78
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,549
disciplinary culture as much once for

79
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:24,010
research as technical ones within the

80
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:26,760
culture and beyond been important these

81
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,470
are actually intellectually intriguing

82
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,720
with that prelude i come to the first

83
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,310
part of the talk which is on theory with

84
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,920
practice and practice and this is

85
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,750
largely a retrospective on the cultures

86
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,059
in the area and my work with phil raga

87
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,420
way on practice-oriented provable

88
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,519
security like many others my

89
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,130
introduction to cryptography was at MIT

90
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,769
and beyond retrospective I'll dwell a

91
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,870
bit on that culture because its present

92
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:55,120
in so many of us even if implicitly

93
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,910
passed on from generation to generation

94
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,299
and it forms us in ways we don't even

95
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:03,220
explicitly recognized I'd come to MIT to

96
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:05,650
do theoretical computer science I mean

97
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,359
nothing about cryptography but in my

98
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,000
first semester I took a course taught by

99
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:12,489
silvio McCauley which was entitled not

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,950
just cryptography but ironically crypt

101
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,660
analysis I don't recall any presence of

102
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,579
the latter in the sense script Alice in

103
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,260
our community would understand it but

104
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,990
the course was fascinating and

105
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,090
life-changing introducing us to the idea

106
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,760
that security goals could be formalized

107
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,419
and providing these kinds of notions

108
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,490
that we now know all so well

109
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,410
there was a general understanding at the

110
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,840
time that all this was providing

111
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,720
foundations and that these foundations

112
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,849
were sensual for good practice I don't

113
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,830
recall at the time either agreeing with

114
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,750
or disagreeing with this perspective I

115
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,940
was rather just indifferent to it

116
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,270
practice at the time was boring it

117
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,280
wasn't what interested or motivated me

118
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:56,580
what instead drew me like a magnet was

119
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,530
the ability to capture philosophical

120
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,870
ideas and mathematical formalism 'he's

121
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,539
the perspectives in this culture were

122
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,400
fundamentally humanist and the source of

123
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,610
questions was not real life but

124
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,690
imagination and human concerns

125
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,270
interactive proofs here were not about

126
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,670
clients and servers but about people

127
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,120
convincing one another pseudo-random

128
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,800
generators were not about encryption but

129
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,980
about the relation between randomness

130
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,810
and computation the context for

131
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,700
cryptography in this culture wasn't the

132
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,220
rest of computer science rather it was

133
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,830
all that was best and most creative in

134
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,890
the broad intellectual tradition of

135
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:37,710
humanity cryptography rub shoulders with

136
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:40,080
the art and music and literature not

137
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,120
heaven forbid with systems if

138
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,750
architecture was mentioned we went st.

139
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,280
Peter's Cathedral not a processor

140
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,800
discussions were morph between film and

141
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,260
cryptography in a kind of seamless way

142
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,390
we learn not only how security of

143
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,890
encryption should be defined but that

144
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,599
espresso must be drunk at the right

145
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:01,919
temperature and which producers of

146
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,570
amarone to trust this atmosphere

147
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,970
certainly appealed to many people but

148
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,710
particularly to me at MIT I felt

149
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,750
surrounded by people who had been

150
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,580
creating computers and winning Math

151
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,740
Olympiad since there were six years old

152
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,289
and I'd done nothing of the kind until

153
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,750
college my interests had been literature

154
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,480
and history and even then my transition

155
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,920
to science had been driven more by

156
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,260
economic necessity than interest growing

157
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,030
up in a part of the world where a career

158
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,250
in the humanities meant a job as a cab

159
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,770
driver in New York and now I found

160
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:35,400
science literature and history and art

161
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,469
all united in one which was perfect so

162
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,469
cryptographically the culture we are

163
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:43,560
looking at defined itself by these kinds

164
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,310
of themes humanness motivations strong

165
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,250
definitions

166
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:50,070
security proofs by reduction asymptotic

167
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:53,250
analysis and so on as embodied for

168
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:55,140
example now in cold Reich's textbook and

169
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,960
good work was that which reflected these

170
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:00,659
themes work which didn't was relatively

171
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,820
minor and uninteresting a typical

172
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,620
theorem would look like saying that if

173
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,140
one wave functions exist then you can

174
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:11,790
get prove the existence of a way to

175
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:14,630
solve some security problem using the

176
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:18,030
term philosophy for this culture is

177
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,770
somewhat novel ironically the only

178
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,650
president I could find for the use of

179
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:26,250
the term for this types of viewpoints

180
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:28,560
was from well from the adversary crypto

181
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,900
log was an NSA internal newsletter which

182
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,390
was Declassified due to a Freedom of

183
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,039
Information Act request and one of the

184
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,830
articles as an anonymous and essay

185
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,310
writer who gives a synopsis of euro

186
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:44,539
crypt 92 and let me quote of a few of

187
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:47,640
the things they say say for example that

188
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,320
those of you who know my prejudice

189
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,370
against the zero knowledge wing of the

190
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:56,310
philosophic camp etc etc are Don beaver

191
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:58,080
a spellbinding charismatic preacher has

192
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,510
captured from Silvio McCauley the

193
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,190
leadership of the philosophic wing of

194
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:08,510
the East Coast and so on and as comes

195
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:12,810
across here the the view of philosophies

196
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:15,420
perhaps not very positive as kind of the

197
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,980
opposite of practice my own view is kind

198
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:20,160
of different I just nude in the same

199
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:23,580
term as the classical perception of

200
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,220
thought in any case if at the time I

201
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,109
wasn't interested in practical things it

202
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,940
wasn't due to lack of inducement or

203
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,800
opportunity Sylvia was certainly very

204
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,440
interested in the practical and

205
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,750
convinced in retrospect rightly so that

206
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,910
the theory he was developing would be a

207
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,890
value in practice and he would try

208
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:43,380
timing again to convince me and other

209
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,780
students to work on practical projects

210
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,390
but with little success I remember him

211
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,699
saying you know whenever I suggest to do

212
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,230
something practical one of you jumps out

213
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,690
the window and the other out the door

214
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,490
and he was right these things were just

215
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,660
not what we wanted to do

216
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,520
at the time but as often happens with

217
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,770
students we were kind of listening even

218
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,540
if he didn't appear to be and the things

219
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,730
he was saying or planting seeds in my

220
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:12,120
mind and they didn't germinate while at

221
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:16,589
MIT but eventually when I joined IBM

222
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,300
they did philosophy didn't go down so

223
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,940
well on the job market and when

224
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,550
graduation looming the only offers I had

225
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,260
were from Ohio State and Manitoba so I

226
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,870
was quite excited to land an interview

227
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,390
at IBM Research and at that employee I

228
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:33,720
remember someone whose name I didn't

229
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:36,120
then no asking me on what's new with

230
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,279
hash functions and this had me entirely

231
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,930
confused so what what hash functions

232
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,610
what what are they and what could

233
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,729
possibly be knew about them and why is

234
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,070
he asking me and later I learned that

235
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,959
this was Don coppersmith and of course

236
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,649
in retrospect what he was referring to

237
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,869
was the series or md5 seas of work which

238
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:57,779
is going on in fact right under my nose

239
00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:01,020
at MIT and I thought to have been

240
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:03,360
expected to know about it and add us I

241
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,029
like to make kind of parental a to-go

242
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,890
remark that if I'd ever sought a model

243
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:10,050
of successful work in both cheering

244
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,180
practice it would have been hard to find

245
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,250
a better one than Ron Rivest who was

246
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,050
right there to my tea but yet it took my

247
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,690
leaving a mighty for me to actually

248
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,250
recognize this but eventually I did and

249
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,589
I came to appreciate and use hash

250
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,690
functions quite a bit more which I hope

251
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:28,200
has compensated to some extent for the

252
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:30,690
early ignorance in any case going back

253
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,240
to to the story the the response from

254
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,100
IBM was negative I didn't get an offer

255
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,940
there with a lack of knowledge of md5

256
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:41,279
had anything to do with it I do not know

257
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:44,029
but it seemed like IBM was in my stars

258
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,490
at least in the guise of Planets

259
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:49,170
sometimes these research labs feel that

260
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,980
there are some bright idea that they

261
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:55,560
want to push into practice and this at

262
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,680
IBM at that time they had one such which

263
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,869
they called the planet it didn't mean

264
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,489
this it rather meant something like this

265
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,950
and

266
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,750
they wanted to create a network where

267
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,120
they would build security end from the

268
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,790
start which is a good idea but then for

269
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,110
some reason they also thought that a

270
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:17,180
philosophic cryptographer would be a

271
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:20,550
fuse in this and this time I was hired

272
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,979
my good fortune was that Phil raaga we

273
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,859
would also been a student of McCauley's

274
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:29,070
at MIT with me had now joined IBM in a

275
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,630
product group at the Austin lab and both

276
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,410
being in product groups he working

277
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:36,029
exposed to kind of naked unadulterated

278
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:38,550
practice and it came as something as a

279
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:40,620
shock we were confronted with terms and

280
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,479
objects such as these and as

281
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,190
cryptographers are expected to know what

282
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,480
they were but we didn't to us there were

283
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:49,830
more like strange mythical beasts and

284
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,510
this was in spite of the fact that three

285
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,180
of these things are actually from MIT

286
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:58,069
and I think it's a nice exercise for MIT

287
00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:00,870
graduates to ten point which three

288
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:03,870
however over time this changed and these

289
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:06,510
objects became not beast to fear but

290
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,220
more like friends we learn not only to

291
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:11,100
like and use them but more importantly

292
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,779
we learn to respect them and at that

293
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,390
point we were renegades from the MIT

294
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:20,070
culture because to them these objects

295
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:21,959
are kind of noise we saw a gap between

296
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,230
theory and practice and what we did was

297
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:26,839
undertake a program to Brigitte and this

298
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,770
consisted of taking from theory

299
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:31,050
definitions and proofs which were

300
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,329
lacking in practice but from practice

301
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,189
the goals in particular symmetric

302
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:38,160
cryptography largely unaddressed in

303
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:40,350
theory and session key distribution but

304
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,260
also taking assumptions or starting

305
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:45,120
points the fact the assumption that

306
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,089
confusion diffusion primitives like

307
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,920
block ciphers are good and we started

308
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:51,600
what we would do calling what we were

309
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,020
doing practice-oriented provable

310
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,410
security I was not aware at the time of

311
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,990
that this view of Coons quoted here

312
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,149
which paraphrase says that the teams at

313
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,760
which a disciplinary culture identifies

314
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:08,339
itself some of them are essential and

315
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,899
others are almost accidental personal

316
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,300
choices of the creators but in

317
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,560
retrospect I think that is evidenced

318
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,109
here definitions and proofs by reduction

319
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,150
are things that are essential but into

320
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,760
them theoreticians also bundle things

321
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,920
like asymptotics and they use only of

322
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,360
number theoretic starting points but

323
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,400
these are arbitrary and one of the

324
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,900
things that practice or any provable

325
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:34,300
security did is separate them I recall

326
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,970
desert having been mentioned in passing

327
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,740
at MIT in a dismissive sort of way as

328
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,260
some sort of engineering base one-way

329
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,029
function and then solution was quite

330
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,040
clear namely that engineering wasn't

331
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:47,230
science and this was something to stay

332
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,240
away from and not only was the

333
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,490
perspective questionable but actually

334
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,200
the characterization of des isn't even

335
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,110
right does isn't the one-way function

336
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,480
since you can invert given the key what

337
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,520
we did is turn instead to the notions of

338
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,770
pseudo-random functions and permutations

339
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,920
which had been Saul so suggested in the

340
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:08,439
theory community and suggested that des

341
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,240
and block ciphers in general we assumed

342
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,670
to be these kinds of objects and that

343
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,680
this be assumptions under which we could

344
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,589
prove security of higher level

345
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,839
constructs an example we showed that the

346
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:21,970
classic cipher block chaining mode of

347
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,180
operation achieved indistinguishable

348
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,890
under chosen plaintext attack under such

349
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,380
an assumption on the block cipher and

350
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:31,360
this result was quantitative throwing an

351
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,420
upper bound on the success probability

352
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,700
of an encryption attacker as a function

353
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:40,030
of the success probability of a PRP

354
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:42,700
attacker on the block cipher plus other

355
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:45,850
parameters and so numerical estimates

356
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:49,000
have security become possible we started

357
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:51,280
calling these success measures advantage

358
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,740
functions and these types of results

359
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,069
give birth to a kind of subfield of

360
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,620
probably secure cryptography focusing on

361
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,480
the symmetric in which both old and new

362
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,550
modes of operation of block ciphers

363
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,170
could receive proofs based on

364
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:08,709
assumptions about the security of the

365
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:11,829
block cipher in some contrast to the

366
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:14,170
conventional theoretical dismissal of

367
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,880
confusion diffusion preservatives our

368
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,890
sense was that they were not only strong

369
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,170
but they had strength beyond those

370
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,650
captured by standard formal definitions

371
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:25,569
and this led us some inspired by fiat

372
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,490
schmear to produce proposed the random

373
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,070
Oracle model

374
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,709
and the associated paradigm where proofs

375
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,750
are done in this model and then you

376
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:35,939
substitute the random Oracle with the

377
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,010
hash function in an implementation and

378
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,440
we use this in particular to give

379
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:42,959
methods for asymmetric encryption and

380
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,029
signature based on our essay that for

381
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,300
the first time we're able to have some

382
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:50,520
kind of proof and yet become compete in

383
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,849
terms of speed with existing practical

384
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,500
methods we found that significant

385
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,930
practical effort was put into this

386
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,089
problem called session key distribution

387
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:02,250
and it was a primitive that hadn't been

388
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:03,450
considered in theory and so we started

389
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,850
doing that and gave the first

390
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,899
theoretical treatments for both the

391
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:11,310
three party and to party settings

392
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:13,380
message authentication was at that point

393
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,469
just coming into play as a primitive and

394
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:19,170
using hash functions like md5 instead of

395
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:22,500
at that time des for as blazer block

396
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:24,870
cipher was good for speed and at IBM I

397
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,820
was lucky to encounter Hugo craft check

398
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,260
and ryan kennedy and together we

399
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,330
proposed a 'shmock which was

400
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:34,160
subsequently seeing widespread adoption

401
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:36,870
in particular because it's used in TLS

402
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,510
the schemes we provided and lines of

403
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,100
work we introduced have over time come

404
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,230
to have a gratifying amount of

405
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,750
real-world impact through their

406
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:49,110
incorporation into into protocols for

407
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:51,300
example and but beyond that I think the

408
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,370
things we did change the perception that

409
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,380
practitioners have a theory from

410
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,570
something irrelevant to the point now

411
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,060
where standards bodies expect and ask

412
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:02,570
for proofs in any domain where it may

413
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:07,649
seem possible namely for high-level

414
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:10,140
constructs discussion of practicality

415
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:12,470
today feels kind of incomplete defined

416
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,939
ignores the elephant in the room and

417
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,970
namely all the NSA programs that

418
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:20,490
compromise cryptography and obviously

419
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,530
the things we did don't prevent these or

420
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,300
even other real-world threats such as

421
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:27,149
implementation errors and side-channel

422
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:29,639
attacks but Snowden himself I said that

423
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:32,010
encryption is our best hope and I think

424
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,470
practical cryptography is is just one

425
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:38,850
step towards security but one that is

426
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:40,150
important looking back one of the things

427
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,610
that strikes me is how

428
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:44,380
the view of theory from practice is

429
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,719
different from it me what it may seem

430
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,910
for example Terrace think that they're

431
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,290
helping practice when they provide

432
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,780
efficiency improvements to other

433
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:54,820
theorists protocols but in fact there's

434
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,010
in that process they are seldom doing

435
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,780
anything of real utility and on the

436
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,850
other hand they think of definitions as

437
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,129
all the necessary underpinnings for

438
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:05,530
their own work has not really been what

439
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,450
practitioners would care about but my

440
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,250
sense is the opposite definitions and

441
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:13,270
the viewpoints that go in making them

442
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:16,150
are key of utility in practice and the

443
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:18,040
main transfer that theory can make not

444
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:24,670
just for post but even for finding

445
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:27,040
attacks while this some prior slide

446
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:29,530
reflects a kind of technical dichotomy

447
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,139
it was hard to evade also seeing a

448
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:34,750
cultural one between what I now saundh

449
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:36,610
and the film philosophical culture in

450
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,400
the way it mixed up cryptography with

451
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,229
art and literature there was an apparent

452
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,750
breath but in some sense in the end is

453
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,270
deceptive because the culture has a kind

454
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:49,300
of selective narrowness about what it

455
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:51,550
considers appropriate as usually fun

456
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,770
tries to say something when finds that

457
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:55,810
Shakespeare said it better when he has a

458
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,180
hamlet tell Horatio that there are more

459
00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:00,370
things in heaven and earth Horatio than

460
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,960
in all your philosophy and he was of

461
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,030
course thinking about the ghosts which

462
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,400
what I sure didn't believe in but was

463
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:09,010
now staring at and in the same way there

464
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,500
are things which seem some more

465
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:13,629
invisible in the core part of the

466
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:18,310
philosophic culture and perhaps

467
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:20,200
unfortunately to its detriment and what

468
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:22,330
is difficult I think is that when is one

469
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,490
is surrounded by this culture its

470
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,770
seductive and overpowering and 1 x 2

471
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,750
think it's the one way to live and it

472
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:31,510
kind of takes an explicit effort to

473
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,220
value things a external to it so that I

474
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,970
think the hardest task for an MIT

475
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:40,900
graduate in some senses to unlearn that

476
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:43,060
attitude in my kind of optimistic youth

477
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,920
I'd envisioned that working on

478
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,080
practice-oriented provable security

479
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,240
would make me at home in some kind of

480
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,480
united community of theory and practice

481
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,309
but reality prove different I find that

482
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,110
when I

483
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:57,190
I'm kind of always on the wrong side of

484
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,379
the fence in the company of

485
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,360
theoreticians I grumble about lack of

486
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,160
practicality or exaggerated claims

487
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,899
they're off in the company of

488
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,230
practitioners I grumble about a lack of

489
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,910
proofs or appreciation for theory but

490
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,799
over kind of time I've come to think

491
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,049
it's not just me there's some sort of

492
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:16,299
real sense in which all of us as a

493
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:19,420
community are caught between theory and

494
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:22,750
practice and this manifests itself in

495
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:25,120
many ways including sensitivity to

496
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,490
critiques contention and different

497
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,168
claims thus for example most theory

498
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,140
papers claim to have practical

499
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:33,760
motivations and applications but people

500
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,340
who are knowledgeable about practice

501
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,700
tell us that is rare for these papers to

502
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:41,139
actually offer anything of utility

503
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,200
theoretician spent significant effort on

504
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,090
efficiency improvements to their schemes

505
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,700
based on the apparently genuine feeling

506
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,290
that this aids practice but for the most

507
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,480
part practitioners feel that the

508
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,668
improving efficiency for things nobody

509
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,010
wants to use and meanwhile there are

510
00:20:54,669 --> 00:21:00,010
real practical problems out there which

511
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,080
aren't even being addressed and I've

512
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,260
kind of grown interested in this partly

513
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,149
because of my history as a sociological

514
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:09,129
phenomenon and thought would be

515
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:11,260
interesting to speculate about why these

516
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,179
things happen and the first thing that

517
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,730
occurs to me is that perhaps this aerial

518
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:17,830
acts definitional foundations in the

519
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,020
sense that the discovers things in

520
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,549
claims that we are seeing arise from

521
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,799
different people meaning different

522
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:26,320
things when they use the word practical

523
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:28,690
and after Korea spent on definitions I

524
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,030
don't feel I can evade the challenge of

525
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:34,840
how to define practical so I'm going to

526
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:36,820
give it a try so theoreticians identify

527
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,850
practicality with efficiency and i'll

528
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:42,399
call the corresponding notion eff eff

529
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,949
it's not a very good notion I think for

530
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,840
one thing because of the vast ranges of

531
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,419
possible granularity from measuring

532
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,370
group operations to simply being allowed

533
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:54,429
to call something efficient if it

534
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,409
doesn't use a general music another

535
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:58,240
sense emerging nowadays is that to call

536
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:00,240
something practical you need to have

537
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,070
implemented it and written code for it

538
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,260
but the most meaningful notion and the

539
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,550
one I think most practitioners mean is

540
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,890
utility some

541
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:11,530
is practical if people actually use it

542
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:13,780
if it makes our lives better and more

543
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,690
secure in some tangible way if it

544
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:18,670
benefits society then does the

545
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,890
capitalistic perspective which would say

546
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:23,860
that something is practical if someone

547
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:26,080
is willing to pay money for it here it

548
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:28,419
has to be a profit-making entity and NSF

549
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,600
grant or funding by own company don't

550
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,700
count I think as cryptographers we ought

551
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,740
to target the strongest notions as we

552
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:40,030
usually do but it is a matter of taste

553
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:42,190
and choice and to each their own many of

554
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:44,560
the phenomena we now see can be cast are

555
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,210
considered as questions of relations

556
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,520
between these notions there are obvious

557
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,840
implications for example if something is

558
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,060
efficient or not to be able to write

559
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,649
code for it or if someone is paying for

560
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,139
something than someone else ought to

561
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,180
find it useful similarly there are some

562
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:01,240
obvious non implications for example

563
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:03,100
utility doesn't apply profit and fhe

564
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:07,780
shows you that implementation doesn't

565
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:09,669
imply efficiency but but the I think the

566
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,560
really interesting and important fact is

567
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:14,140
that neither efficiency nor

568
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,840
implementation imply utility and that's

569
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,280
embodied by this separation here and the

570
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,709
fact is that you can make your primitive

571
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,360
as fast as you say in both but it

572
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,510
doesn't help if nobody wants the thing

573
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,969
and unfortunately separating examples

574
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,800
embodying this are quite common indeed

575
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,560
it feels like significant intellectual

576
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,510
capital in our community is expended on

577
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:38,620
efficiency improvements for things that

578
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:40,720
no one uses one thing I would observe is

579
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,060
that f1 does want to achieve utility

580
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,400
it's best done by starting with the real

581
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,159
problem in finding a solution our

582
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,020
bottom-up approach whereas in theory the

583
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,030
approach is often the opposite namely to

584
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,460
start from a primitive and then try to

585
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:56,290
dream up applications and this doesn't

586
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,330
work so well the real the reason is that

587
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:00,730
the real problem if there even was one

588
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:03,550
may not require all features of the

589
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:05,560
primitive so that to be able to call the

590
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:08,379
primitive and application one has to

591
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:11,320
tweak or course the application so that

592
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,180
the features become needed but then this

593
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:17,649
results in something artificial and not

594
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:19,990
necessarily of utility in 1988 I

595
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,720
remember my fellow grad student joke

596
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:24,820
Ian writing a paper snapshot adhere in

597
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,980
which he felt comfortable to give how

598
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,620
cryptographers don't sleep well at night

599
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,990
as motivation for his work he attributed

600
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:34,928
this as a personal communication to

601
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,850
Sylvia McCauley it's interesting that

602
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:39,400
there's no effort here to pander to

603
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,780
practice in those days helping people

604
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,600
sleep was apparently good enough

605
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:45,639
motivation not only for cryptographers

606
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,459
to do work but for stock which accepted

607
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,650
the paper and in the same kind of way in

608
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,440
seminole early works in the theory of

609
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:56,230
cryptography are notable for the absence

610
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,429
of claims of practical applicability the

611
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,670
number of occurrences of the word

612
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:03,760
practical for example in these works is

613
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:05,530
zero ironically these works did have

614
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,450
significant practical impact through

615
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,420
their definitions but there was nothing

616
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,920
like overselling going on but today it's

617
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,540
a little different if you pick up a

618
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,880
crypto your crib paper their

619
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,550
introduction is usually some sort of

620
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,910
application story and particular saying

621
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:25,030
how the paper addresses problems of

622
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:26,710
internet security and yet even while we

623
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,970
see these claims getting stronger it's

624
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,210
not clear that there's an actual

625
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:34,809
increase in utility another perspective

626
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:37,270
on this is that the true or internal

627
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:39,220
motivations for work have stayed the

628
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,070
same historically things like technical

629
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,480
challenge and philosophic interest but

630
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,760
while in the past these things were

631
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,160
stated up front they now seldom are

632
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,620
instead practicalities being used for a

633
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,450
banner under which to sell this and I

634
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,449
think this situation is detrimental to

635
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,550
both theory and practice but to be

636
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,309
cleared the situation I refer to is not

637
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:02,080
the lack of utility but the discrepancy

638
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:04,300
between what is claimed in watches what

639
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,100
is achieved in the same way and this

640
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,379
might be seen as an anti theory

641
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,409
perspective but I don't view it as that

642
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:14,290
at all rather I would Sam what I would

643
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,240
paraphrase it as is that I prefer to see

644
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:18,580
theory that's proud to say it was good

645
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,360
theory rather than masquerading as bad

646
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,620
practice why this kind of thing happens

647
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,040
was again to me an interesting

648
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:29,260
sociological question and again I

649
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,200
thought I would speculate and one

650
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,580
obvious region is simply pressures to

651
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,160
get papers accepted

652
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:38,139
Thunder and jobs and so forth and while

653
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,570
this might play a role I think the truth

654
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,250
is more complex in particular and

655
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:45,460
explanation like this seems to imply

656
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:48,220
some sort of deliberate deception which

657
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:51,370
i think is rare instead I think that the

658
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:54,190
claims of practicality are rooted in a

659
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:56,350
genuine belief in that practicality even

660
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:59,350
if that belief isn't supported by an

661
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:02,020
external view and that it arises out of

662
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:04,060
something i call delegated motivation

663
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:07,090
and this is a kind of mechanism by which

664
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:09,490
myths of practicality are created by a

665
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:12,010
kind of echo chamber heiresses as a

666
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:14,350
result of the inbreeding nature of our

667
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:16,690
community so paper is written on some

668
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:19,090
primitive X and then there's follow-up

669
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:21,400
work which will try to improve its

670
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:23,730
efficiency create variants of it and so

671
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,740
on and if you ask what is the motivation

672
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:29,110
those works will say well that's not our

673
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:32,190
concern it was already motivated and

674
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:36,760
accepted as practical by prior work and

675
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:40,540
this creates kind of bodies large and

676
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:42,550
small of works that belief in the

677
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,770
practicality of something but

678
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:48,730
unfortunately some of those beliefs can

679
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:51,490
be ill founded right from the start so

680
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:53,770
we are currently seeing a community

681
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:56,140
sense that claims of practicality as

682
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:59,020
somehow necessary people feel they have

683
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:01,630
to make them and this view is fostered

684
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,879
simply by the culture but then it also

685
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:06,160
gets perpetuated by peer review I

686
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,620
remember once being contacted by an

687
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,960
author which alcohol it for important

688
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:13,389
theoretician who was upset at the paper

689
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,980
being rejected by a reviewer who claimed

690
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:17,380
there was Impractical it had no

691
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,210
practical applications and I've been on

692
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,560
the program committee and hadn't

693
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,660
reviewed the paper but after getting

694
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,730
this complaint I looked it up and what I

695
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,100
found is that the critique came from a

696
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,960
teratogen not a practitioner and there's

697
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,300
a kind of splendid irony here and that

698
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,090
theoreticians reject each other's papers

699
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,710
for lack of applications particularly in

700
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,360
this case where my sense was that

701
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,700
neither the author nor the reviewer

702
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,250
would know what a real application was

703
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,200
if it came up and bit them and plus the

704
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:46,600
reviewer wrote exactly the same kind of

705
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,120
papers themselves and

706
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,340
seems to kind of should be shooting

707
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,389
oneself in the fourth for no particular

708
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:57,909
good region reason and this mention of

709
00:28:55,390 --> 00:29:00,970
peer review is my transition into a

710
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:03,220
quite different part of the second part

711
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:05,650
of the talk whose focuses peer review

712
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:09,990
and I guess the only main thing it has

713
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:12,820
in common is this sociological concerns

714
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,730
and a troublesome domain this is it

715
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,780
wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that

716
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:19,090
decisions of acceptance and rejection

717
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,678
and our papers are our life they're

718
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:23,408
obviously important to personal

719
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:25,960
advancement but more insidiously we let

720
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:28,240
these decisions influence our views of

721
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,220
our colleagues in ourselves we mimic the

722
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,830
writing styles of successful works

723
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,419
people work on what's more likely to get

724
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,850
in just as they work on more and what's

725
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:40,030
more likely to be funded so we obviously

726
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:43,030
want this process to work and I'm

727
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:45,668
suggesting it doesn't and in support of

728
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:48,010
that I'd like to begin our first with

729
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:50,919
some external evidence showing that

730
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:53,500
respected people in domains outside our

731
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,240
think peer review is broken Richard

732
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,760
horton is an editor of a respected

733
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,760
medical journal and let me read you what

734
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,190
he says we portray peer review to the

735
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,960
public as a quasi sacred process that

736
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:07,780
helps to make science a most objective

737
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,900
truth teller but we know that the system

738
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,668
of peer review is biased unjust

739
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:15,220
unaccountable incomplete often insulting

740
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:18,220
usually arrogant occasionally foolish

741
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:23,409
and frequently wrong wow this is not one

742
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:26,440
happy dude and here now is Robert Frost

743
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:29,049
Higgs of the independent Institute and

744
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,270
he says that peer review makes the

745
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:33,850
ability to publish susceptible to

746
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:36,309
control by elites and to personal

747
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:38,350
jealousy if you do not belong to some

748
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:40,178
tight fraternity it becomes extremely

749
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:43,959
difficult to gain a hearing for your

750
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:46,030
work paraphrasing koon someone has said

751
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,309
that reviewers tend to be especially

752
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:50,500
critical of conclusions that contradict

753
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:52,059
their own views and lenient towards

754
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,429
though does match them ideas that

755
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:57,190
harmonize with the established export

756
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:59,260
some are more likely to see print and

757
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,010
all this is just the tip of the iceberg

758
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,240
if you

759
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:03,040
well then just do a little looking

760
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,980
you'll see that peer review is

761
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,409
attracting both analysis I'm criticism

762
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:10,720
from a wide range of sources across a

763
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:14,110
wide range of disciplines and what they

764
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,240
say is pretty damning so let me take a

765
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:19,000
few nuggets from the courts to create a

766
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,100
proposition for us to consider namely

767
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,860
that our conference peer review process

768
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,990
to is subject to issues and critiques

769
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:28,929
such as being in some cases at least

770
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:31,630
unjust insulting arrogant wrong and so

771
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,820
forth and if I were to suggest or ask

772
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:35,830
whether this is us I think one's

773
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:39,610
reaction may follow the sort of five

774
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:42,250
phase model for reactions to and welcome

775
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:44,080
news beginning with denial no maybe

776
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,850
those biologists and physicists and

777
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,000
chemists I like that but not as

778
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:51,580
cryptographers to anger how dare you

779
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,080
even suggest such a thing but what I

780
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,990
would return is that I'm not the one

781
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,699
suggesting it you are collectively when

782
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:01,570
I one looks at how people in our

783
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:03,370
community react to decisions and reviews

784
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:05,710
they get the answers that they act very

785
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:08,739
strongly with emotions that range from

786
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:10,660
anger to depression almost all authors

787
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,730
complain and even program committee

788
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,200
members at this point campaign about

789
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,390
what they see happening on program

790
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,970
committees and the content of these

791
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:21,040
complaints I caused quite closely these

792
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,830
little nuggets that I pulled out of the

793
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,690
courts actually my senses we don't

794
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,120
complain enough for a cure at least in

795
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,800
the right way because although them and

796
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,290
complaints are mostly in private

797
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,440
communications and within small groups

798
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:37,389
and there really ought to be public and

799
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,460
even in the face of outrageous outcomes

800
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:41,770
people have simply learned to shrug it

801
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,900
off because their senses there's nothing

802
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:46,030
you can do about it and it's in poor

803
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,610
taste to complain so we actually

804
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:52,210
publicly see less complaints than then

805
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:54,879
exist and that we ought to see my own

806
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:57,670
interest in peer review is rooted as

807
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,410
many things in graduate school Silvio

808
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:02,080
McCauley used to refer to the program

809
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:04,540
committee as the adversary as many of

810
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,830
you know his seminal papers including

811
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,678
the one introducing zero knowledge

812
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:10,509
proofs were rejected repeatedly and this

813
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:13,840
naturally led him to have a poor view of

814
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:15,879
the process but beyond Sicilian paranoia

815
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,340
i think his viewpoint had more than a

816
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:20,259
grain of truth when we write submissions

817
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:23,110
we try to make sure they would stand

818
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:24,820
attack whereby attack we mean possible

819
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:27,129
critiques that a reviewer may have and

820
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:31,269
that we try to anticipate if something

821
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:33,039
may be deemed trivial we jettison it as

822
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:35,649
another influence a typical conversation

823
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,179
I have at conference may start with

824
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:39,399
someone telling me about their work and

825
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:40,929
I say well that sounds nice so where is

826
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:43,479
it published and the responses it was

827
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:45,460
rejected from Krypto and then it's not

828
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,269
like I see they are that all the other

829
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:50,889
papers in the program are much better

830
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:52,539
many people our community seem to feel

831
00:33:50,889 --> 00:33:56,139
that the process is essentially random

832
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:58,149
that you can model submissions by a

833
00:33:56,139 --> 00:34:01,658
probability of accepting co2 their

834
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:03,549
separate of the conference over time

835
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:05,769
I've kind of made my interest in

836
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:07,990
sympathy for authors of rejected papers

837
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:10,210
known and I feel this has made me a kind

838
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:12,129
of complaint box and I hear a lot of

839
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,559
these complaints and it's things of that

840
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:17,529
nature that have prompted me to think

841
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:19,540
about and talk about this subject and my

842
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:22,030
intent today is largely to seek

843
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:24,460
understanding I want to look at issues

844
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:26,379
and peer review a social phenomenon and

845
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,960
examine them through the lens of

846
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:31,418
disciplines that are external to us but

847
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,799
well suited for the context and that's

848
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:35,649
because although unusual they are

849
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:38,049
natural because these are the tools that

850
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:40,690
deal with things fundamentally about

851
00:34:38,049 --> 00:34:43,179
people and their motivations and can

852
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:45,010
address them and at the highest level I

853
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:47,889
believe that the benefit we get from

854
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:49,389
this perspective is that we start seeing

855
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:52,540
that the source of problems is not

856
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:55,030
individuals but basic human nature and

857
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:57,970
cultural choices and I think if we

858
00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:02,319
understand it that way we open ourselves

859
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:04,209
up more to path to change but before I

860
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:06,640
do anything a few caveats and

861
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:09,040
clarifications are in order first I'm

862
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,770
aware that there are ongoing discussions

863
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,109
and proposals in our community about

864
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:15,910
revisions to our review process but

865
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:18,520
those issues are largely or thumb with

866
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,348
the ones here because my concern is peer

867
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,970
review and that continues to be present

868
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:24,760
in some form in all

869
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,799
other systems second there's no intent

870
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,500
to be sanctimonious I was a program

871
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,240
chair for crypto many years ago I don't

872
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,369
think I did a very good job even if I

873
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,770
also don't know that it was possible to

874
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:37,240
do better or that I was below average

875
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:39,970
had I understood then what I do now I

876
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,830
wouldn't have accepted the job nor am i

877
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:45,040
proud of all the reviews are written

878
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:47,080
over my career third is that if whenever

879
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:52,240
one suggests that they may be something

880
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:54,819
to going wrong with peer review the

881
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,799
reaction people have is to ask for

882
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,570
alternatives and propose and discuss

883
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,849
them but this is kind of putting the

884
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:04,030
cart before the horse I'm going to have

885
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:05,650
no specific proposals for change but

886
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:07,930
rather just an attempt to understand

887
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:12,340
what's going on of course I do hope that

888
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:13,899
some things will change eventually I've

889
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,359
discussed that there is a widespread

890
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,760
presence of contains but this isn't the

891
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:21,009
same thing as an actual community

892
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,650
acknowledgement of a problem and I think

893
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:25,960
we need to start there because unless we

894
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:28,060
wholeheartedly accept that we're going

895
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,220
to have trouble thinking about change

896
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,950
and towards that there at least two

897
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:35,049
obstacles to overcome the first is that

898
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:37,270
most of us were two hats where sometimes

899
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:39,310
authors and sometimes PC members and

900
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:41,530
sometimes we wear the hats on top of one

901
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:44,500
another since PC members are often

902
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:46,750
authors and in the two positions we may

903
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,460
think different things so while in the

904
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,920
position of an author the kind of

905
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:53,859
critiques are made earlier might

906
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,859
resonate with us as PC members we may

907
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:59,140
prefer instead to think that we are

908
00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:02,020
unbiased just fair accountable

909
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:04,750
responsible polite humble wise and

910
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:07,810
correct and we have no elites and we

911
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:10,450
welcome critical views and so forth but

912
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:13,750
it when ought to appreciate that both

913
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:15,879
these things can't be true there's a

914
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:18,400
second more subtle but even more serious

915
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,470
obstacle to acceptance and that's the

916
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,690
kind of view of human nature which says

917
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:25,060
that bad things only happen if bad

918
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:27,130
people are involved and that means that

919
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:29,470
blame and finger-pointing are going to

920
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,839
start or if one has the further

921
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:33,970
optimistic view that me and most of us

922
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,660
are not bad then you simply get a

923
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:39,078
contradiction because nothing

924
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:40,910
critical could should be happening and I

925
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:43,609
think that this cycle is broken by

926
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:45,770
recognizing that the premises flawed so

927
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:48,410
this optimistic view of human nature's

928
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:50,960
at odds with all the findings of modern

929
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:54,288
psychology and sociology and in fact

930
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,299
just with plain history biases are not

931
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:58,280
some sort of vague intangible thing

932
00:37:56,299 --> 00:38:00,829
they're prevalent and real they've been

933
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,599
studied identified and labeled and the

934
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:04,819
work that had the most impact on my

935
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:06,589
understanding was that of Kahneman and

936
00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:09,020
torski which I mentioned before and

937
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:12,170
canimals book is a fascinating and

938
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:14,059
eye-opening read in any dimension this

939
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:17,030
is no snake oil it received a Nobel

940
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:19,369
Prize in 2002 and decision making in

941
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:21,829
many ways has been transformed by this

942
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:24,380
understanding it's actually an amusing

943
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:27,410
exercise to connect some of the listed

944
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,690
biases to phenomenon in the review

945
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,788
process to try to explain them for

946
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:34,250
example a review or after seeing a proof

947
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:36,410
decides that as trivial in retrospect

948
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:39,289
and could be seen as an instance of the

949
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:41,538
hindsight bias the fact that a committee

950
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:43,069
has an internal view in which they

951
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:45,799
collectively think they've done a good

952
00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:47,960
job yet the external view of authors can

953
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:49,670
be very different reflects perhaps the

954
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,920
availability heuristic which says that

955
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,480
the views of PC members are more

956
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,470
influential to others because they're

957
00:38:53,480 --> 00:39:00,099
available in the ones of authors or not

958
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:02,390
indeed at this point I've become so

959
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:04,819
convinced are converted to these types

960
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:06,500
of viewpoints that my sense is that if

961
00:39:04,819 --> 00:39:08,690
you think of yourself as completely

962
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:12,770
objective you're either a saint or an

963
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:14,869
alien so the bottom line is that bad

964
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,700
things happen naturally even when the

965
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:18,680
people involved are good and I think

966
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,200
this is an important perspective because

967
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,089
it allows us to accept the presence of

968
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,220
problems without slandering or blaming

969
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:28,490
anyone and that makes it easier to think

970
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:30,259
seriously about the issues and that

971
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:32,479
takes us to the issues and the list of

972
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:34,130
these is kind of never ending but a few

973
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,529
things that strike me our review on

974
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:38,630
negativity reviews written in ways that

975
00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:41,270
makes it difficult for other reviewers

976
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:43,430
to disprove them the presence of elites

977
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:45,440
and cliques and their effect the

978
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:47,259
rejection of papers that critique or

979
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,990
offer views different from accepted

980
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:52,150
one's a system that promotes incremental

981
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:54,040
over groundbreaking work and beyond that

982
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:57,640
just plain incompetent saleem

983
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:59,980
correctness reviewers are depressingly

984
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,500
negative pcs routinely won't routinely

985
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:05,050
want to reject everything take a typical

986
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,730
run of a process in which they may be

987
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:10,060
about 200 submissions and we're

988
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:13,060
targeting say 50 accepts and as you know

989
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:14,560
each paper is given a score by each of

990
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,440
three reviewers this cause nowadays

991
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,470
ranging from 1 to 6 with a 5 being and

992
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,470
accept so how many submissions do you

993
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:25,330
think have an average score of except at

994
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:27,310
the end of the first page when all three

995
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:29,860
reviewers have turned in their reports

996
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:32,170
well a naive outside our white say well

997
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:34,900
perhaps 70 or a hundred and that people

998
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,700
have to argue to whittle it down but you

999
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,310
know that the real answer is more like

1000
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,350
well it can be zero I've seen program

1001
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:44,200
committees like that and it's rarely

1002
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:45,880
ever more than 10 so the program

1003
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,549
committee thinks only five percent of

1004
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,020
the papers are worth accepting how often

1005
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,120
have you seen these types of board

1006
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:54,730
comments I won't fight for the paper is

1007
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:56,970
not above the bar and so forth without

1008
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:59,440
any particular indication of why not

1009
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:01,600
there are PC members who don't give an

1010
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,960
accept scored or any single paper out of

1011
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:07,420
the entire review pile after the top 10%

1012
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,950
of papers are accepted the reviews don't

1013
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:12,610
seem to actually care what happens and

1014
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:14,319
it ends up being a crapshoot some people

1015
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:16,660
say this is a good thing it means that

1016
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,770
we have high standards but I don't think

1017
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:22,120
that's what it represents for one thing

1018
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:25,150
it isn't like this in other communities

1019
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:27,609
necessarily I ask people in areas

1020
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:29,020
ranging from theory to systems and they

1021
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,490
were a bit surprised that things were

1022
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,800
like this with us and they said in their

1023
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:35,200
community things are much more positive

1024
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,880
now that doesn't mean that's true for

1025
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,910
all communities but certainly there are

1026
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,120
ones more positive than us the second

1027
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:44,620
anomaly surfaces when one observes that

1028
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:47,080
reviewers are themselves offers and

1029
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:49,210
certainly as they think very highly of

1030
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,850
their own works but if you look at this

1031
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:55,000
situation apparently they think highly

1032
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:56,710
of very little else well psychologists

1033
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,840
have a term for this or it's called a

1034
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,650
superiority bias although in this case

1035
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,060
it seems

1036
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:03,070
evident enough that you don't need an

1037
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,020
academic to give it a name and it's

1038
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:06,970
represented by the fact that most of us

1039
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:09,700
think of ourselves as above average

1040
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:11,919
drivers or for those of you are your

1041
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:14,040
garrison keillor fans that in Lake

1042
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,200
Wobegon most children are above average

1043
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,960
but I think in our context while this

1044
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,270
would say that yes most of us think we

1045
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,250
right above average papers it's not

1046
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:26,650
sufficient explanation because the gap

1047
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,270
is too big and what would be forced to

1048
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,790
say that most people are a committee

1049
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,450
think that their own work is

1050
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:35,800
substantially better than everyone

1051
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:41,230
else's and that's one reason for such a

1052
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:43,840
big gap one reason negativity prevails

1053
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:46,240
in our culture is that it we have a

1054
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,580
culture that encourages and perpetuates

1055
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,740
it in numerous ways one of these is that

1056
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:53,080
negativity makes a reviewer seem smart

1057
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,509
and reviewers like to seem smart so you

1058
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,520
consider a negative review provided by

1059
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:59,890
mean review are facing a positive one

1060
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,750
provided by a nice one and given

1061
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:03,400
comments that say that the paper is ink

1062
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:06,070
has incremental techniques and is

1063
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,590
uninteresting and so forth the wipe sent

1064
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:10,870
out is that the this person must be

1065
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:15,100
smart and well informed well the other

1066
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:16,960
one is the opposite and what a review

1067
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,640
learns that is that if they want the PC

1068
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,410
to think they're smart and of course

1069
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,069
they do want that then it's better to be

1070
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:25,420
negative and so that's what happens the

1071
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:27,610
second way in which our culture

1072
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:29,680
encourages rejection in that is that

1073
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:32,170
there's no incentive to fight for a

1074
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,779
paper consider the View for a review of

1075
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:37,420
happens to be both nice and smart but

1076
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:39,790
perhaps junior are just not pushy then

1077
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,980
there's a sort of natural rational game

1078
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:43,870
theoretic calculation which says it's

1079
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:46,150
not to my advantage to fight for a

1080
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:48,160
people because it would antagonize other

1081
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:51,040
reviewers which decreases my utility

1082
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,290
function but there's no corresponding

1083
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,150
gain because the authors will never know

1084
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:58,540
what happens so why bother to fight for

1085
00:43:55,150 --> 00:44:00,610
anything the third way in which our

1086
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:03,100
culture encourages rejection is by

1087
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:05,470
simply making it a tradition every time

1088
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:07,360
we write a nasty review what we are

1089
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,580
doing is educating its reader to write

1090
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,010
the same kinds of review

1091
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:13,410
when this graduate student gets a slew

1092
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:15,270
of rejections on his submissions the

1093
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:17,670
message he takes away is that is the job

1094
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:19,770
of a reviewer to reject and indeed when

1095
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:22,470
he comes of age and steps onto the pc

1096
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:24,030
that's what he does and this explains

1097
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:26,700
the phenomenon that puzzled me at first

1098
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:28,560
it is why is it that young first-time PC

1099
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:32,129
members are often the most negative ones

1100
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:34,529
out there another broad issue is the

1101
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,660
content of reviews in particular the

1102
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:37,890
presence of terms like these surely

1103
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,620
you've seen them the paper is not

1104
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:42,060
surprising it's trivial and as I start I

1105
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,589
have trouble even understanding what

1106
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,870
they mean or what they have to do with

1107
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,790
the quality we're trying to evaluate I

1108
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:49,200
feel like telling the review of the ones

1109
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,450
surprises they should go ride a roller

1110
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,600
coaster or in a mystery novel rather

1111
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:56,850
than review papers but more important is

1112
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,400
the position in which these types of

1113
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:01,950
comments place other reviewers or even

1114
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,690
authors who want to rebut them we speak

1115
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,299
in our community of assumptions that are

1116
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:08,160
not falsifiable meaning hard to disprove

1117
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,260
well these comments are kind of the same

1118
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,149
if someone has decided not to be

1119
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,650
surprised or interested there isn't

1120
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:15,930
really much that's going to change it

1121
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:18,330
and the result is that these kinds of

1122
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:20,549
comments are intimidating and hard to

1123
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:22,650
dislodge there ought to be some kind of

1124
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:27,060
rules that falsify comments have to be

1125
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:28,800
falsifiable it will be hard to deny that

1126
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,870
there are cliques in our community by

1127
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,230
which I mean well just groups of friends

1128
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:36,839
people in or others in either small or

1129
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:39,050
largest groups who have common interests

1130
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:42,170
who socialize they write papers together

1131
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:45,090
often they're bound by relations such as

1132
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:47,460
academic peers or advisor mentor

1133
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:49,800
relationships alums of the same place

1134
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:53,310
and so forth or they may just be working

1135
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,350
on the same topic so the click effect

1136
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:57,090
says that if members of a clique are

1137
00:45:55,350 --> 00:46:00,509
well represented on a program committee

1138
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:02,430
then papers by those members whether on

1139
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:04,320
or off the committee will have a

1140
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:06,210
disproportionate representation in the

1141
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,130
program and this is not something

1142
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:10,350
imaginary in fact it's routinely the

1143
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:12,300
case that people in our community

1144
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,880
complain about this and believe it

1145
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:17,400
happens and indeed at times it's hard to

1146
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,710
avoid that seeing that it happens just

1147
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,509
by looking at the relation between the

1148
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:24,209
composition of a program and the piece

1149
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:25,769
see now we could spend time debating or

1150
00:46:24,209 --> 00:46:27,509
arguing about the existence of the

1151
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:29,669
effect but what I'm going to suggest

1152
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:32,549
instead is that the effect is real and

1153
00:46:29,669 --> 00:46:34,859
try to ask why it happens and I believe

1154
00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:37,979
that the explanation will show in some

1155
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:40,169
ways that it must happen Mills was a

1156
00:46:37,979 --> 00:46:42,448
sociologist at Columbia University who

1157
00:46:40,169 --> 00:46:44,158
studied elites and he posted a

1158
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:47,429
fascinating effect that I'll paraphrase

1159
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:50,149
in our context as follows it says that

1160
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:52,259
the cliq effect doesn't arise due to

1161
00:46:50,149 --> 00:46:54,929
conspiracy and collusion of click

1162
00:46:52,259 --> 00:46:56,969
members it is automatic it's a result of

1163
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:59,279
their having shared culture and

1164
00:46:56,969 --> 00:47:02,429
background or in more cryptographic

1165
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:04,380
terms suppose we fix a click k that has

1166
00:47:02,429 --> 00:47:07,229
a non-trivial intersection with the pc

1167
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:09,899
and now let's consider two games in the

1168
00:47:07,229 --> 00:47:12,359
bad game the cliq members on the pc of

1169
00:47:09,899 --> 00:47:14,459
malicious they collude the dr minimize

1170
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:16,828
the papers to each other and accept

1171
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:19,529
mostly papers by click members on or off

1172
00:47:16,829 --> 00:47:22,380
the pc but in game good they behave as

1173
00:47:19,529 --> 00:47:24,239
responsible and ethical pc members they

1174
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,429
operate independently the provide water

1175
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:29,219
and their honest perspective are fair

1176
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:30,899
accurate and independent reviews but

1177
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:32,849
what Mills is saying is that these games

1178
00:47:30,899 --> 00:47:36,019
will have indistinguishable outcomes and

1179
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:39,119
thus in the second game the

1180
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:40,589
disproportionate number of papers by

1181
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,869
members of the clique that you would

1182
00:47:40,589 --> 00:47:45,449
predict in the first game will also rise

1183
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:48,149
and the reason is that it's the common

1184
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:50,489
culture values and tastes of the cliq

1185
00:47:48,149 --> 00:47:52,288
members leading to their having the same

1186
00:47:50,489 --> 00:47:55,169
kinds of opinions informing the same

1187
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:57,869
kind of judgments or put another way the

1188
00:47:55,169 --> 00:48:00,989
text in red in game good is important

1189
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:03,419
while these PC members are being ethical

1190
00:48:00,989 --> 00:48:05,729
and fair it's according to their own

1191
00:48:03,419 --> 00:48:09,618
very personal perspective and this

1192
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:12,538
perspective is in common with others

1193
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:14,519
Kuhn describes how fields are born out

1194
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:16,649
of revolutionary ideas which in our

1195
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:19,379
cases are things like public key

1196
00:48:16,649 --> 00:48:21,359
cryptography RSA or the theory of modern

1197
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:24,149
cryptography with definitions and proofs

1198
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:27,149
by reductions has given by goal Vasa and

1199
00:48:24,149 --> 00:48:29,429
Macaulay and once these revolutions take

1200
00:48:27,149 --> 00:48:30,959
place the field settles into what he

1201
00:48:29,429 --> 00:48:34,380
calls normal science where the

1202
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:35,310
establishing paradigms are accepted but

1203
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,020
in fact it is more than

1204
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:39,810
just being accepted they quickly become

1205
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:42,030
religion research is defined as solving

1206
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:44,580
clear technically challenging problems

1207
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:47,400
within the paradigm and this is very

1208
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:49,259
much the stage we are in now the salient

1209
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,450
fact from the reviewing perspective is

1210
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,370
that there's a powerful opposition to

1211
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:55,140
critique sent a novel or opposing

1212
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:57,770
viewpoints so any papers which offer

1213
00:48:55,140 --> 00:49:00,150
these things tend to be rejected

1214
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:01,920
reviewers view themselves as defenders

1215
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:04,500
of the faith and there whose job it is

1216
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,900
to protect the field from criticism and

1217
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,940
this is also phenomenon that people have

1218
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:12,450
complained about in our community and

1219
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:14,400
again rather than what I want to do is

1220
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:19,589
kind of explain it and I believe what

1221
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:22,440
Kuhn says does that PC decisions are

1222
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:24,060
largely taken by consensus arising out

1223
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,460
of discussion or reflected in the

1224
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:28,620
average score and one result is that on

1225
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,450
the borderline what is accepted rather

1226
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:33,509
than being what someone likes is what

1227
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:35,460
nobody hates and that means a mediocre

1228
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:38,130
and incremental work that's inoffensive

1229
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,230
is what's going to dominate but the

1230
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:42,660
difficulties are important work often as

1231
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:44,940
criticism as its core and it's almost

1232
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:46,560
bound to offend someone indeed you might

1233
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:49,260
say they're offending someone is almost

1234
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:52,220
a mark of character for a paper and so

1235
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:54,600
work like that is hard time getting in

1236
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:56,609
so having given all these sorts of

1237
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,710
critiques and indications of our human

1238
00:49:56,610 --> 00:50:01,230
limitations and the fundamental

1239
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:03,240
difficulty of doing good reviews I ask

1240
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:05,580
myself if there was any sort of model

1241
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:08,669
for how a reviewer ought to function in

1242
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:11,040
the ideal case and one could refer that

1243
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,170
back by analogy to the broader

1244
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:15,090
philosophic question of how best to live

1245
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:17,730
one's life and while this has been

1246
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:20,400
investigated in depth and the law of the

1247
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:21,750
world contains long answers it turns out

1248
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,000
that they all agree on this pity

1249
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:26,400
rendition that we call the golden rule

1250
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,400
and one form of that is to treat others

1251
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,930
as you would like them to treat you so I

1252
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,970
wonder if just as a thought experiment

1253
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:35,129
we could have a golden rule of reviewing

1254
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:37,049
which is to review the papers of others

1255
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:38,760
as if they were your own it would be

1256
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:40,710
kind of amusing to see the outcome of

1257
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:44,180
this being the guidelines for reviewers

1258
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:46,800
we are other hard to reject papers

1259
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:48,660
however all this all that I've said so

1260
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,369
far is a theoretical kind of view

1261
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:53,069
practice it's really not going to change

1262
00:50:50,369 --> 00:50:55,109
anything at least directly because none

1263
00:50:53,069 --> 00:50:57,509
of us think of ourselves individually as

1264
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:59,460
doing anything as reviewers we shouldn't

1265
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:00,990
and the psychologists actually have a

1266
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:04,890
name for this one as well it's called

1267
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:07,169
the bias blind spot and that takes me to

1268
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:08,819
what from a practical perspective is the

1269
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:11,010
fundamental problem with the reviewing

1270
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:13,650
process namely that there's no

1271
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:15,089
accountability there is no place to

1272
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:17,700
appeal a decision there is no way to

1273
00:51:15,089 --> 00:51:19,680
overturn a different decision and review

1274
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,839
as a subject to zero consequences

1275
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,490
regardless of their actions the

1276
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:25,020
president of the United States can be

1277
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:28,200
impeached but there's nothing to touch a

1278
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:29,970
PC member no matter what they do but we

1279
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,828
have thousands of years of human history

1280
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:34,319
to tell us that when power is not

1281
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:36,240
balanced by accountability it's going to

1282
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:39,450
get abused even by the best people with

1283
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:41,819
the best intentions in other words what

1284
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:45,210
makes peer review as we practice it a

1285
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:47,730
blatantly broken Dark Ages system is

1286
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:49,849
that it adds odds with the essence of

1287
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:52,200
human nature and the lessons of history

1288
00:51:49,849 --> 00:51:54,329
processes for decision-making and jug

1289
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,430
lynch in the real world are realistic

1290
00:51:54,329 --> 00:51:58,020
they know that decision-makers are

1291
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:00,779
biased even with the best of intentions

1292
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:03,270
and they compensate by adding checks and

1293
00:52:00,779 --> 00:52:04,859
balances and accountability and we on

1294
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:07,288
the other hand implicitly make the

1295
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:10,230
assumption that people reviewers placed

1296
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:11,880
in power are ubiquitously fair and all

1297
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:14,579
we need is to trust them and have no

1298
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,500
accountability and this is not only kind

1299
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:18,660
of ludicrous in general but we're a

1300
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,970
community whose motto is trust no one

1301
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:24,509
and when we see this it should be no

1302
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:26,609
surprise that this system fails I think

1303
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:28,410
a useful metaphor for the conference

1304
00:52:26,609 --> 00:52:30,990
decision process is to look at it as a

1305
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:32,750
court of law so think of the submitted

1306
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:35,788
paper as the queue sitting in the dock

1307
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:37,859
in both cases a binary decision must be

1308
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:40,109
reached the program committee is like a

1309
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:42,299
panel of judges the program chair is

1310
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:43,890
kind of like the chief justice perhaps

1311
00:52:42,299 --> 00:52:46,650
you could think of sub reviewers as kind

1312
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:48,720
of like witnesses but there is endless

1313
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:50,039
kind of ends there because in the real

1314
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,649
world people have understood that

1315
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:55,140
judicial systems need checks and

1316
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:58,140
balances to deliver justice and these

1317
00:52:55,140 --> 00:53:00,118
are been inserted and in our case this

1318
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:02,850
hasn't happened leading to the following

1319
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:05,130
types of differences in a court accused

1320
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:06,930
signed a lawyer to defend them who can

1321
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:08,940
object to procedures or statements

1322
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:10,859
online while they're happening while our

1323
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,050
submissions after the submitted kind of

1324
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:15,750
have to swim on their own at the mercy

1325
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:18,000
of judges in many courts debates and

1326
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:20,310
judge opinions are public in our courts

1327
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,160
as secret tribunals and we know what

1328
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:24,870
repetition those have in the real world

1329
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,580
in the real world judge appointments are

1330
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:29,009
reviewed and approved by some sort of

1331
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:31,410
semi public process which is not at all

1332
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:33,780
true in ours in the real world judges

1333
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:35,580
are appointed by external parties in our

1334
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,890
world the Chief Justice appoints all the

1335
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:39,720
rest of the panel and the real world

1336
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:42,299
decisions can be appealed and in our

1337
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:44,939
case they cannot now having said that

1338
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:47,130
one might argue that rebuttals play in

1339
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:50,670
part the role of an a defense advocate

1340
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:52,590
or that resubmission plays in part the

1341
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:54,600
role of an appeal but these I think of

1342
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:57,960
poor proxies for many reasons we don't

1343
00:53:54,600 --> 00:54:00,120
have to get into so I suppose people

1344
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:02,760
might be looking a ghost of the specter

1345
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:04,620
of lawyers and research but I wonder if

1346
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,070
it's really so preposterous look at the

1347
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:09,810
kind of comments we see on reviews and

1348
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:11,550
the things written in blue here have you

1349
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:14,009
ever found yourself asking on saying

1350
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:16,440
things like that where was my lawyer to

1351
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:18,480
provide the simple Roberto shown in

1352
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,860
orange then these things shouldn't be

1353
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,290
happening but at present there isn't

1354
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:24,180
anything to stop them but still I should

1355
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:26,460
be clear that a court of law for me is

1356
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:28,500
merely a metaphor here I'm not trying to

1357
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:31,290
advocate that we actually explicitly

1358
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:33,270
mimic the processes but just that it's a

1359
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:37,440
useful comparison point to bring home

1360
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:39,870
some of the gaps in the system so that

1361
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,490
brings us kind of the objects obvious

1362
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:43,470
question which is well if there are so

1363
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:45,000
many questions at least from some

1364
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:47,310
perspectives whatever is that we should

1365
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,790
do well I don't know what the answer to

1366
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:52,950
that is another of my favorite authors

1367
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:55,259
daniel quinn in one of his books mounts

1368
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:57,600
a kind of all-encompassing critique of

1369
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,250
human culture and when the protagonist

1370
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,440
in the book is asked what to do about it

1371
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:03,780
his answers treated as a problem and

1372
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,390
think and I'm afraid that's the best i

1373
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:08,460
can offer as well imagine that we spend

1374
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:10,710
five percent of our research time not on

1375
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,170
the technical questions within the

1376
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:15,150
discipline we usually concentrate on but

1377
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:16,590
on understand and improving culture in

1378
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:18,930
particular peer review

1379
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:21,030
you surely a community as creative as

1380
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:23,819
ours would come up with not one but many

1381
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:25,080
ways in which to improve things I would

1382
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,340
imagine that these would have to be

1383
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:29,000
tested we would come up with

1384
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:32,430
experimental venues and so forth and

1385
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,820
have to spend some time sorting things

1386
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:37,910
out there's a lot of ideas external to

1387
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:40,170
us that we can look at decision making

1388
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:42,839
even let's say like in the Olympics

1389
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:44,660
we're in some competitions the highest

1390
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:47,400
and lowest judge scores are dropped

1391
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:50,879
canimals book has a fascinating account

1392
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,920
of how he took the Israeli army

1393
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,410
interview process for pilots or

1394
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:58,410
something and which was not working well

1395
00:55:55,410 --> 00:56:01,529
and introduced a kind of narrow set of

1396
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:03,750
review criteria coupled with automation

1397
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:08,310
and got substantially better results and

1398
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:10,290
there many other such things our culture

1399
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:12,390
is around us everywhere like the air we

1400
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:15,000
breathe and I think we benefit from

1401
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:16,500
making his presence more explicit I've

1402
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,860
said a lot of things today that are

1403
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:21,750
certainly opinionated personal possibly

1404
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:24,090
flawed it would be very easy to poke

1405
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:26,700
holes and anything I say but this is

1406
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:28,650
fuzzy unexplored territory and I've

1407
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,210
tried to tread this path because I think

1408
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:32,910
it matters to us that I think we should

1409
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:35,460
spend time understanding our culture and

1410
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:38,700
then using that understanding as a basis

1411
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:40,910
for change and thanks for your time and

1412
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,910
attention
