[Music]

5
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,900
thank you

6
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,259
okay uh hello everyone so it's like and

7
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,780
I'll introduce you I'm sorry

8
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,060
so our next speaker will be uh Claymont

9
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,799
chevinya who will be speaking about new

10
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,900
icard type encodings from elliptic curve

11
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,159
out of our business

12
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,659
thank you

13
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,200
uh so yeah I will be talking to you

14
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,200
about an attempt from meditibushi and I

15
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
at building new hash functions to

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,960
analytical Inspire taking inspiration of

17
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,340
the construction of Ikea type encodings

18
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,320
um I will Begin by presenting the

19
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,360
motivations for this work then I will

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,540
introduce some preliminary Notions that

21
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,399
are called exceptional covers and I will

22
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,739
also explain how to find some and

23
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,900
finally I will present the details of

24
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,800
the construction of a new hash function

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,660
so the first question we can ask

26
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,319
ourselves here is why do we need hash

27
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,360
functions to add elliptic curves for

28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,120
well you can see on this slide that

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,860
there is a lot of cryptographic

30
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,860
algorithm that make use of this kind of

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,019
hash functions like for example you can

32
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,660
think of identity based encryption

33
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,420
schemes Like Bernie Franklin one you can

34
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,319
think on of a parent-based signatures

35
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,459
like BLS and so on and maybe seeing all

36
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,560
of this some of you are thinking okay

37
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,360
there is a simple solution to get the

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,700
hash functions we need suppose that you

39
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,760
want to Hash well an elliptical e that

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,040
has a base Point p and that you already

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,300
have a hash toward the integral's

42
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,080
modular n you can simply send an element

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,239
of

44
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,959
fq2 D Point device Point P added h of M

45
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,360
time and this should give you a suitable

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,920
hash Junction right

47
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,640
well actually this is uh not a very good

48
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,159
candidate because the problem with this

49
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,319
construction is that everyone that knows

50
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,040
uh the original hash function H knows

51
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,720
the discrete logarithm of the final

52
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,959
point so if we want to use this kind of

53
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,140
naive construction with a cryptographic

54
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,000
algorithm that have their security

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,760
relying on the discrete logarithm

56
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,840
problem for example this is this is very

57
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,159
problematic

58
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,819
so this is why we will need to use hash

59
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,560
functions that are a little bit more

60
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,239
sophisticated

61
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,939
currently we distinguish mainly two

62
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,519
types of families for health functions

63
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,799
to add elliptic curve the first one is

64
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,980
called sweu type encodings and the

65
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,500
second one that we will be interested

66
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,260
into is called icart type encodings

67
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,279
and we can we can consider that this

68
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,858
kind of encoding in is structured in the

69
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,060
following way

70
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,540
uh suppose that consider the projective

71
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,900
line P1 an elliptic curve tlde that is

72
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,780
the curve you want to reach and another

73
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,240
curve see that is not necessarily

74
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,120
elliptic and suppose that you have a

75
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,199
rational map PI from C to P1 that is by

76
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,199
adjective and a cover from the curve C

77
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,620
to tlde then you can consider the

78
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,860
encoding H defined as the composition of

79
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,979
the cover F and the inverse map of Pi

80
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,380
and the interesting thing with this kind

81
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,680
of construction is that because the

82
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,979
Russian map Pi is bijective we can

83
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,900
we can show that

84
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,900
um the engine age has a lot of nice

85
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,080
properties and we can't use a lot of

86
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,300
classical harsh functions construction

87
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,340
with it and it will give us something

88
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,280
that meets all the classical security

89
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,100
requirements for this kind of object

90
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,400
so um at least in my opinion I think

91
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,800
this is a very elegant encoding however

92
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,080
if you look at the original article from

93
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,880
you see that he only gave one family of

94
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,479
Curves C for each elliptic curve tlde we

95
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,120
could want to reach

96
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,699
um so the natural question that arises

97
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,000
here is is it possible to uh to

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,699
generalize this uh this construction and

99
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:53,100
to use it with maybe different kind of

100
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,479
curved C

101
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,580
and this is exactly what we will be

102
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,940
trying to do today and for this we will

103
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,039
consider two steps the first one is to

104
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,860
be able to build curve C that have a

105
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,060
bijective rational map toward P1 and the

106
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,600
second step is uh given the the curve C

107
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,180
to find covers towards elliptic curve

108
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,880
tlde

109
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,220
so before explaining in detail how we

110
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,060
are going to do that I need to introduce

111
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,000
the concept of exceptional cover

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
um suppose that you have two curves X

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,819
and Y defined over of Midfield a finite

114
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,300
field fq and that you have a function f

115
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,960
from X to Y we can say that f is an

116
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,539
exceptional cover from X to Y if it

117
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:47,720
induces a bijection from X to Y on every

118
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,720
extension of fq that is of degree Tico

119
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,259
Prime to an integer m a fixed integer m

120
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:58,500
uh so by extension we can also say that

121
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,560
a polynomial or a rational function uh

122
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,080
defined of our fq is exceptional if it

123
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,940
induces a map from P1 to P1 that is an

124
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,319
exceptional cover

125
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,539
and unfortunately this can be a little

126
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,520
bit confusing but an exceptional cover

127
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,639
can also be a curve namely we will say

128
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,699
that a curve X is an exceptional cover

129
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,180
of another curve y if there exists a

130
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,340
function from X to Y that is an

131
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,960
exceptional cover

132
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,539
uh so there is something important to

133
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,180
note here two slides ago I said that the

134
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,580
first step for construction would be to

135
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,740
look for curve C that would have a

136
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,280
bijective map toward P1

137
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,740
to be more precise what we will be doing

138
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,259
is that we will be looking for curve C

139
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,780
that have that have that are exceptional

140
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,780
covers of P1 the difference is that we

141
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,840
don't want uh pi to be by adjective only

142
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,300
on fq we want it to be by adjective on

143
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,860
uh in infinitely many extensions of fq

144
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,780
um fortunately for us we have a very

145
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,639
interesting result from

146
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,520
um from Bisson and tibushi that gives us

147
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,759
a methodology to build a polynomial and

148
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,259
rational functions that are exceptional

149
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,979
cover namely uh if you consider an

150
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:24,360
isogeny Phi from a analytic curve e to

151
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,740
another one

152
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,360
that is of prime degree 2005. uh the

153
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,279
three following conditions are

154
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,120
equivalent so if the expressional map UV

155
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,620
has no fq rational pole it also means

156
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,740
that there is there isn't any point of

157
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,560
the kernel of Phi that has its

158
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,320
coordinate in fq square and it also

159
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,860
means that the expressional map new Phi

160
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,620
is an exceptional rational function

161
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,680
and uh fortunately for us it's not very

162
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,279
difficult to find isogenify that meets

163
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,920
this requirement for example you can

164
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,140
consider an elliptic curve e that has no

165
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,019
M torsion points over xq square and

166
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,920
consider any isogeny of degree M and it

167
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,779
will give you something suitable for

168
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,580
this result

169
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,060
so here we have uh we have a pretty

170
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,660
um

171
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,720
easy way to build polynomials and

172
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,160
rational functions that are exceptional

173
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
covers but what we want is a curve that

174
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,540
is an exceptional cover of P1

175
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,820
so to do that we will need another

176
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,180
result from freed that is the following

177
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,959
if you consider any uh any polynomial G

178
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,080
defined over fq and ufi that is an

179
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,760
exception an exceptional rational

180
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,420
function the QRC defined by this

181
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,060
equation is itself an exceptional

182
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,000
rational an expressional cover of P1 if

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,040
you consider the projection on the y

184
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,540
coordinate

185
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,600
so this result combined combined with

186
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,079
the previous one gives us a useful way

187
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,440
to to build exceptional covers of P1

188
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,740
uh in the following slide we will mainly

189
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,760
consider one polynomial G that is y

190
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,100
squared and we will consider this kind

191
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,079
of curve C with a small change of

192
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:20,279
variable

193
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,240
uh so uh yeah uh please please note that

194
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,360
we can always uh in our setup decompose

195
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,779
the extortional map u5 as the equation

196
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,420
of a polynomial U by the square of

197
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,800
another polynomial V

198
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,519
um okay so uh we we managed to complete

199
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,160
the to yeah to complete the first step

200
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,000
of or encoding construction uh now we

201
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,240
wish to be able to find a covers from

202
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,240
the curve C to elliptic curves TLD

203
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,500
actually this is not a very easy thing

204
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,200
to do because I mean we could think

205
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,680
about listing every kind of exceptional

206
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,920
covers see we can find with hydrogenase

207
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,920
and then trying to see which elliptic

208
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,260
curve we want to we can reach from them

209
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,940
but this would

210
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,120
more or less consists in building a

211
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,560
database of pairs C and tle that worked

212
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,200
with this construction and this is very

213
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,779
impractical if we want to if we want to

214
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,060
use this construction

215
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,519
uh for a real life application what we

216
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,260
need precisely is a parameterized

217
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,600
equations for the care of C D cover F

218
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,760
and the curved tlde so that we can

219
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,380
choose the parameter accordingly

220
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,920
depending on which electric we want to

221
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,219
reach

222
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,139
um so we tried uh several things uh

223
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:55,079
several approaches to uh to do that and

224
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,779
there is one that leads to surprisingly

225
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:01,620
simple expressions for the cover F and

226
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,079
the final elliptic curved here that I'm

227
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,459
going to present

228
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,560
so the setup is the following uh

229
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,720
consider that we work in a finite field

230
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,860
uh fq that contains a cube root of unity

231
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,320
Omega and non-trivial cube root of unity

232
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,019
and that we are working with a original

233
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:22,740
elliptic curve EB defined with this

234
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,579
equation so that the elliptic of EB has

235
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,480
an automorphism of degree 3 defined by

236
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,820
the root Omega

237
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,639
um in this case we know what the

238
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,000
endomorphism Ring of EB will look like

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,720
and uh uh so we we know it's isomorphic

240
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,519
to uh the to the the quadratic uh ring

241
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,240
that is that of Omega and this allows us

242
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,120
to know that uh the curve EB will always

243
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,720
have two endomorphisms of degree seven

244
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,779
uh that are defined like this and that

245
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,300
will commute with the action of the

246
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,720
automorphism of other tree

247
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,300
um and actually because uh because those

248
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,240
two endomorphisms commute with this

249
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,700
automorphism we know that they will have

250
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,880
a quite particular structure that is uh

251
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,040
detailed right here

252
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,300
so uh actually we can consider the curve

253
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,899
C defined by the expressional map of uh

254
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,019
of those two uh degree 7 endomorphisms

255
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,680
and we can also consider uh the cover F

256
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,040
defined by this equation right here that

257
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,820
will go from the curve C to analytic

258
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,420
curve tlde that has this equation and

259
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,839
you can see that the uh the equations

260
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:54,060
defining F and TLD are pretty convenient

261
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,420
um furthermore it's possible to explicit

262
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,639
the expression of the two degree 7

263
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,139
endomorphisms so um in uh in the

264
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,720
rational field uh we get this kind of

265
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,160
expressions for uh U Phi 1 and u52

266
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,579
and uh this tells that this tells us

267
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:17,639
that we are able to uh to reach the

268
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,579
following elliptic curve till E1 and

269
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:25,980
tld2 with those two endomorphisms

270
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,800
um and here at first sight it seems that

271
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,860
the equation defining tilde1 and tld2

272
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,399
are depending on decoecision B uh that

273
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,820
allowed that allowed us to define the

274
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,560
original uh curve EB okay so maybe you

275
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,160
are thinking uh cool we can choose any

276
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,339
value for B we would want to and we can

277
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,980
reach any kind of a tick curve we want

278
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,160
well actually uh it's not that simple if

279
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,380
you look a little bit closely at what we

280
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,760
just did you can see that the original

281
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,860
elliptic curve EB always has the same G

282
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,160
environment that is zero and remember

283
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,459
that we want the the degree 7

284
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:13,980
endomorphisms Phi 1 and Phi 2 2

285
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,779
Define exceptional covers of P1 so this

286
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,380
happened this happens actually only if

287
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,320
uh those two quantities uh are not a

288
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,100
cube in the finite field fq so this

289
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,079
leaves us with

290
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,300
um two-thirds of the possible choices

291
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,519
for the coefficient B that are suitable

292
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,060
for what we want to do and finally if

293
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,420
you if you compute the G in variant of

294
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,899
the two final curves uh tilde E1 and TL

295
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,920
E2 you see that we have the two

296
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,600
following formulas that are completely

297
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,259
independent of the coefficient B so

298
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:58,920
actually uh what we are able to do here

299
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,880
is that we can re we can hash toward

300
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,880
two possible Gene variants for each

301
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,820
queue and for each of these Gene

302
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,699
variants we can reach for isomorphism

303
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:15,180
classes of Curves

304
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,259
so now that we have our encoding uh

305
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:21,180
defined the first question we can ask

306
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,800
ourselves is is it secure enough well I

307
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,380
won't go too much into the details of

308
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,820
the security of this construction

309
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,800
because

310
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,000
um well because our construction is

311
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,199
structured in the same way as

312
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,560
I get one is we can use exactly the same

313
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,860
kind of argument to to show that the

314
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,920
final encoding H that we get is well

315
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,240
distributed and strongly well

316
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,660
distributed which means that we can use

317
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,360
any typical construction of hash

318
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,740
functions with

319
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,759
so if you want a concrete example

320
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,039
consider two hash functions H1 and H2

321
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,220
and the final construction uh described

322
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,919
right here when we send an element mu to

323
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:14,699
um

324
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,839
to the encoding of H1 of U plus the the

325
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,740
encoding of H2 of mu

326
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,400
um

327
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,600
we can show that if H1 and H2 are in

328
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,179
independent random Oracle of our fq then

329
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,640
the final hash function we have with

330
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,840
this construction will be

331
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,120
indifferentiable from a random Oracle

332
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,299
toward TLD

333
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,640
uh the second question we need to ask

334
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,860
ourselves is

335
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,020
um okay we have our construction ready

336
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,940
but how are we going to uh to uh compute

337
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,000
it concretely I mean given an input why

338
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,059
how are we going to um to compute the

339
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:04,620
final Point uh be Associated to Y well

340
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,539
if you look at the structure of our

341
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,760
construction you can see that we can

342
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,160
once again distinguish two steps to do

343
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,520
this the first one is to find the point

344
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,000
of the curve C that is that corresponds

345
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,780
to the input Y and this is equivalent

346
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,900
to finding a root of the polynomial

347
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,780
right here and the second step is once

348
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,780
we have the curve of the the point of

349
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,600
the curve C Associated to the input y to

350
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,320
compute uh the uh to evaluate the cover

351
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,299
F

352
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:44,280
on the point of the curve C

353
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,100
the second step is a straightforward if

354
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,559
you remember the equation we have for f

355
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,900
it's really easy to do so so the

356
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,740
difficult part is here is the first step

357
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,220
um a native way to to do this would be

358
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,580
to use an algorithm such as counters as

359
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,640
in house one for example to just find

360
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,799
the root corresponding to the input y

361
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:12,720
but this would not be a very uh wise uh

362
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,400
strategy because we want our encoding to

363
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,780
well we want to be able to compute our

364
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,299
encoding in constant times and this is

365
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,960
very uh this is not easy to do that if

366
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,539
we want to use probabilistic algorithms

367
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,360
such as control system house one for

368
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,919
example so actually we know that the um

369
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,080
the rational function ufi is exceptional

370
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,260
so this allows us to know that we can

371
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,860
solve it by radicals uh and moreover we

372
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,220
have a very useful article from fagal

373
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,520
and Lazar that gives us a guideline to

374
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,080
express explicitly the uh the root of

375
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,159
this polynomial so this is uh actually

376
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,860
not too difficult to the to do

377
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,919
um

378
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,940
okay so to conclude this presentation

379
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,179
we distinguished two steps to uh to

380
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,860
build hash function uh based on icat um

381
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,900
methodology the first one is to be able

382
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,240
to build a curves that are exceptional

383
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,860
covers of P1

384
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,659
uh and we do that from uh isogenes of

385
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:33,240
elliptic curves and the second step is

386
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,200
to find covers from such curves C to uh

387
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,520
two elliptic curve tlde so far with this

388
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,580
method we are able to build two

389
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,820
encodings toward two Gene variants of

390
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,640
elliptic curves for each uh for each

391
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,900
value of Q we could use and we know that

392
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,440
our encoding has the same security level

393
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,280
as a ecard one and it we also know that

394
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,820
we can evaluate it in constant times but

395
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,919
of course for Real Life Application

396
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,200
being able to reach only two Gene

397
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,380
variants for each

398
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,600
characteristic we could want to to use

399
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,200
is not very practical so it seems

400
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,120
necessary to to explore other approaches

401
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,460
with this methodology and this is the

402
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,299
work in progress

403
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,320
um thank you very much for your

404
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,840
attention uh if you have questions go

405
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,080
ahead if not no problem

406
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,740
thank you

407
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,159
okay so um that was very nice talk so

408
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:50,780
would anybody like to ask a question

409
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,140
yeah it's here and um do we have any

410
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,760
questions on Zoom are there any

411
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,159
questions on Zoom

412
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,340
thank you

413
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,780
okay

414
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,919
um I'm curious

415
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,299
um if you could say a couple more words

416
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,340
about the um about reaching other JM

417
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,020
variants what sort of

418
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,640
destruction and what sort of new tool

419
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,520
might be needed uh to reach a more

420
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,620
Olympic government yeah

421
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,919
um well uh currently the the main

422
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,340
strategy we are exploring is

423
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,419
um

424
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:29,159
uh well how do I explain it we have a a

425
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,860
theorem in a

426
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:37,320
in a polygamous Brown that gives us a

427
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,640
simple criteria to know if a genus2

428
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,620
curve can be

429
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,720
um uh well can have covers to our empty

430
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,179
curves it consists in looking in the

431
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:54,360
factorization of the degree 5 term in

432
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,419
the equation defining the the genosto

433
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:03,419
curve and we are trying to to see if

434
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:07,799
we can build this kind of genosto Curves

435
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:12,179
with a degree 5 exceptional the degree

436
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,400
five isogenes that gives us exceptional

437
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,220
rational map and then to factorize them

438
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,400
and express the cover explicitly

439
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,059
um

440
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:24,240
which is uh time consuming unfortunately

441
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,600
because we have to express uh roots for

442
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,799
this and well

443
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,419
it's so it's very complicated but

444
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,760
currently that's what we're trying to do

445
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,360
to which our goal great thank you let's

446
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,200
thank our speaker again

447
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,820
[Applause]

448
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,820
thank you
