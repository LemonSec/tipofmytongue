1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,360
and um i i'll give the the word to our

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,000
moderator professor leila bettina that

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we are very happy to have you here leila

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,480
patina um please the floor is yours

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,280
uh thanks francisco

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,720
so uh i'm glad to be here at least

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,039
remotely i i find this quite a challenge

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,359
but let's see how it goes and i got sort

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,240
of

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,560
promise from san francisco that he will

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,519
be my backup in case uh yeah

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,960
uh the

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
connection is not so smooth and it's not

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,280
so easy to to do it a distance but yeah

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,440
let's let's try to do the best we can i

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,840
understand we have two panelists also

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,800
remotely melt them and or

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,360
uh but that's also although uh all of

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,800
you were participating already uh today

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,480
before i think it's nice maybe for

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,039
people that maybe just join now to have

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,719
a quick round

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,440
uh so there are again four panelists in

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,800
this last

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,320
uh table which is called lessons learned

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,879
which means we'll try to to follow up on

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,240
on the most

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,320
important things that are mentioned

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,240
today and maybe

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,400
a bit of

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,799
forward-looking with respect to uh

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,280
agility standardizations and all these

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,479
issues that were discussed today so i'd

34
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,720
like to to to ask each of you to say a

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,640
few words just to introduce yourself and

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,680
then we take it from there so we have uh

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,000
first brian lamacchia brian is there i

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,119
see

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,600
yep hi laila uh so

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,840
hi everyone again uh brian lomachia from

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,000
microsoft research and the security and

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
cryptography team there

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,920
that does uh some of the post quantum

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,200
submissions

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,119
uh i'll leave it at that

46
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,799
hello everyone i'm raphael so i'm

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,560
working i'm working with google on the

48
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
pqc transition and i'm also working on a

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,640
couple submissions now considered by

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,520
nice in the fourth round and i also

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,439
maintain i'm one of the maintainers of

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,200
the thinq which is the google

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,119
cryptographic library

54
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,399
and and that's it

55
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
thanks

56
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,840
malcolm

57
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,319
hello uh my name is malcolm so i'm

58
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,120
restaurant i am i have been working at

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,360
nist for the last 13 years and

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,800
co-leading the

61
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
this lightweight crypto standardization

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,280
process and also involved with other

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
symmetric key related standards

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,959
thanks malcolm

65
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,480
and or

66
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,879
i guess

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:33,760
well

68
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,680
i'm professor of computer science at the

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,319
university of haifa in israel

70
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,239
i'm not working neither for industry nor

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,840
for government so i guess i'm also

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,319
representing academia here so tough luck

73
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,640
for me

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,959
okay thanks thanks all for introducing

75
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,000
yourself so yeah let's let's start a bit

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,280
more general and um in in this in the

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
spirit of

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,920
uh the main theme today

79
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,040
so the first question would be

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,519
so based on on what we heard today and

81
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,319
what we kind of learned so far

82
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,640
how would you address the problem of

83
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,360
crypto agility assuming that there is a

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,360
problem

85
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,879
so where should we

86
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,599
take it from

87
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,720
anyone

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,560
maybe i can start

89
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,360
so um

90
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,319
so in my perspective we are writing the

91
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,080
standards right even

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,200
um

93
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,360
crypto agility is also a problem in

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,080
standardization part as well not just uh

95
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,519
you know we have

96
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,319
algorithms implemented in the field but

97
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,799
also it's a problem for

98
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,239
uh standardization so how quick can nist

99
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,239
respond to attacks so

100
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,159
uh

101
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,480
it is it is we see that it's very

102
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,879
challenging and it takes a lot of time

103
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,360
for this to respond even to you know

104
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,159
getting rid of xiao on right now we're

105
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,760
still working on

106
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,799
uh

107
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,720
because of the push from the industry we

108
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,200
have all these implementations

109
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,560
what happens if the you know if

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
the application only uses

111
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,279
pre-image resistance of sha-1 not

112
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,360
collision resistance so there is a push

113
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,400
from the industry

114
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,639
so it's also challenging to update the

115
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,600
standards when there is an attack so and

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,240
also i want to mention that uh due to

117
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,440
this like last year nist uh

118
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,600
formed this crypto review publication

119
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,040
review board

120
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,360
so that we can actually periodically go

121
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,240
over all of our standards and make sure

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,479
that we are up to date with all the

123
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,360
challenge you know updates in the crypto

124
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,880
research so

125
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,680
uh i just wanted to highlight this is a

126
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,520
challenge in even in the standardization

127
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,160
[Music]

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,240
process as well not just everything in

129
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,840
the field

130
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,440
what happens to the algorithm to the

131
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,400
field

132
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,160
thanks malcolm

133
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,560
um someone wants to add something to

134
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,800
this

135
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,759
uh maybe i can just add that from a

136
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,680
system perspective i think you need to

137
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,280
to think about cryptogenics since the

138
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,000
the early design of our systems this is

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,080
not something that we've been doing uh

140
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,280
in the past

141
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,880
and i think for example building a

142
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,840
system with just an abstract description

143
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,680
of what kind of cryptographic feature we

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,720
expect

145
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,400
and and create

146
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,680
develop the software in a way that any

147
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,000
implementation that meets those cri

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
those requirements would be

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
uh suitable for that implementation so i

150
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,840
think that's kind of a different

151
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,400
paradigm on how we develop software

152
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,000
and i think that's very much needed

153
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,198
okay

154
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,680
if i may add actually

155
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,400
to what russia was just saying think of

156
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,080
the harder we also have harder

157
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,919
implementations running around and you

158
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,440
see it mostly in the lightweight crypto

159
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,960
competition context this was in the

160
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,520
discussion in the last

161
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,880
panel

162
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,080
harder

163
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,240
to begin with is less agile than

164
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,560
software unless you go to fpgas but then

165
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
they carry with them some cost

166
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,000
and and going back to the

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,919
standardization of having a single

168
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,520
option versus many options you can look

169
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,280
at iso standards

170
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,720
uh iso says oh you can use any of these

171
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,039
block ciphers just pick any of those and

172
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,639
they are going to be fine

173
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,479
and this causes quite a lot of havoc and

174
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,080
problems

175
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,840
both for implementers and for other

176
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,520
reasons i mean

177
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,160
so having too many options is also that

178
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
of a good idea when you think of the

179
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,720
ecosystem

180
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,759
and uh i'll just add on to this um

181
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,520
going back to the question of the

182
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
standards work and say the fact that

183
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,039
nist has to update a bunch of their own

184
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,039
standards once the post quantum

185
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,400
standards get done things that depend

186
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,560
upon it that's true in a lot of parts

187
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,639
other parts of the broad standards

188
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,000
community as well

189
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,479
you know we tend to think a lot about

190
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,639
tls is the prime example when we're

191
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,880
thinking about a communications protocol

192
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,039
and the negotiation that's already built

193
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,240
into it and we think that we've got a

194
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,960
good

195
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,000
handle on agility there but there are a

196
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,759
lot of protocols that we depend upon

197
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,280
every day for internet communication

198
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,880
that have absolutely no

199
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,120
algorithmic agility in them right now

200
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,720
as an example the last time i looked at

201
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,120
dkim the one that is used to sign email

202
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,919
headers between mail transport agents

203
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,840
specified the algorithms fixed and

204
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,759
didn't have any ability to do any

205
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,960
agility they're gonna have to do some

206
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,360
updates a lot of other standards will do

207
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
updates and that's why this

208
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,840
cascade of dependencies among

209
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,759
internet standards documents

210
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,759
is gonna keep us all employed for a very

211
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,919
long time and and i'm glad that we're

212
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,080
all going to have work to do for a while

213
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,840
and i'm only slightly facetious at that

214
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,000
point

215
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,960
okay so so like it seems like

216
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,080
all of you identify the issue but how do

217
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,198
we deal with it what what should be done

218
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,199
well it's an architectural principle

219
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,240
right and this is the sort of thing that

220
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,560
we as practitioners in the field

221
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,879
not only need to recognize and advocate

222
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,120
for but constantly make sure that the

223
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,559
systems we build the protocols we design

224
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,320
the systems we acquire and purchase

225
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,958
meet our cryptographic agility needs

226
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,880
right it is unfortunately the sort of

227
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,000
thing that you have to constantly

228
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,720
refresh in people's minds that this is

229
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,680
an important security design principle

230
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,600
and that if systems are not designed

231
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,440
with agility mind you're going to end up

232
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,120
having to go back and fix them later

233
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,680
and it is it there is tension like you

234
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,320
heard earlier today between that and

235
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,560
other features but

236
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,240
this is the sort of thing that you can't

237
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,640
be lacks about and

238
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,279
it's an ongoing it's an ongoing you know

239
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,800
software and hardware development issue

240
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,640
and is there something that ongoing

241
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,320
competitions could um could take as as a

242
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,200
message like how to to address this

243
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,360
issue while running competition at the

244
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,920
same time

245
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,399
well i don't think the fact that we're

246
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,440
running

247
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,560
a competition stops the need for agility

248
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
and design i mean as rafael said i mean

249
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
you know you can

250
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,640
you can specify the requirements of it

251
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,560
and you can test with things that are

252
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,320
out there i mean i think this is one of

253
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,080
the best things about the open quantum

254
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
safe projects from the beginning was

255
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,519
that it put

256
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,519
a cryptographically agile library out

257
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,080
there that allowed people to go test

258
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,480
all of the pqc candidates at a

259
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,320
particular stage or almost all of them

260
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,920
relatively easily and you can see what

261
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,000
the impact is and in fact that's advice

262
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,279
i've been giving customers for a few

263
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,720
years now when someone would come in

264
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,760
from

265
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,240
a particular vertical industry that said

266
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,079
well what are we going to have to do i

267
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,600
said well why don't you go try things

268
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,920
out especially in your proprietary

269
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
implementations of protocols that are

270
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
totally within your environment

271
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
start doing the work now even if you're

272
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,160
testing against an algorithm that isn't

273
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,519
what nist

274
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,880
shows as the winner or one of a winner

275
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,800
the fact that you do it and that you

276
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,839
have tested to see that

277
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,600
you know your your protocol works with

278
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
something like frodo is going to prove

279
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,160
that you can handle large key sizes and

280
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,240
larger signatures or you know encryption

281
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,839
sizes and things like that that will be

282
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,360
relevant to whatever was eventually

283
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,040
chosen so

284
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,880
the opportunity's been there

285
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,399
and the opportunity will continue to be

286
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,320
there through round four and through the

287
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,720
second call for signatures and it's not

288
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,480
a reason for

289
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,839
the fact that competition's going on

290
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,680
it's not a reason to not do the work now

291
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,279
i guess the way i'll put it

292
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,120
yeah i was just more of a question can

293
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,760
we do it better knowing about all these

294
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,079
issues like already kind of

295
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,040
uh

296
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,880
plan for that for for

297
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,920
easier

298
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,079
kind of agility later on

299
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,320
i i think we've known of kg of crypto

300
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,600
agility since the 90s right

301
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,040
and

302
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,720
the early designs if you look at the

303
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,959
early designs of crypto agility like

304
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,279
ipsec or tls

305
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,519
had their own notion of a sort of a

306
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,680
crypto objective

307
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,399
some of it worked better than others and

308
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,480
there is you know

309
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,360
more agility in my in in some of them

310
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,839
and less in others but we're almost 30

311
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,279
years later and we still don't

312
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,959
understand

313
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,279
agility correctly or to the point that

314
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,440
we can say oh here is this uh

315
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,839
abstraction level that just says oh we

316
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,920
need a public key crypto system that is

317
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,720
secure we need a symmetric

318
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
cryptosystem which is secure unless you

319
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,040
open the theory papers where they do

320
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,600
this abstraction level but i'm not aware

321
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,720
of any

322
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,639
cryptographic library that says oh you

323
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,320
just you know

324
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,800
he just plug in whatever you want we

325
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,200
would work that way and and one of the

326
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,880
problems is because think of implement

327
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,040
think of the implementation now whether

328
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,200
it's software hardware it's very hard to

329
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,839
make good implementations

330
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,560
so by opening up the api to allow for

331
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
any you know think of an open ssl

332
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,160
implementation that you can pull

333
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,839
whatever public key crypto system that

334
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,519
you want in

335
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,320
and

336
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,560
it will fix everything for you

337
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,760
i think

338
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,680
it's going to be held to to make it

339
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,079
secure so i'm

340
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,880
i'm not sure maybe rafael can uh shed

341
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,200
some more light how google is doing that

342
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,440
in their library but some something here

343
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,959
is obviously

344
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,680
not consistent with our other tasks

345
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,120
of making everything secure

346
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,519
can you repeat your question i'm not

347
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,120
sure i understand actually

348
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,560
sorry so one way the standard way in in

349
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,839
programming

350
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,320
to have sort of an agility is to have

351
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,240
some api right so

352
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
the crypto library is going to have an

353
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,480
api that says encrypt and then you say

354
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,720
oh i need the public key

355
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,560
cryptosystem afterwards i need the

356
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,639
symmetric encryption system and etc

357
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,680
this api is going to be linked to some

358
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,000
library that does public key and then

359
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,839
symmetrically and then everything and

360
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,839
you just change things underneath it's

361
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,440
just that when you have

362
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
multiple implementations

363
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,079
then suddenly you have issues with side

364
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,839
channel attacks you have timing attacks

365
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,560
microarchitectural attacks i mean that

366
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,720
sort of stuff so

367
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,000
how the balance look from your

368
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,160
perspective is the

369
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,560
one handling this situation

370
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,720
yeah no i think your point yeah it's

371
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,120
very valid like we need to see how this

372
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,680
uh various schemes would be implemented

373
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,519
how mature they are how resistant your

374
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,120
side channel attacks they are i'm

375
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,839
totally with you um but i think this

376
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,680
doesn't contradict the fact that we need

377
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,560
to have a generic framework so that if

378
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,360
we

379
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,079
if we have good options we can easily

380
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,639
switch i think that's my my main point

381
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,440
for example i can give an example

382
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,519
uh we work on tync which is google's

383
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,079
cryptographic library and in think what

384
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,040
we do is we don't have a key we have a

385
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,240
key set so we each key is in fact like a

386
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,000
collection of keys

387
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,320
and the primitives are defined very

388
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,120
abstractly so that you send a key set

389
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,480
instead of a key

390
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,040
and if you rotate your key for example

391
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,160
you it could be a transparent uh process

392
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,079
you have a given key for example that

393
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,639
you are using until now and in in the

394
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,880
future you switch to another key this

395
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,040
key will be still part of the same

396
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,839
abstract concept of a key set so this is

397
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,920
kind of one uh

398
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,240
technique to make for example key

399
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,199
rotation easier and eventually maybe

400
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,199
also um

401
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,199
allow multiple crypto algorithms

402
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,440
performing the same primitive

403
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,480
um this could be one one one way of

404
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,279
respecting the api as you said but still

405
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,199
having some degree of flexibility in

406
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,920
terms of crypto implementations

407
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,000
yes

408
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,680
doesn't this imply that cold boot

409
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,560
attacks become easier

410
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,639
and things like row hunter because if

411
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,959
you if you keep on holding a key for the

412
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,720
key rotation suddenly it's

413
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,759
it's

414
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,079
the validity period or the period it

415
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,839
exists somewhere is longer so

416
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,560
can you repeat that i'm not sure if i

417
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,600
can so

418
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,480
so

419
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,759
my question is

420
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,079
if you hold on to the key after it is

421
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,040
valid

422
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,880
for a longer period of time because of

423
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,279
uh key rotation issues

424
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,440
doesn't this imply that

425
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,839
a cold boot attacks or other side

426
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,079
channel attacks that look at the memory

427
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,480
in some sort of manner are more likely

428
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,320
to happen

429
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,759
uh

430
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,360
if i understand your question it's about

431
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
like having keys for a long period of

432
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,839
time since you rotated and whether this

433
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,320
will open for more uh

434
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,959
side channel uh possibilities right yes

435
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,560
that's totally right and this connection

436
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,279
is another very important problem in

437
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,279
real world crypto deployments which is

438
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,759
key revocation which is very

439
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,320
it's very hard to do it in practice so

440
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,560
my answer is the in the best

441
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,880
scenario would have like a key rotation

442
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,959
policy which may even change the crypt

443
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,079
algorithm together with a key revocation

444
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,079
mechanism that works uh

445
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,399
great so i think that's that's what we

446
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,639
need now in practice i can say that

447
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,440
revoking keys is a very hard task it's a

448
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,399
very hard thing to do in practice

449
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,679
okay

450
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,360
does that answer your question or

451
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,679
yes

452
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,559
if i if i understood raphael's correctly

453
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,439
the answer is it's complicated

454
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,360
yeah right thanks exactly

455
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,959
okay i guess we all agree with that

456
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,559
um

457
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,840
yes so we should kind of um try to to

458
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,400
follow up on the the most

459
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,799
interesting points from all tables so

460
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,760
maybe

461
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,000
move a bit to from

462
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,240
agility to um

463
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,760
post quantum

464
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,559
and the question i would like to ask

465
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,120
yeah maybe all of you is

466
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,760
if you see so far the next post quantum

467
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,799
standardization process success

468
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,200
and what did we learn from

469
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,760
that so far

470
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,799
maybe i can just emphasize once more

471
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,440
about the need of hybrid in

472
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,919
not only the need for deploying hybrid

473
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,919
schemes but also highlighting the the

474
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,880
complexities of deploying hybrid schemes

475
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,240
i think we mentioned briefly in the

476
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,360
previous panel um that cams i think it's

477
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,520
kind of very easy to do the hybrid you

478
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,919
just perform that you can and then you

479
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,960
just apply a kdf on the two secrets

480
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,720
but the thing for digital signatures is

481
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,760
something that i really want to

482
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,840
highlight that this would be

483
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,440
probably a mess

484
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,200
because we have so many options we have

485
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,640
the two

486
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,760
parallel certificates for example or one

487
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,000
signature over the other

488
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,679
i think

489
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,520
what i want to share here as a lesson

490
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,280
learned is that this problem looks like

491
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,679
a very complex problem in practice and

492
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,520
and i think the community needs to to

493
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,600
work together to hopefully quickly

494
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,120
convert to a single solution

495
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,000
[Music]

496
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,600
someone wants to

497
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,480
follow up on that

498
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,160
so i'll completely support everything

499
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
that raphael just said

500
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,720
um

501
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,559
layla i think your question was

502
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,200
has the process been a success so far

503
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,440
yes yes i think it's been an absolutely

504
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,559
unqualified success um look at the

505
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,640
research that has been stimulated by the

506
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,840
nispose quantum process alone right 70

507
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,080
plus submissions from around the world

508
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,720
uh the first major you know sort of

509
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,760
inter international um competition in

510
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,400
this field we got a whole bunch of good

511
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,679
candidates we

512
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,520
a whole bunch of ph phds got written on

513
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
and and research out of it and we're now

514
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,480
down to

515
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,559
you know a set of winners and a set of

516
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,919
finalists

517
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,679
and we are still stimulating absolutely

518
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,000
spectacular research results that

519
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,400
surprise us even within the last few

520
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,280
weeks right so how can you say you know

521
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,720
of course it was a success and i'm

522
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,240
thankful that um

523
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,000
that the u.s government basically

524
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,799
allocated funding for nist to carry this

525
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,159
out like they did for shot three and

526
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,480
like they did for aes because this is a

527
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,760
standard that we're going to be working

528
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,840
with for a while and i think the

529
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,600
community participation in this has been

530
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,080
a great thing um and that it's all being

531
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
done out in the open with everybody to

532
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,159
comment on

533
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,799
and you know now the next stage of that

534
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,880
work is now gonna come on even as this

535
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,960
finishes round four

536
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,400
and we've got to put the same amount of

537
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,919
effort into that

538
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,039
but yeah i think it's been an

539
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,280
unqualified success

540
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,039
so there is nothing that could be done

541
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,000
better you are saying

542
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,480
i wish psych was doing better but i mean

543
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,400
i'm not gonna you know

544
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,720
um

545
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,919
look i think you always have trade-offs

546
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,039
when you are trying to guess

547
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,960
on rules um

548
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,120
nist has to lay down a set of rules

549
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,039
early on and you're trying to predict a

550
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,240
certain sort of thing and

551
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,400
you know there were comments on on

552
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,840
choices that were made early on in the

553
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,120
competition i think they're basically

554
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,280
random you know as best they could

555
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,400
meeting the

556
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,080
requirements of the charter they were

557
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,120
given

558
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,919
um

559
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,320
you know

560
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,520
i

561
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,280
i'm not sure what more you would

562
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,440
actually look for

563
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,440
do you have some ideas in mind

564
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,919
i i as someone doesn't really understand

565
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,919
post quantum cryptography especially the

566
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,600
public key parts

567
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,360
i i

568
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,120
i think that we've seen the last few

569
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,360
rounds actually in the last few weeks

570
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,760
things which are not actually a huge

571
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,360
success i mean

572
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,840
besides the freedom of information acts

573
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,039
or

574
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,000
complaints running around

575
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
we see an issue with with

576
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,520
patents

577
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,080
something that in other competitions we

578
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,520
haven't seen

579
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,080
and i think that

580
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,919
to what to one said i i completely agree

581
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,000
that with what brian said in the sense

582
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,200
that it inspired new research amazing

583
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,280
really amazing research there was a huge

584
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,600
effort by everyone both from industry

585
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,360
and academia

586
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,440
there was a lot of involvement by every

587
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,679
all the players around the table

588
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,679
and you know we see we see now people

589
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,120
working on

590
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,720
some of the mathematical assumptions and

591
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,559
i think this you know there is a good

592
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,159
chance we're going to see again the

593
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,000
brains groups uh

594
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,600
massacre of

595
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,400
2002 or three or four i forgot

596
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,039
when the real massacre happened but

597
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,200
there was there was a series of if you

598
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,480
remember what happened with braids

599
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,360
groups

600
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,799
um

601
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,640
but on the other hand and i think this

602
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,720
is something that the competition or

603
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,400
nist had had to handle in a very

604
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,920
uh

605
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,640
[Music]

606
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,159
in a slightly different way you know

607
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,080
what i'm not sure i'm not sure i have a

608
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,440
solution for that it's the ip issues

609
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,080
and i i think this this is going to

610
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,880
impact the outcome and especially the

611
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,640
adoption

612
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,480
of the lightweight crypto competition

613
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,640
the first quantum crypto competition

614
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,960
winner

615
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,880
any comments on that

616
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,480
i mean i would also like to encourage

617
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,559
the audience i don't see the audience

618
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,280
there obviously but we have some people

619
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,919
uh in zoom that's what i see and i

620
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,520
assume some in the

621
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,440
in the room there as well so it would be

622
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,600
nice to get some

623
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:37,910
um

624
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,280
[Music]

625
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,960
comments yeah

626
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,559
while someone's coming up let me let me

627
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,480
just respond i'm not going to put nist

628
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,559
on the spot here okay but i'll respond

629
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,600
to or

630
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,480
certainly ipr issues are

631
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,720
signed of significant concern to anybody

632
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,000
in industry

633
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,039
and

634
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,039
we saw the adoption of ecc was delayed

635
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,760
significantly because of

636
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,320
ipr concerns whether they were justified

637
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,400
or not as neither here nor there

638
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,840
um

639
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,480
i will point out and i guess um

640
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,320
there are some choices nist could have

641
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,840
made a little bit differently when they

642
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,279
set the process up um the ipr rules

643
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,039
could have been a little bit tighter

644
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,799
um some of these were suggested in the

645
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,559
public comments from

646
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,400
from that i wrote for microsoft and for

647
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,640
others uh that'd be more like what

648
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,880
happened when they did shot three

649
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,159
we live in a different world now and

650
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,320
that's not what happened

651
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,559
that being said

652
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,440
in

653
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,159
our world as it lives today we cannot

654
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,240
fully eliminate

655
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,159
potential third-party ipr claims and

656
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,279
that's something that we all just live

657
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,720
with in industry

658
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,440
um no matter what you do you can't

659
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,760
you can't guarantee anything because you

660
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,120
don't have any relationship with people

661
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,440
who aren't party to the competition

662
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,320
and that's just a sad back to life

663
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,159
and it's one that we live with and we've

664
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,440
seen it come up time and again in an

665
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,559
industry

666
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,559
um

667
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,720
but maybe maybe we could do more the

668
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,720
next time this chooses to go run a

669
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,600
competition if they ever decide to do

670
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,159
another competition

671
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,640
i i i want to remind everyone during the

672
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,880
as competition there was a

673
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,200
some patent claims by

674
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,279
if i remember correctly it was a

675
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,360
korean company that claimed that they

676
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,440
had patented

677
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,679
fixed bit rotations

678
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,520
in cryptography

679
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,240
now the patent was

680
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,440
some of you

681
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,320
you

682
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,679
may think of this statement as

683
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,679
it's weird

684
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,679
especially given the fact that any block

685
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,640
ciphers that we know since i don't know

686
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,159
80 something are using fixed bit

687
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,440
rotations

688
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,640
um

689
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,880
but the pattern when the community went

690
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,720
against this pattern at some point i

691
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
remember nessie the european project

692
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,600
nessie

693
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,520
saying something issuing a statement

694
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,159
saying this this statement is bogus now

695
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,679
and then i think that in this case the

696
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,120
patent was not from some third party

697
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
completely uninvolved and outside our

698
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,919
community right someone very close and

699
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,120
then and i think that with third party

700
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,039
very distance patents yes of course we

701
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,400
can't handle that right if somebody

702
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,679
comes up

703
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,120
two years from now and say here i have a

704
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
patent for the white rail strategy and

705
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,799
it was issued in 98 or 96 or 95 it's

706
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,480
going to be very hard to do

707
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,720
to to counter that

708
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,360
but this patent was on the table from

709
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,240
day one so so i'm not sure that

710
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,799
i'm worried about the third party

711
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,200
liability i'm more worried about people

712
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,320
around us

713
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,039
liability

714
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,559
laila we have a question here

715
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,600
i was just wondering what

716
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,960
uh

717
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,760
what

718
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,799
we could have done different

719
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,279
with respect to those two patents that

720
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,720
we have to handle

721
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
i i just don't know what we could have

722
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,640
done

723
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,919
[Music]

724
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,159
i will i will point you to the comments

725
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,000
that we that i wrote and filed in 2016.

726
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,760
to the okay i mean you've asked right

727
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,200
so you know when the draft rules came

728
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,360
out and went out for comment

729
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,039
the ipr

730
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,600
rules were were in there they were both

731
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,678
royalty-free as well as rand

732
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,080
nist could have considered

733
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,919
a stronger

734
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,039
requirement on participants

735
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,120
okay and we can debate the pros and cons

736
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,440
of this but for example nist could have

737
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,279
said it's got to be royalty-free

738
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,640
this could have also said that if you

739
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,880
choose to participate in the competition

740
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,600
and you have any ip that reads on the

741
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,240
eventual winner not just your own

742
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,279
that you allow that to be used for free

743
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,880
as part of implementing the standard

744
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,600
that is that there would be a cost entry

745
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,360
now you have to

746
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,799
weigh

747
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,799
the benefit to the community of trying

748
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,559
to diffuse some of those claims to the

749
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,159
does that cause some people to not

750
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,520
participate

751
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,120
and you want everybody to participate so

752
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,840
i'm not saying that that's necessarily

753
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
guaranteed to be the right thing but

754
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,640
there are trade-offs in this right

755
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,720
um

756
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,279
you know the the fact is we all had to

757
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,520
sign certain declarations the question

758
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,039
is could you have done more you know

759
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,480
could you require

760
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,200
you know some

761
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,279
some

762
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,440
pre-ordained grant independent i don't

763
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,159
know and i am not an attorney

764
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,159
so you know i don't even play one on the

765
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,799
internet so

766
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,000
but that would be the sort of thing to

767
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,200
think about

768
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,960
and you know whether or not the lawyers

769
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,320
at various places would allow something

770
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,559
like that

771
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,480
can you repeat the question so i think

772
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,399
ryan's question is

773
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,679
not the original sin but is there

774
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,880
anything that could have been done sort

775
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,360
of while the competition was going on

776
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,440
to do that and frankly i am hesitant

777
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,240
to

778
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,039
step into the middle of this ongoing

779
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,760
negotiations or whatever is happening i

780
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,840
am cognizant of the footnote in the

781
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,240
round three report that says there are

782
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,919
things ongoing

783
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,320
i don't want to disrupt those well i'm

784
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,600
not sure how i could disrupt them but

785
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,640
the point is

786
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,480
you know that's

787
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,720
let's see how things come out right

788
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,480
i

789
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,919
i don't have a good solution for that

790
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,360
and i don't even know if there was a

791
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,640
solution that would work for the united

792
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,760
states will work for the rest of the

793
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,960
world because we want this to be a

794
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,320
worldwide standard

795
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,039
and ipr rights are something that are

796
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,799
country by country basis

797
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,200
so i don't know right um

798
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,919
i mean if the us government had an

799
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,840
infinite supply of money to throw around

800
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
to buy out patents proactively in

801
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,120
cryptography that might help fund more

802
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,039
crypto industries but you know that's

803
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,120
not the world we live in

804
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,799
so i don't i don't have an answer for

805
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,039
you i think you as best we can tell from

806
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,520
the outside i think you tried to do you

807
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,200
all tried to do what what you could when

808
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,360
you could but again we're not privy to

809
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,639
that process nor should we be

810
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,360
we have a comment allela from joanne

811
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,159
yes i i was gonna i was gonna close on

812
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,080
on this post quantum and then maybe move

813
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,799
to to to the lightweight standardization

814
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,039
so that relates to lightweight more i

815
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,159
think

816
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,880
no also yeah sorry post quantum actually

817
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,720
so maybe malcolm

818
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,679
that

819
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,399
can you read it

820
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,320
sure

821
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,519
yes maybe something you comment on yeah

822
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,240
johann's question is um many post

823
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,279
quantum

824
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,240
make use of one of the shakes so i think

825
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,039
this is to generate some randomness

826
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,720
uh shaking i cannot hear you

827
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,679
you don't hear me

828
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,159
is the sponge construction based on the

829
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,640
ketchup permutation that has originally

830
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,679
24 rounds and um

831
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,159
tips 202 defines ketchup permutation

832
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:40,880
with

833
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,279
other number of rounds i cannot hear you

834
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,279
again

835
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,919
i don't know what it is now now we can

836
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,360
okay

837
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,120
yeah the question is about um

838
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,080
approving uh shake

839
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,559
which is a based on ketchup permutation

840
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,880
with smaller number of rounds

841
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,000
and

842
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,559
i think yuan is proposing

843
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,000
nist to approve this as a

844
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,600
new

845
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,840
hash function

846
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,360
a pseudorandom function

847
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,519
i'm not sure what the

848
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,200
exact question is

849
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,320
but yes uh i think post quantum

850
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,120
algorithms make use of a shake to

851
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,600
generate randomness but yawn is here

852
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
maybe he also

853
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,959
wants to clarify

854
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,600
yes so the point is that

855
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,360
in many post-quantum schemes

856
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,919
shake is one of the slowest components

857
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,919
but it has twice the number of rounds

858
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,080
that it should have so if you look at

859
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,760
aes there are attacks on aes for six

860
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,360
seven rounds

861
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,039
for uh shake there are attacks for up to

862
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,200
six to nine rounds

863
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,240
uh so this 24 rounds is a

864
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,360
huge

865
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,720
overshoot

866
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,600
so

867
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,919
why isn't there a discussion to reduce

868
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,880
the number of rounds or at least

869
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,640
think about it and there's completely

870
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,679
silence about that

871
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,959
did you follow milton yeah

872
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,000
i mean shake is already part of the

873
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,200
standard right so it's uh

874
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,080
whether

875
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,960
mis is it a good idea for this to have

876
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,120
another variant with smaller number of

877
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,080
rounds especially among these all these

878
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,159
trust issues i don't know i don't know

879
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,919
how it would be

880
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,080
uh

881
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,120
you know

882
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
how would the academic community other

883
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,840
communities would respond to that uh but

884
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,320
technically i think i would also be very

885
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,760
comfortable with 12 num 12 rounds for

886
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,000
shake as well but

887
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,480
at this point it's not my call to make

888
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,080
or approve any algorithms

889
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,679
okay

890
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,599
or if if i may suggest that having

891
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,760
reducing only one of the standards to 12

892
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,199
is going to be kind of weird and then

893
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,879
you're going to have

894
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,560
if you're going to use shake in anything

895
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,239
which is not post quantum you should use

896
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,079
24 ounce if you're using shake for

897
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,359
something which is post quantum you

898
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,040
should use 12 rounds

899
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,079
and if you're going to do

900
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,520
implementations in libraries you're

901
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,040
going to have to implement it correctly

902
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,760
to support both 12 trumps and 24 amps

903
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,359
and now the complexity of implementation

904
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,760
has grown a bit if you're doing harder

905
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,359
that's going to be a complete mess if

906
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,359
you're going going to the software

907
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,918
you're going to have various issues and

908
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,159
that follow i'm not sure that we tested

909
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,440
or checked

910
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,480
um

911
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,760
how

912
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
such primitives handle the fact that the

913
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,239
number of rounds change i mean you may

914
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,320
get into slide attacks or some

915
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,599
something

916
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,400
no

917
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
we took it into account when designing

918
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,960
with the round nonsense so

919
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,880
no in the sense that suddenly okay so

920
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,320
not necessarily just slide the text but

921
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,400
suddenly you have related the schemes

922
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,720
attacks so think for example of a cipher

923
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,280
that can be producing output after think

924
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,720
of even a yes

925
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,320
the same key and everything you can

926
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,280
produce as128 with 10 10 rounds or 11

927
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,200
rounds and suddenly supporting both of

928
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
these operations i can ensure that

929
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,160
there's going to be at least one

930
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,839
implementation that would allow you to

931
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,359
see the encryption after 10 rounds and

932
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,440
the encryption after 11 rounds under the

933
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,200
same key and then suddenly if you look

934
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,240
at the difference between the two

935
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
ciphertexts there is only one round

936
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,800
difference so i'm not sure that this

937
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
sort of analysis has been done

938
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,640
even though you say oh the distance is

939
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,560
still going to be 12 rounds

940
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,119
i would be very cautious of

941
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,200
it

942
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,560
and

943
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,200
besides you

944
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,520
beyond are there under other

945
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,880
groups or

946
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,320
people who worked on this problem

947
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,400
so my point is holding both

948
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,839
two different types of standards using

949
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,280
the same primitive is going to cause the

950
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,359
headache both for implementation wise

951
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,839
and security wise if you want to say you

952
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:18,720
have

953
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,480
worked on that and and you're assured

954
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,320
that's great we would like to see other

955
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,480
groups validating this claim

956
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,800
but there is a problem here that

957
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,400
personally i i would

958
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,680
and and i think this is something that

959
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,640
came out

960
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,800
actually from the from the post tracking

961
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,359
crypto suddenly somebody introduces a

962
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,359
new assumption and then oh it looks

963
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,119
reasonable and then suddenly just a few

964
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,000
days after the competition ends

965
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,280
um

966
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,800
there's a problem with the hardness

967
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,480
assumption so so i would be very

968
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,560
cautious and i think that

969
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,839
if this

970
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,079
did something which was very good during

971
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,640
the post quantum crypto is like being

972
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,480
very conservative with the hardness

973
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,000
assumption

974
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,520
we we want our standards to be

975
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,320
in that aspect conservative

976
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,280
instead of me just yelling so loud that

977
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,320
like joan and orr can hear me

978
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,920
okay um

979
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,920
one thing i was going to point out

980
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,240
um

981
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,680
when i think you want made a comment

982
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,800
about well there's just been silence

983
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,040
from nist about reducing shake to 12

984
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,000
rounds

985
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,400
um there's a real bandwidth

986
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,560
problem here as far as how much stuff we

987
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,480
can work on at once

988
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,760
so a proposal to redefine shake to a

989
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,200
smaller number of rounds isn't something

990
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
we would do just by saying oh okay well

991
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,440
john says it's okay let's do it

992
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,800
um it would be something we would have

993
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,240
to go through and spend a fair bit of

994
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,160
time making sure was okay and doing some

995
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,839
of the stuff or was talking about about

996
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,079
looking around for analysis

997
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,640
um so it wouldn't be something trivial

998
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,000
and i'd say this is somebody with

999
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,160
absolutely no power right like i can't

1000
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
make anything happen at nist i'm just a

1001
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,359
cryptographer

1002
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,359
but i can tell you it's not so easy for

1003
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,359
us to just jump into yet another project

1004
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,040
or doing a major thing if we were going

1005
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,800
to do that that would have to be a

1006
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,400
separate project we would do that would

1007
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,960
take some time um so it wouldn't just be

1008
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,040
a quick okay well let's just flip it to

1009
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,800
12 rounds

1010
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,560
um the other thing that orr said about

1011
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,720
having the problem of the two different

1012
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,440
versions that were very similar i think

1013
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,280
there's an i think you could resolve

1014
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,040
that if i'm remembering right yawn is

1015
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,119
here so he can say something um but

1016
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,520
there are domain domain separation bits

1017
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,760
in the padding i think you can use that

1018
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,079
to get distinct instances so i think

1019
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,680
that would actually resolve that prompts

1020
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,119
you wouldn't be getting

1021
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,560
exactly the

1022
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,320
the state after six rounds and then this

1023
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,920
or the state after 12 rounds and then

1024
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,599
also the state after 24 rounds and be

1025
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,400
able to do some weirdness between yeah

1026
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,960
so that's just my that's just my quick

1027
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,160
comment

1028
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,800
but um yeah it's of course it's not this

1029
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
uh domain separation is for different

1030
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,560
capacity values it's not for different

1031
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,320
number of rounds

1032
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,880
um we try to address the different

1033
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,119
number of rounds with the the round

1034
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,240
constants

1035
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,320
but i agree that having multiple

1036
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,960
versions in parallel with the same keys

1037
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,520
that's a danger but um

1038
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,359
uh a priory shake is used without a key

1039
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,119
so um

1040
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,640
yeah there's no

1041
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,400
how could i say there's no

1042
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,800
[Music]

1043
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,359
infection of one to the other as soon as

1044
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,440
you start using this different function

1045
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,640
functions with different number of

1046
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,800
rounds with the same key then you're

1047
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,520
really yeah then you have a risk

1048
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,760
although i think it's mitigated but i

1049
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,599
would never recommend doing that so if

1050
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,560
you use

1051
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,320
different algorithms with the same key

1052
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,680
that's really a no go

1053
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,839
at least i think it would be good to

1054
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:57,520
have at least a discussion about it but

1055
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,200
there's complete silence about it and

1056
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,319
that's what i don't like

1057
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,920
just to clarify uh johan you say sleep

1058
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,480
vips 202 defines sketchup with other

1059
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,000
number of rounds

1060
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,440
so this is the

1061
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,760
the number of rounds is determined by

1062
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,480
the size of the uh permutation right

1063
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,079
it's not the

1064
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,680
fairly

1065
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,119
number of rounds

1066
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,480
yeah so um in the standards

1067
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,640
the ketchup permutations are defined for

1068
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
any number of rounds but it's not

1069
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,280
endorsed so you have all these different

1070
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,720
size versions right catch up f

1071
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,079
25 up to 1600 but only ketchup have 1600

1072
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,720
with 24 rounds is endorsed in the

1073
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,720
standard but all the other uh

1074
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,000
ketchup f versions are defined and the

1075
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,760
ketchup f versions with a different

1076
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,839
number of rounds we call them ketchup p

1077
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,920
and the number of rounds is a parameter

1078
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,880
correct but they are not used approved

1079
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,359
for any use

1080
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,800
the only one that is approved is

1081
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,839
actually ketchup f

1082
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,560
1600 yeah

1083
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,880
later

1084
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,640
nope

1085
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,040
so um maybe we can move on i think this

1086
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,960
is uh yeah

1087
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,880
and conclude this this this has been

1088
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,760
quite discussed uh this point so maybe

1089
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,040
we wanna also discuss a bit on lessons

1090
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,440
learned from the um lightweight

1091
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,560
standardization again maybe pointing at

1092
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,839
welcome

1093
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,560
with the standardization um lessons

1094
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,720
learned issue so maybe a question for me

1095
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,280
and then also the same question for for

1096
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,839
our panelists like um do you think it

1097
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,040
was a success overall and my question to

1098
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,760
malcolm is i i think you said in the

1099
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,960
previous

1100
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,920
table that you did yeah you missed

1101
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,839
aiming at one

1102
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,800
one finalist one standalone and and then

1103
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,599
speaking of one lightweight standard and

1104
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,119
also some of

1105
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,680
issues were brought up like with respect

1106
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,319
to which property you see it lightweight

1107
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,800
it like as lightweight in which use case

1108
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,280
does it mean that you have like one

1109
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,079
definition for lightweight and and if so

1110
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,079
which would that be so like in which

1111
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,520
specific use case you would then go for

1112
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,720
lightweight in that in that sense

1113
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,599
yeah so it is

1114
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,680
well there's no one definition for

1115
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,160
lightweight right so we have uh hardware

1116
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,079
applications we are we have we have

1117
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,839
software applications and we have

1118
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,440
different metrics

1119
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,760
uh for each of these applications we

1120
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,640
could look at area or power consumption

1121
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,960
latency or code size

1122
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,440
and we've

1123
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,200
based on it based on the benchmark

1124
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,880
results uh

1125
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,880
we are also you know benchmarking the

1126
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,160
finals and also the aes gcm and also

1127
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,079
shelter in this

1128
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,040
in these comparisons so then we want to

1129
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,480
see where aes is so if if the algorithms

1130
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,119
do not perform do not bring

1131
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,839
significant performance advantage over

1132
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:26,960
aes

1133
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,200
then that's there's no point like at

1134
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,240
least 50 percent or 200 percent uh

1135
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,800
improvement we are expecting and we see

1136
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,920
that uh aes is doing well in

1137
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,520
microcontrollers and software

1138
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,760
application part which is kind of what

1139
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,920
we expected in the beginning

1140
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,960
and we see that there is improvement in

1141
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,640
the hardware uh in terms of area latency

1142
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,920
um

1143
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,040
in the hardware application so uh we are

1144
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,119
going to focus more on

1145
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,520
the parts where aes is not performing

1146
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,760
well but we also get we are also

1147
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,480
expecting some results for the protected

1148
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,359
implementations which we don't have yet

1149
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,599
and once we have those results as well

1150
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,599
we will

1151
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,680
see

1152
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,560
which algorithm provides more benefit

1153
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,440
compared to a yes

1154
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,880
yes but since you mentioned several

1155
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,640
things there will not be one single

1156
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,240
candidate that meets all those

1157
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,560
requirements so it will be a sort of

1158
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,640
a bit of like you know

1159
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,319
trade-offs like

1160
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,800
that much better when protected that

1161
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,560
much but

1162
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,880
not so great in hardware so it's not

1163
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,359
going to be easy decision i assume right

1164
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,119
that is correct it's not going to be a

1165
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,640
trivial decision

1166
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,599
uh but at the same time we are aware of

1167
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,839
that you know maintaining standards are

1168
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:48,839
hard

1169
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,480
and

1170
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,079
different

1171
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,480
you know so that's why we want to have a

1172
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,960
simplest solution that might cover most

1173
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
of the area that you know

1174
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,520
that might answer most of the

1175
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,359
need

1176
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,640
from the industry hopefully

1177
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,560
okay i see

1178
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,680
we have a question here in the audience

1179
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,960
yes great

1180
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,880
okay this question

1181
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,960
is mostly related to the agility

1182
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,520
the next uh finalist we have like a lot

1183
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,839
of primitives and there is varieties

1184
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,880
we see

1185
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,440
uh stream cipher based algorithm also

1186
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,560
there is a

1187
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,920
i think there is one tutorial block

1188
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,280
cipher and we have permutation based so

1189
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,000
in terms of agility which

1190
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,079
which one of them do you think is better

1191
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,560
in terms of cost

1192
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,280
so

1193
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,839
none of them will be a drop of drop-in

1194
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,720
replacement for aes so i i actually

1195
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,800
don't know which algorithms would be

1196
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,200
harder to switch

1197
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,040
in terms of

1198
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,359
underlying primitives

1199
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,599
but maybe i mean thinking about for

1200
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,240
example grain uh is one of the streams

1201
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,920
is the only stream cipher in the uh

1202
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,440
finalists and

1203
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,440
it kind of fits

1204
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,480
it kind of it is harder to make it fit

1205
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,640
to the api that we currently have and

1206
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,119
there are some challenges maybe going

1207
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,880
with the stream cipher design would be

1208
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,880
more challenging but

1209
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,359
in terms of agility i i honestly don't

1210
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,598
know

1211
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,240
if or you have a better answer

1212
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,079
i i i think

1213
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,920
you know if you think about the sponge

1214
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,319
function then you just abstract away the

1215
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,839
the permutation

1216
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:44,880
may offer

1217
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,119
nicer agility to some extent

1218
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,720
and the same goes with a block cipher

1219
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,319
you can just plug in another block

1220
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,720
cipher because the mod mod surrounding i

1221
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,880
think this is something that missed done

1222
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,040
here the lightweight crypto competition

1223
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,200
unlike the as competition it was one

1224
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,960
competition for a block cipher and then

1225
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,480
a different competition

1226
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,359
but i think nobody remembers anymore

1227
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:06,880
about the mods

1228
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,640
of operation they're

1229
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,560
they're completely separated

1230
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,599
here in the lightweight crypto

1231
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,839
competition they're actually

1232
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,319
tied together you have to specify the

1233
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,440
full a aead scheme

1234
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,480
um

1235
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,640
in that aspects i think that the agility

1236
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,800
is going to be very difficult to switch

1237
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,319
from one

1238
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,640
mode to another so if you picked

1239
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,400
permutation base or a block cipher base

1240
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,319
or a stream cipher based it's going to

1241
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,240
be very hard to switch to something else

1242
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,160
of course in software maybe rafael knows

1243
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,760
better i think hardware is going to be a

1244
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,800
complete

1245
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,200
hell to to handle that

1246
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,119
especially as the api the interfaces

1247
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,800
have got what's going in what's going

1248
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,240
going out is going to be completely

1249
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,280
different

1250
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,559
um

1251
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,720
so i'm sure i'm i'm not sure it's going

1252
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,319
to

1253
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,280
uh to be good but again maybe rafael

1254
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,920
from software's point of view and apis

1255
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,800
you know better so

1256
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,200
yeah i think my answer is that it's very

1257
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,118
complex as i previously experienced

1258
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,599
some uh something related to the similar

1259
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,359
question question to

1260
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,520
this pqc algorithms

1261
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,599
so we also have diversity there code

1262
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,079
based and lattice based so a similar

1263
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,480
question

1264
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,280
sorry can you repeat that again i mean

1265
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,079
like in terms of agility which which you

1266
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,359
consider as like good in terms of cost

1267
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,240
in terms of cost

1268
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,800
well look i mean

1269
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,200
i mean

1270
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,040
are you trying to ask which one might be

1271
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,559
easier or more difficult to support

1272
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,920
agility in

1273
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,839
okay so then what you really got to look

1274
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,000
at are the parameter sizes for

1275
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,440
the algorithms you're looking at and

1276
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,359
you know let's let's take

1277
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,359
um

1278
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,599
so this goes back to designing an api

1279
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,920
that basically can take

1280
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,040
different size public keys private keys

1281
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,680
cipher text signatures things like that

1282
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,480
i think where i worry most right now

1283
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,640
from an agility perspective is not about

1284
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,160
any of the individual particular

1285
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,280
candidates

1286
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,319
but the general fact that all

1287
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,480
all the post-quantum algorithms that

1288
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,280
we're looking at

1289
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,480
exceed the sizes of

1290
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,520
rsa and ecc in at least one dimension

1291
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,440
where you look at the dimension of

1292
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,920
public key or ciphertext or signature

1293
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,800
so the things i worry about are where in

1294
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,680
a code base that maybe was designed

1295
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,079
15 year and written 15 years ago when

1296
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,079
that was all we cared about

1297
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,640
that we might have implicit limits in

1298
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,640
the code base that we're going to run

1299
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,960
into when we try to migrate this is one

1300
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,319
of the reasons i've been pushing teams

1301
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,480
internally to start testing with much

1302
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,400
larger certificates because i don't want

1303
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,920
to run into a part in the code base

1304
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,880
where

1305
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,280
you know well nobody's ever going to

1306
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,920
need more than 16 kilobits to hold a key

1307
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,920
because that's the largest rsa key that

1308
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,559
we even support in the api so let's just

1309
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,319
put a hard-coded limit in that that's

1310
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:17,599
the key size and all of a sudden we're

1311
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,760
not talking about much larger public

1312
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,839
keys than 16 kilobits

1313
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:22,960
um

1314
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,480
so i was heartened by the fact that we

1315
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,559
were actually able to run

1316
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,960
in the example where we used to pick um

1317
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,640
round one picnic signatures and

1318
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,240
certificates and we could run 33

1319
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,400
kilobyte signatures on x 509

1320
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,480
certificates through the open ssl stacks

1321
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,240
that we modeled

1322
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,240
so that that's a real concern and that's

1323
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,480
an engineering concern

1324
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,559
and it's not malicious it's just that

1325
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,240
there were engineering assumptions that

1326
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,119
were made when some of these even the

1327
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:49,920
most

1328
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,599
our best attempts at making

1329
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,400
cryptographically agile apis um

1330
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,559
i mean if you look at windows

1331
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,160
our first cryptographic agile api was

1332
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,760
crypto api 1.0 and that shipped in the

1333
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,960
mid 90s

1334
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,920
and it was agile it was agile for rsa

1335
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,520
and it was agile for dsa and it was

1336
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,599
added for diffie-hellman because the use

1337
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,760
cases for agility were hardware

1338
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,119
implementations of those as opposed to

1339
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,520
the microsoft software ones

1340
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,920
ecc required we put a whole new api in

1341
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,920
that's why you have cng

1342
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,440
i don't think we have to do a new one

1343
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,040
for post quantum

1344
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,800
but i worry about other parts of the

1345
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,160
software stack where there are the

1346
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,240
implicit limits and and i think

1347
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,680
everybody should kind of go look at that

1348
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,680
so that's that's the cost i care about

1349
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,839
okay

1350
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,480
but wouldn't some of these problems also

1351
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,960
be existing in a protocol level right if

1352
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,000
you suddenly cross the size of the tcp

1353
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,280
packet window like 64k

1354
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,960
you're going to get into travel from the

1355
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,800
network layer not not even before it

1356
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,599
reaches your computer

1357
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:55,040
so have we contacted the tcp ietf task

1358
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,880
force to tell them hey you need to

1359
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,280
update tcp to support

1360
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,000
post quantum crypto

1361
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,240
i believe that's part of the reason why

1362
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,200
falcon was considered a signature a

1363
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,520
candidate right was exactly some of the

1364
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,119
i guess the individual packet size

1365
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,079
lengths and and yes or i suspect we're

1366
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,920
going to find all sorts of interesting

1367
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,839
problems in some of those

1368
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,160
those protocols as we do test

1369
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,520
deployments

1370
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,359
and uh

1371
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,280
we will continue to live in interesting

1372
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,280
times is what i suspect is going to

1373
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,280
happen

1374
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,559
okay

1375
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,079
thanks

1376
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,920
francisco any more questions from the

1377
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,359
audience

1378
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:48,240
uh

1379
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,079
not right now

1380
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,000
no but it's also maybe

1381
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
almost closing time

1382
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,880
um

1383
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,960
maybe a good um

1384
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,760
point to to ask a question to to this

1385
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,240
table also about the

1386
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,160
uh kind of your

1387
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,040
overall opinion on this initiative to

1388
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,680
organize a workshop like this so do you

1389
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,240
see this

1390
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,480
ghdc becoming a serious and

1391
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,319
the question is more like are we gonna

1392
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,280
need another one of these workshops in a

1393
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,040
year or so or

1394
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,280
what do you think are we are all our

1395
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,040
problems with agility be sold by them

1396
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,720
so i think you're going to need one in a

1397
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,040
year and what i hope it is is that we

1398
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,319
actually see

1399
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,400
some research papers

1400
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,960
on cryptographic agility um i think it

1401
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,119
was kenny patterson and

1402
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,680
david uh david vmware

1403
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,920
had the paper on uh where's the research

1404
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,319
on crypto agility and that's a really

1405
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,160
fair question because

1406
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:52,960
like

1407
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,599
this is clearly a hard problem that has

1408
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,400
been you know that has bedeviled us for

1409
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,880
decades and yet i don't know of a lot of

1410
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,520
actual research on

1411
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,079
how to design cryptographically agile

1412
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,599
systems and make sure that agility is

1413
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,280
respected as part of a software

1414
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,960
development process

1415
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,280
and i think that's a great research

1416
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,800
question and we're going to need more of

1417
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,599
it

1418
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,359
as we're also in the middle of rolling

1419
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,559
out more agile systems so i think

1420
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,319
there's some good systems research to be

1421
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,880
done there and maybe that could be the

1422
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,359
focus of a future workshop

1423
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,359
that would be my thought

1424
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,119
yeah i'll just say that actually crypto

1425
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,839
agile is a topic that it's a it's a

1426
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,240
topic by itself it really deserves for

1427
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,119
example its own crypto conference its

1428
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,240
own workshop so i think there is a

1429
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,839
there's a lot of work to be done there

1430
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,160
in kind of for example systematizing

1431
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,680
what we need from a crypto agile

1432
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,920
perspective creating generic frameworks

1433
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,680
i think it's really a topic by itself

1434
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,760
it's not only like something we apply

1435
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,559
here or there it's a it's a whole new

1436
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,760
science if we can say

1437
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:03,359
yeah i want to echo

1438
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,599
the two previous panelists

1439
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,359
and i would suggest

1440
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,440
just to start with we don't know how to

1441
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,839
do standards correctly in cryptography

1442
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,359
let alone doing

1443
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:15,520
standards that support cryptology and

1444
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,200
there is a conference which is dedicated

1445
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,880
for standards ssr

1446
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,119
civilization something in

1447
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,160
something

1448
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:22,630
um

1449
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:23,760
[Music]

1450
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,359
it has been running for a while we still

1451
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:26,640
haven't solved all the problems of

1452
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,480
synthesization

1453
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,160
i guess that crypto agility is the next

1454
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,559
target for a new series of conferences

1455
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,200
and actual seminars and the

1456
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,280
meetings so

1457
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,359
francesca you're invited to start a

1458
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,520
doctoral seminar on that i'm sure that

1459
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,119
some people are are going to be

1460
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:45,760
interested in going there for that

1461
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,440
and i would be very happy to see it next

1462
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,440
time you know either europe actually if

1463
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,200
it's something which is global maybe not

1464
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,040
attaching it to crypto but

1465
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,960
switching between conferences would be a

1466
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,520
nice idea

1467
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,640
nice

1468
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,280
we got the question here in the audience

1469
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,040
yeah i was just gonna ask

1470
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,680
um just point out when we talk about

1471
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,880
agility

1472
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,160
we actually mean a whole bunch of

1473
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,599
different things right one meaning is

1474
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,280
when something's broken i can turn it

1475
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,640
off and

1476
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,760
tls still still gives me the lock icon

1477
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,720
and

1478
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,000
at a completely different level it's

1479
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,520
stuff like well when we roll out a whole

1480
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,040
new crypto system we don't have to

1481
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,720
rebuild the whole code base or we don't

1482
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,720
have to read it and that winds up

1483
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,119
touching not just whatever crypto code

1484
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,960
there is but all the networking stuff

1485
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,680
and

1486
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,599
the bigger protocol design

1487
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,440
it's a it's a big problem and part of it

1488
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,880
is even defining where you're where

1489
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,240
you're gonna

1490
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,319
kind of what you mean by the by crypto

1491
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,559
agility i feel like that's a place that

1492
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,160
is maybe a good place to start when

1493
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,240
you're thinking about doing this

1494
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,599
this work

1495
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,000
and john i'll just add to that there's a

1496
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,240
really big policy

1497
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,880
issue in terms of configuration policy

1498
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,960
right because we i think those of us who

1499
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,720
tend to write cryptographic libraries

1500
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,359
focus on the agility at the core api

1501
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,319
layer

1502
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,480
but if you are administering an

1503
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,119
enterprise and you are trying to use

1504
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,960
like oh my god i just saw this paper

1505
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,559
that tells me i can't use this algorithm

1506
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,040
anymore and you're trying to reconfigure

1507
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,960
your cryptography policy across your

1508
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,640
enterprise

1509
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,799
that is not an easy thing to do right

1510
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,960
now to even turn it off

1511
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,799
to turn it off may require that you

1512
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:27,359
understand 17 million different config

1513
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,359
settings all over the place

1514
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,160
and

1515
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,079
you know that percolation from the top

1516
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:35,359
level enterprise policy down to

1517
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,040
the low-level api

1518
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,040
that that's not there

1519
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,880
so you're right it's there's a lot of

1520
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,599
pieces to this

1521
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,680
okay thanks

1522
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,799
i guess it's time to grab up francisco

1523
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:57,359
yeah um may i ask just one remark um

1524
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,440
about lessons learned uh during the

1525
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,520
morning we were saying in the two first

1526
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,799
rounds that

1527
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:04,880
uh it is danger it's always dangerous to

1528
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,720
make predictions especially

1529
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,680
about the future but can we say that the

1530
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,160
future is post quantum

1531
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,160
is irreversible

1532
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,559
are we are we oh yeah

1533
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,000
it's like i don't think there's a

1534
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
question about that okay so it's a

1535
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,640
prediction yeah it will be post quantum

1536
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,480
uh like i said earlier i believe it will

1537
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,079
be hybrid for at least the rest of the

1538
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:27,119
decade

1539
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:28,000
um

1540
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,119
i will not make predictions about when

1541
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,680
you will routinely be able to make a tls

1542
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,720
1.3 connection using a hybrid classical

1543
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,760
plus pq scheme across the internet but

1544
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,760
i think that's the first

1545
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,599
major implementation

1546
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,200
but we're going to see rollouts over the

1547
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,119
rest of the decade right as things go um

1548
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,520
and you know

1549
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,359
hopefully we've got enough lead time on

1550
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:54,720
when that cryptographically relevant

1551
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,559
quantum computer ever shows up that

1552
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,480
we're we're going to be okay

1553
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,160
and i think we do

1554
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,359
well yeah okay thank you

1555
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,040
okay

1556
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,240
so maybe it's time to to close this uh

1557
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,480
first edition of the ghtc uh workshop we

1558
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,640
would like to thank all

1559
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,040
of our distinguished panelists and

1560
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,119
moderators and on behalf of the

1561
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,839
organizers we thank you for being here

1562
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:24,799
and we look forward to be again

1563
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,690
in 2023 for the second edition thank you

1564
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,860
[Music]

1565
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,839
special thanks to all that didn't go to

1566
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:37,040
bed as i recommend it

1567
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,319
he changed his background though

1568
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:46,200
yeah it's 1 30 here wow

1569
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,200
bye
