1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,560
okay uh welcome everyone again uh

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,200
we are about to start our second session

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,960
our second table that is going to be

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,120
shared by professor mike scott and we

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,000
have again a distinguished uh panelist

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,320
uh so mike place the floor is yours

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,840
right thanks francisco okay this is uh

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,920
the the second session uh on uh agility

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,359
uh just to set the scene a little bit

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,160
uh i have this had this analogy in mind

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,199
about

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,120
i think of the whole post quantum thing

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,120
and what we're trying to achieve here i

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,120
have this analogy in mind about this

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,920
asteroid called quantum computing right

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,320
and then we have planet crypto over here

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,960
and the asteroid is heading inexorably

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,079
towards planet krypton and uh we know

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,520
it's going to do a lot of damage when it

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,280
hits we know it's going to wipe out a

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,000
lot of the crypto uh life

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,320
uh and uh we're in a position where we

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,000
need to do something about it right we

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,239
need to be agile we're not just going to

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,920
sit there and be mesmerized and say oh

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,159
my god where we're going to actually

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,119
uh adapt and that that's what we need to

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,560
do it's also i think important to

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,360
emphasize the seriousness of the issue

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,840
right cryptography is actually very

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,159
important

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,479
if for example the security of tls were

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,720
to be wiped out overnight the impact on

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
the global economy is really quite

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,479
terrifying i think it would dwarf

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,119
anything we've seen recently so

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,119
there's a big responsibility resting on

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,360
all of our shoulders that uh that we

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,280
sort this that we fix this that we adapt

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,560
so we adapt cleverly agilely cleverly

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
and when we

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,079
we get things back to a nice stable

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,920
secure state that we can all be

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
confident in uh one thing before i want

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,840
to start the session i want to say is

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,759
that i very much we very much encourage

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,759
questions from the audience and indeed

48
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,320
from people who are attending online

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
right there's a lot of potentially

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,320
fraught controversial issues around this

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,159
subject and uh

52
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,399
i mean it'd be great to have a voice put

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,479
to them i'm going to ask some questions

54
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,079
but obviously some questions i might

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,280
have thought oh that might be great

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,439
questions or maybe you guys have so by

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,360
all means if you have a question either

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,640
here in the room or online uh

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,120
we will open it up at uh when we get

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,599
around about the halfway stage

61
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,840
okay now next thing is to introduce the

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,800
panel uh we have uh brian lamancia from

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,520
microsoft we have raphael

64
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,160
from uh who works for google uh and then

65
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,480
remotely we have edlyn teske

66
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,200
uh who works for cryptomatic in in

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,000
germany i believe uh and then finally

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,760
michael osborne from ibm and he's

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,440
attending from zurich hello michael

70
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,040
hello edward

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,160
uh so i initially like the last session

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,040
i i

73
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
asked you all just take a minute each to

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,080
introduce yourselves i mean i could

75
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,760
attempt to introduce you but i probably

76
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
wouldn't do you justice so

77
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,760
i let you do the introductions yourself

78
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,680
so perhaps start with yourself right

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,080
sure hi everyone i'm brian lamocchia i'm

80
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,560
a distinguished engineer at microsoft

81
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,159
and i lead the security and cryptography

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,720
team at microsoft research in redmond

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,120
uh we were co-submitters on four

84
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,599
proposals to the nist post quantum

85
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,680
uh including uh

86
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,040
q tesla frodo uh picnic and psych

87
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,720
it's been an interesting last few weeks

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,480
for us with psych

89
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,640
um i also happen to be treasurer of the

90
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
iacr if that's not a hat i'm wearing at

91
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,080
this event but when you catch me

92
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,159
tomorrow and afterwards you can also hit

93
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,319
me above that stuff too

94
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,720
okay hello everyone i'm rafi i'm a

95
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,040
cryptographer at google i'm working on

96
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,400
the pqc

97
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,799
transition for the company i'm involved

98
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,640
in two submissions that are now running

99
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,480
in the fourth round of the niche pkc

100
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,440
competition bike and classic mechanism

101
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,560
i'm also involved in some

102
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,040
standardization process with iso which

103
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,920
is the document 1488-4

104
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,400
on stateful hash-based signatures

105
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,799
and i've been working on the pqc

106
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,200
field since 2009 so it's very nice to

107
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,760
see finally it's prime time and to see

108
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,560
all this interest thank you

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,040
adeline

110
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,760
yes i'm ed lindesky i'm now with

111
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,400
cryptomatic working from the german

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,560
office i am there a senior crypto expert

113
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,120
supporting cryptomatic in

114
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,918
helping our customers becoming crypto

115
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,479
agile and um

116
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,560
fans of other threats

117
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,199
i have a background in research on the

118
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,120
mathematics of public key cryptography

119
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,639
for my 15 plus years at waterloo

120
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,040
so this topic is still very much at my

121
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,280
heart

122
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,520
thank you and michael

123
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,360
hi everybody sorry that i can't be there

124
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,400
in person

125
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,960
my name is mike osborne i work for ibm

126
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,919
research as a principal uh research

127
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,040
member

128
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,680
um here i'm responsible for the

129
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,919
foundational team where i really am very

130
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,360
privileged to work with the likes of

131
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,320
luca and vadim and gregor involved in a

132
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
number of schemes

133
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,800
i'm also responsible for

134
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,479
implementation of algorithms and

135
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,039
deploying these across various ibm

136
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,639
platforms

137
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,080
so this includes hardware security

138
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,600
module work and you may have received a

139
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,960
recent um

140
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,759
quantum safe mainframe announcement and

141
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,000
more recently i've just become cto of a

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,160
new organization that we formed called

143
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,479
quantum safe this is co-located with our

144
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,880
quantum efforts and this is the the part

145
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,639
which is really focused on

146
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,400
the migration of and services to uh to

147
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,880
help plants migrate or start their

148
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,840
quantum safe journey

149
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,000
great thanks michael yeah

150
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
a big issue i think for this roundtable

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,280
will be uh

152
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
for you get you guys to talk about

153
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,720
migration strategies and exactly the in

154
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,800
fine detail exactly what your intentions

155
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,280
are and what your plans are because

156
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,400
obviously that that that's a key issue

157
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,759
uh okay and let me get back uh

158
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,120
first of all i think we need a good

159
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,840
definition of crypto agility and i i

160
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,800
have one here from i have two two uh

161
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,639
definitions i managed to find from our

162
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,479
contributors here first one is from

163
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,639
adeline i think i'm hoping quoting you

164
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,720
correctly crypto agility or

165
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
cryptographic agility is the capacity

166
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
for an information security system to

167
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
adopt an alternative to the original

168
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,160
encryption method or cryptographic

169
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,000
primitive without significant change to

170
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,240
system infrastructure i think that's a

171
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,960
pretty a pretty good definition i have

172
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,720
another definition i think it comes from

173
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,759
you brian crypto agility the ability to

174
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,120
turn something off

175
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,639
which is uh short pithy and uh

176
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,120
i think quite good as well so

177
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,919
so

178
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,720
let me get back first to to edlin

179
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,240
you guys have something called the

180
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,560
cryptomatic crypto service gateway which

181
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,639
is designed to provide the crypto

182
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,440
agility that we need perhaps you could

183
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,039
give us a brief description of that

184
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,160
sure um

185
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,280
first off

186
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,680
saying that crypto agility this is not

187
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
new as a requirement

188
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,400
um so that's why we have the crypto

189
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,319
service gateway already in place and in

190
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,599
our offering

191
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,919
because um cryptographic algorithms will

192
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,160
have have been replaced over time in the

193
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,599
past as well

194
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,360
so the

195
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,440
cryptoservice gateway allows that

196
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,880
one has an abstraction layer between the

197
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,800
application code

198
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,520
and the underlying hsm that actually um

199
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,280
sorry between the calling application

200
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,199
and the underlying hsm there is an

201
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,199
abstraction layer in between

202
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,680
um and that's the script or service

203
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,960
gateway where we have a security policy

204
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,000
that is telling the underlying hsm what

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
exactly to do and what application uh

206
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
what code to use

207
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,680
so that the

208
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
calling application can be completely

209
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,720
oblivious of the actual cryptography

210
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,599
that is being used in the hsm

211
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,000
so this is what um csg is doing

212
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,039
right

213
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,400
and it's great to see that you're

214
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,879
already uh you're really in a position

215
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,039
to to to respond in that way uh perhaps

216
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,840
next to you raphael if i could ask you

217
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
you recently uh co-authored a paper

218
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,120
transitioning organization to

219
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,280
post-sponsor cryptography published in

220
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,000
nature in may of this year uh perhaps

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,400
you could give us a brief rundown as to

222
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,319
i mean the paper i couldn't actually

223
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,080
access it online unfortunately but would

224
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
you give us a quick rundown of the

225
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,279
highlights

226
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,039
yes so basically this is a paper that

227
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,120
reviewed the literature on what are the

228
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,399
promising strategies to migrate to pqc

229
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,880
we discuss for example

230
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,680
hybrid approach y seems to be a very

231
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,480
important strategy to migrate to pqc

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,040
without losing the classical security

233
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
we also talk or let's say maybe

234
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,120
speculate about the quantum computing

235
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,880
development time frame

236
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,720
and why it's important for the

237
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
organizations to start working on this

238
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,399
transition now

239
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,320
uh it's really a collection of good

240
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,240
practices and and the consensus in the

241
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,640
community about what can be done now and

242
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,800
what needs to be done in the near future

243
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,320
so for example maybe if i can mention

244
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,480
one thing we highlight in the paper

245
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,519
is the

246
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,440
uh the task of creating a crypto

247
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,600
inventory for companies

248
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,920
which is basically finding where you're

249
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,000
using classical cryptography which is a

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,360
non-trivial problem for large

251
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,519
organizations as you can think like

252
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,160
google microsoft it's really hard to see

253
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,240
where we are using cryptography in a

254
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
holistic point of view

255
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,440
so

256
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,640
it's really a collection of good

257
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
practices i really encourage you to have

258
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,640
a look uh to be honest i don't really

259
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,519
expect to it's not really anything new

260
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,920
but i think it's a it's a solid review

261
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,839
of the good practices that are currently

262
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,440
available

263
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,880
thanks raphael

264
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,560
uh michael there with with ibm i think

265
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
uh i'm quoting you correctly when you

266
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,399
you said you described cryptographic

267
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,399
strategies around agility in most

268
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,720
industries has been a mess

269
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,240
right like i think a couple of people

270
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,800
use the word that this is all a bit of a

271
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,760
mess right perhaps you could uh comment

272
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,519
on that and perhaps on on ibm strategy

273
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,519
sure i mean if you i mean i i happen to

274
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,760
have been around around the migration of

275
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,079
rsa to elliptic curve cryptography so i

276
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,160
had quite a lot of insight into kind of

277
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,760
what works well and what doesn't work

278
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,880
well then

279
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,800
but if you actually look that there are

280
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,959
so many um enterprises that still use

281
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,000
md5 still you share one steal these days

282
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,240
uh for many many reasons so i think it's

283
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,079
a little bit idealistic

284
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,160
to think that we're going to migrate all

285
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,880
of our legacy applications

286
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,720
this time when we haven't been able to

287
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,800
do it in the fun in the past

288
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,880
so so so what does that actually mean i

289
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,279
think it's um

290
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,440
you can look at things like agility and

291
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,000
strategy and standards as a as a kind of

292
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,959
a y2k type problem

293
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,959
but i think it would be a tragedy if um

294
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,279
if for example things became quantum

295
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,640
safe at the cost of other very important

296
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,200
security strategies such as xero trust

297
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,079
such as secure software supply chain

298
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,360
so for us

299
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,399
it's very much

300
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,760
about looking

301
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,200
where the security puck is going uh to

302
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,920
to quote wayne gret gretzky and and

303
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,600
really focus on

304
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,120
let's say making sure that where we're

305
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,079
headed is is quantum safe not

306
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,680
necessarily where we've come from

307
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,000
because at the end of the day

308
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,240
uh if if we just end up making things

309
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,839
quantum safe there's so many other

310
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,640
security problems that are probably far

311
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,399
worse um

312
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,240
we'll have wasted a great opportunity so

313
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,160
it's really about you know making sure

314
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,600
that all of the all of these big

315
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,120
security plays um are the vehicle for

316
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,279
introducing um

317
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,839
quantum safety

318
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,920
right

319
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,480
might be at a good time now to perhaps

320
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,560
get your opinions on on the recent this

321
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,800
competition and it's its outcome and

322
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,040
since i have you there michael i think

323
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,920
perhaps ibm are to be congratulated on

324
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,880
having

325
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,959
if you like backed the winners

326
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:11,920
uh

327
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,000
as ibm were very much involved with the

328
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,680
schemes that eventually were

329
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,200
standardized

330
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,120
so uh

331
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
what what made you go go take that

332
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
direction

333
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,839
can you explain your success

334
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,279
well just with lattice-based

335
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,880
cryptography that we have a very long

336
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,120
history going back to fully homomorphic

337
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,880
encryption you know

338
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,399
over a decade ago so there was a

339
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,959
generally um very

340
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,240
uh that say we're comfortable around

341
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,320
a lot of research in these areas i mean

342
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,720
to be fair we are also very interested

343
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,680
in psyche so with luca who've just seen

344
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,399
so we have looked at a number of schemes

345
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,480
uh we do invest in the number of schemes

346
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,519
because we're also very cognizant that

347
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,800
um

348
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,880
whereas lattice is about the nearest you

349
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
have to a drop in replacement it's not

350
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,399
going to be a drop in replacement for

351
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,880
everything some things are going to need

352
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,279
smaller keys or smaller certificates so

353
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,959
so the end to have the right right

354
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,959
portfolio of um

355
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,440
of of of

356
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,600
let's say research in in cryptography is

357
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,920
very important to us

358
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,399
yeah i mean i i heard a rumor i know i

359
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,680
shouldn't spread rumors i don't

360
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,360
necessarily believe rumors but i did

361
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
hear a rumor that ibm were actually

362
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,360
rolling out products with uh

363
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,279
lattice-based crypto in it prior to the

364
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,800
nist announcement so i don't know if you

365
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
care

366
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,320
actually since the number of iterations

367
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,279
i mean

368
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,279
i think one one thing about agility is

369
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,560
if if you serialize all of the steps to

370
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,880
actually get to production crypto

371
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,839
um

372
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,120
that takes a lot longer than

373
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,639
parallelizing certain steps so it was

374
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,639
very important to us to release

375
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,360
pre-candidate versions around two around

376
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,600
three versions of our algorithms purely

377
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,839
to get experiences to

378
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,519
um you know being able to migrate

379
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,040
between different versions of an

380
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,480
algorithm because i'm sure that'll be an

381
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,800
issue going forward as well as we need

382
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,399
to understand what it takes to to

383
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,480
migrate some of our platforms so it was

384
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,399
a very conscious decision

385
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,480
um with together with the faith in in

386
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,160
what we were doing

387
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,040
um

388
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,680
to actually uh make this available in

389
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,399
into products so so i mentioned briefly

390
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
the the z16 announcement so these

391
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,399
algorithms already optimized and baked

392
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,519
into

393
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,360
the hardware security module and the

394
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,519
stacks of software built on on top of

395
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,680
that so for us it's already an algorithm

396
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,199
that um

397
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,680
we have committed to

398
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,560
um

399
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,079
you know as regardless of the nist

400
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,800
outcome i would say so but obviously um

401
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,079
very very happy that um that our faith

402
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,920
um was also shared by others in that

403
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,199
respect

404
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,279
yeah so so you you backed your own hunch

405
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,959
and uh i guess that's

406
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,959
that's to be commended

407
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,120
uh edwin uh

408
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,800
perhaps are you you're a good person

409
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,240
maybe to just i mean we're gonna talk

410
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,800
about psych a bit obviously i i know

411
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,120
back in the day you were involved with i

412
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,720
saw genevieve's crypto one of the

413
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,680
earlier researchers i just have you any

414
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,519
view on uh on what just happened

415
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,120
um

416
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,959
it's an exciting development for someone

417
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,600
like me who is who has no personal

418
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,279
interest in psych

419
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,440
um to see that high level really good

420
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,240
smart mathematics is being applied yet

421
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,600
again

422
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
to analyze cryptography

423
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,399
in that sense i would see the

424
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,959
the fall of psych as

425
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,199
as speaking as a mathematician as a

426
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,519
breakthrough

427
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,000
that suddenly something new totally

428
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,959
unexpected is able to completely crack

429
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,480
the system

430
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,040
as it seems now and this is a good

431
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,560
reminder

432
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,040
if you look at the

433
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,279
current system that these unexpected

434
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,839
things can fail um so far in public key

435
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,639
crypto what we have seen in the with rsa

436
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,279
and ecc is that we had incremental

437
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,240
improvements over the past 15 to 20

438
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,800
years nothing really dramatic happened

439
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,759
and then

440
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,959
um

441
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,360
this was not expected for me at least

442
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,079
for psych um to see something this

443
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,480
dramatic

444
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,040
can i ask you i mean just as the

445
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
significance of it do you regard it as

446
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,600
just a knockdown punch for isogenes i

447
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,360
mean the misogynist will pick themselves

448
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,199
up dust themselves down and get glowing

449
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,800
again or is this a stick through the

450
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,959
heart type of thing i've been watching

451
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,399
too many vampire movies

452
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,959
um i wouldn't view it as a stake through

453
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,399
the heart

454
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,079
just as was mentioned in the previous

455
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,279
round table that um certain classes of

456
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,279
elliptic curves got completely taken

457
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,320
down

458
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,560
and we still are using elliptic curve

459
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,079
cryptography with confidence

460
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
okay thank you uh

461
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,040
next question is i think i'll go with uh

462
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
to raphael and then let me put this to

463
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,720
you that there's there's

464
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,559
three three types of crypto that we need

465
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,480
to cover up one is

466
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,359
uh chems signatures and then what i call

467
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,880
the other nice stuff

468
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,959
right now uh

469
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,959
i lattice i think one of the reasons

470
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,280
that is maybe one is that they they hit

471
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,079
all three right whereas you your

472
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,400
involvement is primarily with code-based

473
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,880
uh crypto i mean first of all i know

474
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,319
you're a very strong uh candidate uh

475
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,120
in the competition uh and that your own

476
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,440
involvement is in kobe is crypto

477
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,480
but uh

478
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,039
do do you think code based crypto as a

479
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,880
future

480
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,679
yes so i think as actually dashing

481
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,600
mentioned in the previous panel i think

482
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,080
we need diversity uh i think the

483
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,280
selected scheme for can now kyber is a

484
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,679
very good candidate but i think it would

485
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,360
be very uh

486
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,000
very risky to put all the all the eggs

487
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
in the same basket and rely only on

488
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,160
latches for camps

489
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,240
so code based cryptography i think even

490
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,919
as mentioned in the report

491
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,080
um in particular bike is mentioned as

492
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,120
the most performant known latches scheme

493
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,320
i think

494
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,880
it should be a very interesting uh

495
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,120
site option um

496
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,360
now

497
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:17,840
um

498
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,039
[Music]

499
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,960
let's also mention that code based

500
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,720
cryptography also has a very

501
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,559
conservative approach which is classic

502
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,160
mekalis so

503
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,880
i think it's really now that psych is

504
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,039
kind of gone i think it's really the

505
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,280
best family for exploring known largest

506
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,600
constructions we have both efficiency

507
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,760
and conservative uh features

508
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,160
okay thanks uh brian uh

509
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
you you guys were again very much

510
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,440
involved a lot of input into the

511
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,880
competition i think you're involved with

512
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,080
frodo psych picnic q tesla

513
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,320
uh just your your views on the on the

514
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,919
none of them made the cuts in the end of

515
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:56,720
the day

516
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,320
but did you just just your views on the

517
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,240
competition and its outcome and maybe

518
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,480
your views on psych and

519
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,840
what just happened

520
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,559
so

521
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,320
so a few things so thanks yeah we this

522
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,480
was the first time really that microsoft

523
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,960
had participated as part of industry and

524
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,360
academic collaborations in uh

525
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,600
in a nist competition or pseudo

526
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
competition since technically this is a

527
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,960
standardization activity since it

528
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,440
selects multiple winners um i think this

529
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,600
did a fantastic job and continues to do

530
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,480
so

531
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,120
um and i fully support them getting

532
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,679
future funding to continue to take their

533
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,840
standards to iso and things like that

534
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,760
and dustin's heard me advocate for that

535
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,000
before i think they had a very hard job

536
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,280
this was um the most diverse set of

537
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,440
candidates they had received and i

538
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,400
remember

539
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,799
when we sat here at santa barbara

540
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,280
talking about you know the competition

541
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,200
for aes and the competition for shot

542
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,080
three

543
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,000
and what was what we're trying to

544
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,559
accomplish here was more difficult um

545
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,960
you know we got involved in our

546
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,039
submissions based on where our expertise

547
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,559
was and uh our collaborations

548
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,200
and on frodo we took a very conservative

549
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,400
approach we wanted unstructured lattices

550
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,360
we knew we were going to pay a

551
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,880
performance penalty on that but we

552
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,400
thought that was the most safe and

553
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,320
secure route to go

554
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,400
um we also knew there would be a lot of

555
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,559
submissions on structured lattices and

556
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,760
it's going to be harder to distinguish

557
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,280
yourself on that

558
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,039
we were the only misogyny based scheme

559
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,880
and if you asked me four weeks ago i

560
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,400
would have told you that things looked

561
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,720
really kind of good and

562
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,559
we really liked the small key size

563
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,039
as an alternative to the choices that

564
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,320
were made in the structured lattice

565
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,360
games

566
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,840
um but this is why we do cryptography

567
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,760
right and this is why we gain confidence

568
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,080
in algorithms by trying to break them

569
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,320
and i would remind everybody that it was

570
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,840
18 years ago in this room that

571
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,159
xiaoyongwang got up and broke md5 in

572
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,240
front of all of us right and that set

573
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,600
off a whole wave of war and so um

574
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,840
you know we microsoft put challenge

575
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,880
money up behind psych and behind picnic

576
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,400
because we wanted to encourage

577
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,960
cryptanalysis work and i think that 50

578
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,200
000 just paid off spectacularly as far

579
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,080
as i'm concerned it was a and to get

580
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,240
this kind of a new fundamental result

581
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,520
it's fantastic

582
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,480
um

583
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,600
it came at a time between rounds when if

584
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
we could find a patch we have the

585
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,760
opportunity to possibly submit it

586
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,120
let's say things are looking very good

587
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,640
right now based on the more recent

588
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,559
results that have come out but

589
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,120
i think the overall competition has gone

590
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,400
very well

591
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,120
um and we've seen a lot of public study

592
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,880
of the candidates

593
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,480
and i think the results that come out of

594
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,159
this we're going to have good confidence

595
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:38,880
in

596
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,720
so you know

597
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,919
i still think we're going to end up

598
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,679
hybridizing things through the rest of

599
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,200
the decade because we got to keep

600
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,720
building up that confidence and all the

601
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,200
new things but overall um

602
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,400
i think

603
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,919
nist has done a great job and they

604
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,039
should be applauded for the work they've

605
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,520
done so far

606
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,440
i mean we've been through the

607
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,960
competition do you think we should just

608
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,400
accept the outcome and take it from

609
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,000
there or would you welcome around four

610
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,360
would you do you want to have another

611
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,280
churn through this well first off there

612
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,960
is going to be around four obviously and

613
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,360
uh again we were and i think technically

614
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,320
psych is still part of round four so um

615
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,480
i think that

616
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,039
what we've seen is that

617
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,360
at any point in time we could get a

618
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,240
cryptan a new crypt analytic result

619
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,679
that breaks something we're dependent

620
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,120
upon so having a second chem is a good

621
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,640
idea um

622
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,039
i will i will take this to task on the

623
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,039
following point on the signature side i

624
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,520
wish that they had actually picked

625
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,480
one between diligent and falcon and i

626
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,679
say that and i know that they give a

627
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,919
preference to dilithium my concern on

628
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,919
this point and i think folks understand

629
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,200
this is that falcons got better size

630
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,799
and better performance characteristics

631
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,720
if you've got the floating point support

632
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
and i am worried that when we get to the

633
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,960
next stage of things outside of nist and

634
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
in the ietf and other places we're going

635
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,039
to see working groups diverge in terms

636
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,280
of what they choose to follow

637
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,200
this is actually if you read my

638
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,720
communication with the acm column from

639
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
january where i talk about waves

640
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,960
cascades and long tails right waves of

641
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,520
outputs from nist triggering cascades of

642
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,200
standardization work and protocol

643
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,679
standards in the ietf elsewhere

644
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,840
and the long tail of small community

645
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,880
protocols that are going to take a

646
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,400
longer time to update tls is going to

647
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,600
happen quick

648
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,520
right ipsec s mime lamps doesn't happen

649
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,640
more quickly

650
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,960
um but the things that have multiple

651
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,799
internal dependencies on other standards

652
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,640
are going to take longer to update

653
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,640
and my worry is we're going to see some

654
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,919
fracturing

655
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,400
in the way in which individual protocol

656
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,640
standards choose to hybridize choose to

657
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,279
do hybrid signatures choose to hybrid

658
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,320
chems

659
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,240
or even the choices between something as

660
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,360
simple as

661
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,960
what's the mandatory to implement and

662
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,159
what's the nice to have between

663
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,240
dilithium and falcon and i think we're

664
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,919
going to end up implementing all those

665
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:54,880
um

666
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,559
and i just worry that we're not going to

667
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,279
get as much convergence as we could get

668
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,360
so that would be my only

669
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,600
constructive criticism and this had its

670
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,679
reasons for doing what it did but that's

671
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,039
the only drawback i could see at around

672
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,200
three outputs right and just to

673
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,400
acknowledge

674
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
brian as a paper the long road ahead of

675
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,600
the transition to post quantum

676
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,080
cryptography in the cac in january this

677
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,799
year where you can find more details and

678
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,840
all of that

679
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,799
uh

680
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,520
perhaps uh michael can maybe get back to

681
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,400
you

682
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,159
would you do you welcome around for or

683
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,159
you guys just gone ahead with what we've

684
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,600
got and you don't want to look on the

685
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,880
rear view mirror and uh what

686
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,559
no i think it's really really important

687
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,320
don't forget the quantum is not the only

688
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,720
technology on the horizon which can be a

689
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,159
threat to crypto there's things like

690
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,159
neuromorphic computing in memory

691
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,520
computing aiai based attacks

692
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,880
um

693
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,039
the future is as more uncertain i think

694
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,200
than it's ever been in terms of cool new

695
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
technologies and um

696
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
the opportunity for them to be misused

697
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,600
in in breaking things

698
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,440
and that's all the more reason to have a

699
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,360
steady stream of

700
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,880
you know when you when you talk about

701
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,640
agility i think agility needs to go

702
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,120
across the crypto life cycle so in terms

703
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,400
of standards there needs to be a

704
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,200
continuous pipeline of standards uh

705
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,720
algorithm development and then the

706
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,279
implementations and deployment so i

707
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,240
think continuous is a very important

708
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,159
word because it's the continuing

709
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,559
continuity of the work in the different

710
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,760
areas which is going to give you

711
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,600
protection against this very uncertain

712
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,080
future we're entering

713
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,279
okay well

714
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,720
maybe it's time to just

715
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,120
to talk about that uncertainty um i i

716
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,200
got a lovely quote from paulo

717
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,120
from the first session where he said

718
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,799
it's hard to make predictions especially

719
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,200
about the future which i think that's a

720
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,360
great quote isn't it yeah

721
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,559
you

722
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,240
you you can't uh but like that but so

723
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,840
one thing i'm aware of that the through

724
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
three other participants in the

725
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
roundtable today work for companies who

726
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,679
as well as uh you know

727
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,600
developing post quantum methods for

728
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,039
cryptography

729
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,880
the if you like with the right hand the

730
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,080
left hand of their companies are

731
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,679
actually actively developing quantum

732
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,440
computers right so uh they would should

733
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,039
be in a good position i mean i presume

734
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,559
you have conversations over the water

735
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,640
cooler about with the the other side of

736
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,720
the house as to how is it going uh are

737
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,279
you getting places are we any closer

738
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,240
uh so i'm i'm going to ask you i'm

739
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,799
quite happy if you you don't really want

740
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,279
to respond in any detail but i think i

741
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,679
mean i'll make a prediction uh just i'll

742
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,200
stick my neck out first and see if

743
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,480
there's anyone else want to stick theirs

744
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,679
out

745
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,720
i would predict that we won't see a a

746
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,960
a a cryptographically relevant quantum

747
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,440
computer i won't see one in my lifetime

748
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,840
and i'm feeling pretty healthy i'm

749
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,520
i reckon i'm going to be around for a

750
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,760
while yet so uh

751
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,080
i'd just like to ask you if you want and

752
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,760
and you guys are an awful lot more

753
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,440
because of the the companies you work

754
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,039
with you know you're inside to be far

755
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,200
superior to mine i'm just working on my

756
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,520
gut you're actually working off much

757
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,320
harder information than that just to go

758
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,080
on the table and ask you what do you

759
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,639
think yourself

760
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,640
i can stay silent on that matter since

761
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,080
i'm not

762
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,480
working for a company that is actively

763
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,799
developing quantum computers

764
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,559
um i sleep calmly and i am more worried

765
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,679
about

766
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,000
vulnerability vulnerabilities at this

767
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,320
stage against classical attacks

768
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,399
as i think it was mike who said that

769
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,320
there are still companies out there that

770
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,760
haven't updated their classical

771
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,320
algorithms

772
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,600
yeah that's a good answer uh raphael

773
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
uh yes i think actually this discussion

774
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,679
is more about risk assessment

775
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,840
i think if there is a chance that such a

776
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
quantum computer appears in the next 10

777
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,320
years i think it's already enough for us

778
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,880
to move the needle and really prioritize

779
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,679
this

780
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,000
uh in terms of prediction yeah i'm not

781
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,360
really in a position to talk about the

782
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,240
quantum computing roadmap at google

783
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,720
but uh i think everything what people

784
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,559
are talking about is

785
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,480
having a chance that this happens by

786
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,320
2030 or

787
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,520
sometime

788
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,600
maybe later i think that's really enough

789
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,919
for us to prioritize this uh to put this

790
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,240
as a top priority i would say

791
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,039
okay

792
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,960
brian i think you've mentioned the year

793
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,760
2030 in a couple of places has been

794
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,159
significant well what do you think

795
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,279
okay so

796
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,880
i guess two points the first one is i

797
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
think one of the best resources on this

798
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,559
is the survey that michaela mosca and

799
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,080
the other folks at

800
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,320
evolution q or the rio

801
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,240
risk i forgot the exact name of your

802
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,360
organization

803
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,880
um they but they put a survey out where

804
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,240
they actually surveyed quantum

805
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,000
physicists and folks actually building

806
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,120
quantum computers uh to get uh estimates

807
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,279
as to when do they think how far away it

808
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,120
is and you look at the graphs on that

809
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,720
and what people think

810
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,399
and the percentages of folks who think

811
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,480
there's a 50 50 chance within 15 years

812
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,640
from today or so so i would first point

813
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,880
you to i believe the 2021 is the most

814
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,679
recent one and to go go pull that that

815
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,279
survey

816
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,880
when i started my project at msr on this

817
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,279
was in early 2015 uh before the nist

818
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,279
modification announcement during which

819
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,039
was in august of that year i went to a

820
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,320
quantum computer team and i said when do

821
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,960
you think we're going to see a

822
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,240
cryptographically relevant we didn't

823
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,559
even know what that meant precisely

824
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,799
and they said 15 years that was their

825
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,279
finger in the air guess

826
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,720
well we're now

827
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,640
seven years past then and they're still

828
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,880
telling me 15 years so you know you can

829
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,480
kind of argue that 15 years kind of

830
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,159
shifts um

831
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,600
look there's some real hard problems

832
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,279
here we know that we probably are

833
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,399
looking at

834
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,440
needing 2 000 logical scalable quantum

835
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
bits right fall tolerance tolerant

836
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,120
quantum bits

837
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,960
we'll be lucky if we get a thousand to

838
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,279
one physical to logical so you're

839
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,720
looking at a couple million physical

840
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,880
bits for scaling the systems

841
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,679
and the folks i talked to now say

842
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,720
they're not even sure any of the

843
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,320
physical systems that are being used to

844
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,640
build qubits these days

845
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,159
will be able to scale that much and that

846
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,919
we might have to develop a different

847
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,120
mechanism

848
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,039
to actually build a qubit before we're

849
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,880
going to be able to build two million or

850
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,559
more physical

851
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,679
um

852
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,200
that being said

853
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,440
it comes back to as raphael said your

854
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,240
risk assessment if my concern is i'm

855
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,399
protecting national security data that's

856
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,200
got a 50 year or more security horizon i

857
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,640
got to worry about what the adversary

858
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,399
has gotten 50 years

859
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,320
and yet i do think within that envelope

860
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,679
we're going to see

861
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,679
you know cryptographic quantum computers

862
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,840
before then i don't think it's a never

863
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,399
going to happen situation

864
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,480
2030 might be optimistic now looking at

865
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,760
where things are

866
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,039
um but it's gonna take us

867
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,039
we'll be lucky if the us government gets

868
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,679
all their systems migrated by 2035 as

869
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,880
was the date that was just set in

870
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,360
national security memo 10.

871
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,559
i think we'll be lucky if we can get

872
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,520
everything by then all right okay

873
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,880
michael jordan

874
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,440
your two cents worth um

875
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,240
yeah

876
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,480
i guess a couple of things so so one of

877
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,960
them i spoke to some some very esteemed

878
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,440
colleagues who were around in the area

879
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,960
when cmos

880
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,880
uh was uh was a very expensive

881
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,760
experimental technology uh to resist a

882
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,320
system that didn't look unlike early

883
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,640
quantum systems and very there was like

884
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,799
50 50 percent splitting people saying

885
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,360
that technology would never scale

886
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,720
nothing

887
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,480
we're kind of seeing a bit of a repeat

888
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,720
of this so 10 years ago

889
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,120
90 of the cryptographers in my team did

890
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,840
not believe in this they it was kind of

891
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,640
um in the sense it was um

892
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,080
you know the

893
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,600
such quantum machines never going to be

894
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,760
built et cetera et cetera et cetera

895
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
now i think most

896
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,080
now it's the primary focus of what we do

897
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,240
and if i see i'm not going to commit

898
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,320
let's say commit um let's say if i see

899
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,000
the development i was also a little bit

900
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,320
skeptical understand the

901
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,799
the risk aspect that um that if

902
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,399
something happens and it's pretty

903
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,840
catastrophic

904
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,279
um but when i see the advancements

905
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,159
in um in progress

906
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,440
um

907
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,159
i am much i am not a skeptic anymore put

908
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,320
it this way um

909
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,240
and i guess you may have seen some

910
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,559
announcements this year but i think um i

911
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,120
i have been surprised at the progress

912
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,519
both on the efficiency of implement

913
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,679
implementation of quantum algorithms as

914
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:22,880
well as the

915
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,000
um

916
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,440
the technologies which are coming out

917
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,720
how to scale these things so um i can

918
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,440
only say that i am an awful lot less

919
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,600
skeptical than i was just a few years

920
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,360
ago

921
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,360
okay interesting

922
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,039
i i suppose

923
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,440
just briefly my own take on it i mean

924
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,559
peter's algorithm was from 1994 and i

925
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,919
remember reading about that in

926
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,000
scientific american i remember some

927
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,440
commentary at the time everyone's saying

928
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,039
that's very interesting but

929
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,799
cryptographers by and large just went

930
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,200
yeah and carried on business as usual

931
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,919
for another 10 years and really nobody

932
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,919
felt the need for a post quantum

933
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,679
competition that

934
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,080
nothing much happened

935
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,360
and then

936
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,519
well my view on it was probably

937
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,240
distorted but the d-wave this canadian

938
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,480
company came up with this technology and

939
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,159
suddenly quantum computing was getting

940
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,960
hyped height high types and it was only

941
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,640
much later that we realized that what d

942
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,039
we were doing isn't really relevant to

943
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,559
to our concerns

944
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,519
i mean

945
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,679
uh and and in the responsibility in

946
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,200
response to that mountain of hype that

947
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,120
happened we we've now

948
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,080
got spooked and we've we've reacted and

949
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,600
i suppose i have a view that maybe we

950
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,360
reacted too quickly is there a case for

951
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,440
just kicking the can down the road

952
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,600
by another decade maybe on the basis

953
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,120
that quantum computers are 10 years

954
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,799
further off than we thought they were

955
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,279
therefore we can put the the adoption of

956
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,519
post-quantum crypto back 10 years and 10

957
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,039
years time we'd be in a much better

958
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,080
position

959
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,000
to to make or in other words we can sort

960
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,240
of panic in here

961
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,600
anyone care to comment and i don't know

962
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,240
am i just talking nonsense

963
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,399
which is a possibility i'll take a shot

964
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,799
at that i don't think we're panicking um

965
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,000
and i think that when you look at how

966
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,239
long it is taking

967
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,079
to run the competition

968
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,480
in which we knew which was i mean where

969
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,000
this is the timeline that nist set when

970
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,760
they announced it and then you look at

971
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,159
how long it takes commercial systems to

972
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,520
migrate

973
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,960
um

974
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,639
you have to start early because it's

975
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,000
going to take you 15 years right

976
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,918
again tls and things like that will

977
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,599
probably update and will get deployed

978
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,760
pretty quickly but when you look at the

979
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,119
deployments of elliptic curve

980
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,560
photography

981
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,639
there are still lots of the

982
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,839
broad

983
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,239
you know software ecosystem that have no

984
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,000
ecc support

985
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,399
or it's still just coming along and you

986
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,839
can trace the movement of industry to

987
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,918
ecc really back to 2005 when just

988
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,359
announced sweet v and that you had to

989
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,040
start shipping i remember when they

990
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,159
announced it

991
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,000
and we had a crash program because we

992
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,200
were in the middle of developing windows

993
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,560
vista and we had to get ecc into vista

994
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,800
if we wanted it to be purchased by the

995
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,040
u.s government just microsoft's single

996
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,200
largest customer um and that

997
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,640
necessitated

998
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,160
you know we had a cryptographically

999
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,920
agile api but it turned out it was

1000
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,400
cryptographically agile for rsa and dsa

1001
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,880
at diffie-hellman and it wasn't as agile

1002
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,720
as we needed to be for ecc and that led

1003
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,359
to a whole new api deployment um

1004
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,800
that takes time and we're still trying

1005
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,079
to get ecc out in parts and places so

1006
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,320
if i take that timeline and then i say

1007
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,160
okay now think about that for pq it's

1008
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,839
going to be even longer so i don't think

1009
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,079
we're i think we're being prudent

1010
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,359
and i think we're being prudent because

1011
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,960
we got to build up confidence in all of

1012
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,800
these new algorithms as we as we deploy

1013
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,359
them and study them right which

1014
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,280
brings us nicely onto the whole issue of

1015
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,119
migration right the standards now in

1016
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,480
place

1017
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,400
migration policies i know you guys have

1018
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,920
all been thinking about this and your

1019
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,680
your your employers have been thinking

1020
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,440
about this and put a lot of planning

1021
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,960
into it uh

1022
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,359
uh so i suppose maybe i start again with

1023
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,760
with you brian uh

1024
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,280
i think i saw a

1025
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,960
talk where you've given you the slide up

1026
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,359
there in 2020 and you were talking about

1027
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,079
starting migration early in 2022

1028
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,839
according to the chart i mean which

1029
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,240
would suggest that you've started so

1030
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,480
first off that was my predicted timeline

1031
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,200
from 2015 which i showed to the execs at

1032
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,280
microsoft in 2018 to try to get them to

1033
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,119
start moving early

1034
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,480
i would say i was only partially

1035
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,000
successful in trying to build up some

1036
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,680
executive support there's a lot of

1037
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,800
knowledge

1038
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,480
but

1039
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,320
when you you know there's a real problem

1040
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,359
in trying to get developers to spend

1041
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,760
limited development cycles on

1042
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,599
cryptographic agility which is seen as a

1043
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,200
security tax and on migration when they

1044
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,880
have to trade that off against new

1045
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,079
features that they think are going to

1046
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,079
generate sales

1047
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,920
i think what's happening right now is

1048
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,520
that we have done

1049
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
uh trials and you've seen some of this

1050
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,200
in the open quantum sage project at

1051
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,760
waterloo where we've looked at you know

1052
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,359
integrating into tls and openssh and

1053
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,880
openvpn

1054
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,480
we did our big

1055
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,160
trial that we talked about afterwards we

1056
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,200
ran a pq encrypted network tunnel to our

1057
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,720
underwater data center off the north

1058
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,640
coast of scotland to test viability of

1059
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,000
algorithms

1060
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,680
and that was really a test case for

1061
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,440
talking about how we would

1062
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,119
deploy for something like azure data

1063
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,160
center connections around the world

1064
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,960
the thing we have to be careful about uh

1065
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,160
especially when you're talking about

1066
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,160
something like windows is we don't want

1067
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,960
to

1068
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,800
support and deploy something before the

1069
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,760
standards out and then have to end up

1070
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,839
supporting a non-standard thing at the

1071
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,240
end of the day so that's why you see us

1072
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,920
participating in the ietf on

1073
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,280
standardization activities and things

1074
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,839
like that but a lot of the deployments

1075
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,280
in the products and services is going to

1076
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,040
depend upon the protocol standards

1077
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,480
following suit

1078
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,680
so

1079
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,440
you know there will be interrupt testing

1080
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,000
uh there was mentioned earlier of the of

1081
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,760
the national cyber security center of

1082
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,880
excellence nccoe project on pqc

1083
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,359
migration we are partners with nist in

1084
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,720
that along with

1085
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,119
uh many other folks and that's a place

1086
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,640
where um

1087
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,760
they're that that project's gonna

1088
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,280
develop tools to help companies with

1089
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,599
migration to do inventories and do

1090
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,520
probably some test vetting

1091
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,920
as well um and so i think that's a good

1092
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,440
next resource

1093
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,200
um but we are i think the entire

1094
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,960
migration is not happening as fast as i

1095
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,400
would necessarily like

1096
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,720
but some of that is just dependent upon

1097
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,960
standardization time and protocol

1098
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,440
standardization time right now it's

1099
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,800
understandable we've only just got the

1100
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,560
standard right i understand you guys

1101
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,839
have doing all the testing in the

1102
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,920
threats of that but neither

1103
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,200
the starting gun is fire oh yeah guys

1104
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,599
yeah i mean so at this point right the

1105
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,720
while

1106
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,960
again up until four weeks ago we were

1107
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,560
also going to be you know we were still

1108
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,720
pursuing the research stuff on site but

1109
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,960
as far as the product teams go you know

1110
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,960
they are now aware of what needs to get

1111
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,440
done and they are actively seeing this

1112
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,800
come up in various ietf working groups

1113
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,400
and you're going to see that

1114
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,839
that work continue and then it's going

1115
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,960
to migrate into the into the products um

1116
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,040
this choice about about signatures to

1117
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,400
support i think is something that a

1118
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,920
bunch of our product teams and one of

1119
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,599
the things i've been concerned about is

1120
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,480
the

1121
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,920
chair of our internal cryptography

1122
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,280
review board is making sure that all of

1123
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
microsoft speaks with one voice

1124
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,760
and that as our product teams are out in

1125
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,839
various standards activities

1126
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,720
that we're not supporting different

1127
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,160
applications like different

1128
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,079
hybridization methods between two

1129
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,240
different groups that we unify and that

1130
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,240
we get the industry to unify as much

1131
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,160
around sort of standard ways of doing

1132
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,839
the things that are

1133
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,520
adjacent to the standards but not part

1134
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,839
of them is standards proper right

1135
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,200
okay well maybe

1136
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,400
raphael or google off and running i know

1137
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,359
again you've done a lot of

1138
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,040
experimentation with

1139
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,720
you'll be playing around with tls and

1140
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,320
putting post quantum stuff in there and

1141
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,520
seeing how it worked out but uh is

1142
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,560
google now charging down the

1143
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,640
the migration pipeline

1144
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,520
this definitely is a top priority for us

1145
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,119
in the past we published some

1146
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,960
experiments with chrome our colleague

1147
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
adam langley worked with some colleagues

1148
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,640
from cloudflare they had very

1149
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,839
interesting results about the

1150
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,119
feasibility of deploying pqc in kls

1151
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,000
um

1152
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,880
now what is happening more recently is

1153
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,640
we are trying to identify what are the

1154
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,599
top priority projects within google that

1155
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,760
require an earlier transition

1156
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,200
so here there are things like for

1157
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,119
example things that depend on hardware

1158
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,400
for example

1159
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,560
where public keys are making into harder

1160
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,480
so you have a very long lifespan for the

1161
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,280
product you need to accommodate all the

1162
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,839
time for

1163
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,280
uh for finalizing the standardization

1164
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,119
process then integrating this into

1165
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,640
harder and knowing that this is being

1166
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,480
defeated for a long time

1167
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,800
um other things like for example

1168
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,520
encryption in transit is also a very uh

1169
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,920
interesting use case for early pqc

1170
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,200
adoption

1171
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,640
because it's something that you can just

1172
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,960
switch the algorithm at any point

1173
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,720
so we don't really need to to have the

1174
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,319
final specs from this so that's

1175
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,480
something we can start exploring

1176
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,760
there's a bunch of things that were

1177
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,839
starting to work but i think as of now

1178
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,680
how i can describe this is about

1179
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,280
prioritization we are trying to find

1180
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,560
what are the

1181
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,599
most important nodes in our network and

1182
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,240
and infrastructure right

1183
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,760
but your view would be

1184
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,480
the competition's over that that that

1185
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,200
book is closed time to move on

1186
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,720
yes exactly

1187
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,560
yes we are

1188
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,480
trying to make everything prepared for

1189
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,119
this uh final announcement right

1190
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,200
uh edwin uh

1191
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
you're involved with cryptomatic are

1192
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,800
cryptomatic

1193
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,119
ready to ship products with uh the new

1194
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,640
standard

1195
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,040
um well the standard isn't out there yet

1196
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,599
we are ready to ship um the crypto

1197
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,920
agility and we are ready to help people

1198
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,400
becoming crypto agile and to stay within

1199
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,839
your analysis with the asteroid um

1200
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,000
the best way to protect against an a

1201
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,079
good way to protect against the asteroid

1202
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,079
and you're not knowing when it's hidden

1203
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,400
is to build a good shelter and that will

1204
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,800
also protect against tornadoes and then

1205
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,920
you can um think about how you equip

1206
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,800
your shelter later on once the latest

1207
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,040
technology is out that you can that can

1208
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,839
help you

1209
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,520
and so

1210
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,680
with some things um

1211
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,800
we are we can readily deploy um

1212
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,119
post quantum cryptography given that

1213
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,680
there are some hsn providers who already

1214
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,599
offer across quantum cryptography as

1215
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,839
part of the implementations

1216
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,800
and with others all what we can help is

1217
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,359
becoming crypto agile so that you can

1218
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,160
make the switch whenever the algorithms

1219
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,079
are available and standardized if you're

1220
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,280
thinking for instance for the

1221
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,839
european union's qualified electronic

1222
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,040
signatures

1223
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,520
that can only be deployed once we have

1224
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,960
the correspondingly certified hsms so

1225
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,599
all what we can work on here is to

1226
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,960
become

1227
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,480
ready for that switch whenever

1228
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,599
it becomes a reality to do so

1229
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,760
so i view migration as a two-step

1230
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,599
process first

1231
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,319
get ready to be crypto agile and then

1232
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,640
make the switch whenever

1233
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,400
we are ready to do so when the actual

1234
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,640
standards are out and then we can tie

1235
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,480
all the loose nuts

1236
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,520
right

1237
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,520
uh michael i i get the sense that you

1238
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,280
guys are out of the blocks already on

1239
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,839
this so you're a good guy to ask the the

1240
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,920
follow-up question which is

1241
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,640
uh hybridization do we go hybrid or do

1242
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,880
we not i mean to me it seems like an

1243
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,640
absolute no-brainer that we need to

1244
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,520
start off with hybrid products but it's

1245
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,880
not obvious to other people and other

1246
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,680
people i respect disagree so what are

1247
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,160
you guys doing

1248
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,680
um

1249
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,200
it depends so

1250
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,640
obviously making the algorithms

1251
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,640
available so that people who program

1252
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,800
against those on our platform so it's a

1253
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,400
platform-specific

1254
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,960
um thing that we make the algorithms

1255
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,880
available for people to use however they

1256
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,760
want

1257
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,400
we also announced on the on the larger

1258
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,760
platforms

1259
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,520
um the the they boot into a quantum safe

1260
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,760
state so there we have used hybrid and

1261
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,280
the reason for using hybrid is purely

1262
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,240
because

1263
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,920
the the standards are not there yet the

1264
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,599
trust is not there yet so so there is um

1265
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,359
i would say that there is there are

1266
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,200
arguments for hybrids

1267
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,359
um i would comment

1268
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,960
i have a couple of comments the hybrid

1269
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,400
though um

1270
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,839
let's say

1271
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,070
the as as luca said in the previous um

1272
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,400
[Music]

1273
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,839
talk that

1274
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,920
there are there are ways to get hybrid

1275
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,400
wrong and and generally what we see is

1276
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,240
that there are far more problems with

1277
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,640
crypto implementations than there are

1278
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,319
with the underlying

1279
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,599
um

1280
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,480
algorithms so to speak and and the

1281
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,839
the killer in for security is complexity

1282
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,599
so i think hybrid needs to be done very

1283
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,079
carefully if i remember back to the ec

1284
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,760
transition times

1285
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,800
then

1286
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,280
you could tunnel for example so so you

1287
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,200
wouldn't sort of try and and create a

1288
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,760
protocol where the hybrid aspect was

1289
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
somehow baked into the protocol but you

1290
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,640
would use layers to to achieve a hybrid

1291
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,800
effect so i would caution against

1292
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,560
complexity because this is where things

1293
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,560
always go wrong nevertheless what one um

1294
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,319
certainly um

1295
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,880
up until the period where you have when

1296
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,240
this has provided the assurance schemes

1297
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,240
and the certification processes i think

1298
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,240
it will be a necessity um my my worry is

1299
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,480
that and i think i think it was brian

1300
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,280
mentioned it at standards organizations

1301
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,760
there is a bit of um

1302
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,520
there are many standards organizations

1303
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,040
that need to justify what they do and

1304
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,119
unfortunately there's not a lot not

1305
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,720
enough of the skills in some of these

1306
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,560
techniques to go around

1307
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,560
and i worry that lots of people then go

1308
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,319
off in lots of different

1309
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,720
directions in in the very same way

1310
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,160
and and so

1311
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,839
i almost think

1312
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,480
that industry would be well served

1313
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,520
to have like a meta um

1314
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,760
not meta standard but as

1315
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,359
maybe this is something that ncco he

1316
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,119
could do or whatever but a set of

1317
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,319
suggestions for standards organizations

1318
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,560
about how to coordinate and to raise

1319
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,880
awareness of all the challenges we've

1320
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,599
had with things like um

1321
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,000
ucdsa and things like this deterministic

1322
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,400
non-deterministic there are many many

1323
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,119
opportunities for things to diverge and

1324
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,359
as a systems provider we have to sort of

1325
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,839
um you know make our systems that say

1326
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,760
support every things which are out there

1327
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,560
so

1328
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,359
so

1329
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,880
so some some

1330
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,720
it would be very valuable for industry

1331
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,400
to have some form of guidance for

1332
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,920
standards organizations about how to um

1333
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,920
how to maybe look forward and and

1334
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,119
prevent the sort of thing which has

1335
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,720
happened in the past which has made

1336
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,960
everybody's lives difficult

1337
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,880
right so i

1338
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,440
mean that's a problem with hybridization

1339
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,359
isn't it i mean

1340
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,800
we talk about things getting messy

1341
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,599
hybridization seems to take us in a in a

1342
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,920
potentially messy direction

1343
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,960
uh

1344
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,280
uh i suppose to buy my

1345
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,960
hybrid crypto is a bit like two-factor

1346
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,800
authentication isn't this case of to be

1347
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,720
sure to be sure as we say in ireland and

1348
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,880
we're going for an extra backup

1349
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,520
to uh hybridization yes or no for again

1350
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,319
um yes

1351
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:31,599
good that's a nice nice answer thank you

1352
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,280
uh raphael

1353
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,359
yes i would say absolutely needed at

1354
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,680
least for this coming years i think it

1355
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,599
would be very risky to have a full

1356
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,160
transition to any of the pqc algorithms

1357
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,240
maybe except for hash based signatures i

1358
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,319
think hash face signature is uh

1359
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,079
is a construction that we know for so

1360
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,240
long initially since basically the

1361
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,319
inception of public key cryptography we

1362
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,200
know about merkel or signature but we

1363
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,040
also know that hash based signatures are

1364
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,640
not suitable for

1365
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,480
most applications or many applications

1366
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,319
either because of performance or state

1367
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,559
management requirements

1368
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,640
but overall i would say that hybrid

1369
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,319
should be the preferred uh deployment

1370
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,040
strategy in the coming years yeah

1371
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,960
would you agree like let's take tls as

1372
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,400
an example let's take the key exchange

1373
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,839
in tls and let's say we want to go

1374
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,680
hybrid with that i mean the fact that

1375
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,520
we've got two schemes involved now

1376
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,440
presumably is a big multiplier in terms

1377
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,280
of messiness like what do we combine

1378
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,079
with what is it kyber 768 with uh with

1379
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:29,839
x25519 or is it another elliptic curve

1380
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,920
with a a different security level on

1381
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,920
kyber i mean the number of combinations

1382
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,359
if you like kind of yeah could

1383
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,280
potentially blow up in the absence of

1384
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,960
standards like

1385
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,240
what are we to do

1386
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,680
yeah and actually just touch a very

1387
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,520
important question on how to how to

1388
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,680
deploy hybrid in practice like for

1389
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,000
example with all these possibilities

1390
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,599
should we consider each algorithm

1391
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,079
independently or should we consider the

1392
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,640
conjunction of both as a new algorithm

1393
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,960
which i think is probably a very good

1394
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,880
approach so i think there will be lots

1395
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,800
of questions to be answered although

1396
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,240
hybrid looks like a simple strategy

1397
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,240
i would say that even cams are probably

1398
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,680
the easiest ones

1399
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,599
digital signatures become very very

1400
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,440
messy because you have so many options

1401
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,359
you could either for example sign your

1402
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,119
message using algorithm one and then

1403
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,040
sign the message using our algorithm

1404
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,359
true or you can sign using algorithm one

1405
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,520
and then sign the signature of our

1406
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,440
number one using algorithm two and and

1407
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,520
so on and so on so i think there will be

1408
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,680
a very uh there will be a significant

1409
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,000
increase in complexity but i think it's

1410
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,400
worth the the cost i think it's really

1411
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,440
uh the way to go given the

1412
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,280
how much is at stake

1413
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,920
brian i know you have got views on the

1414
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,440
hybrid issue so and

1415
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,480
maybe just to give you a direction

1416
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,559
there's there's a whole pki thing

1417
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,720
there's uh certificates i mean do we do

1418
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,480
we sign everything twice

1419
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,400
i mean what the impact of all that and

1420
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,319
how long will it take to for that to

1421
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,160
percolate through the system

1422
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,680
that floor's yours okay so a i do

1423
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,839
believe that we'll be deploying hybrid

1424
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,839
modes for probably at least the end of

1425
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,839
this decade would be my rough guest

1426
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,640
right now um that actually aligns with

1427
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,680
the ansi comments from their december

1428
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,800
document

1429
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,720
on what they predicted and our national

1430
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,480
academy's report that's due out the next

1431
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,920
month or so basically says the same

1432
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,800
thing

1433
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,599
so

1434
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,839
look for that when it's out um

1435
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,640
in the pki space we have done prototypes

1436
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,640
where we did concatenated signatures so

1437
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,160
we signed a cert

1438
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,160
where we generated signature one with

1439
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,680
algorithm one signature without one two

1440
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,079
concatenated together knew oid

1441
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,599
and did that in an hsm and did interrupt

1442
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:38,559
with

1443
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,599
uh open ssl and open ssh you know as

1444
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,480
part of the open quantum safe space um

1445
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,800
and that works and you know the software

1446
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,880
stacks support it but there you are

1447
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,880
defining a new signature algorithm at

1448
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,000
times

1449
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,160
uh there are some drawbacks to doing

1450
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,319
hybrid which is you're adding the size

1451
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,240
of the signatures and

1452
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,000
you know you're adding a number of bytes

1453
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,280
to it and when you're talking about

1454
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,000
signing every dll in windows and

1455
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,520
downloading that as part of windows

1456
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,200
update and things like that there's

1457
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,800
bandwidth costs and their size cost to

1458
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,599
it

1459
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,200
but that would seem to be the prudent

1460
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,000
safe space a safe thing to do right now

1461
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,520
especially if you're doing anything for

1462
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,680
long-term security where

1463
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,240
you want to give yourself an opportunity

1464
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,800
after the first algorithm breaks

1465
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,559
to go back and resign everything with

1466
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,960
say a third signature algorithm and

1467
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,040
double sign

1468
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,160
so

1469
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,920
i'm not so worried about the pki space i

1470
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,839
think that

1471
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,720
for online protocols where there is a

1472
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,240
like in tls

1473
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,240
where the client advertises what they

1474
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,760
know and what they're able to take and a

1475
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,760
server can

1476
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,839
select among a number of identity

1477
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,760
certificates for presentation that's

1478
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,640
okay

1479
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,960
in an offline mode where you have to

1480
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,880
guess at what the other endpoints gonna

1481
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,480
know and be able to validate that's a

1482
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,079
harder thing

1483
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,559
haven't yet seen a super strong case for

1484
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,160
some sort of backward compatible

1485
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,599
certificate there's been a lot of talk

1486
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:04,880
about that

1487
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,240
um

1488
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,200
sign with one in a classical algorithm

1489
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,160
embed a pq signature in an extension or

1490
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,319
something like that

1491
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,839
i would need to see a use case that

1492
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,160
actually needed that okay but i think

1493
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,400
that's definitely coming i will say this

1494
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,040
um there are some customers who have

1495
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,040
told us that they're not interested

1496
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,720
that they would prefer not hybrid modes

1497
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,359
they'd rather like wrap two separate

1498
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,599
instances they'd rather do a classical

1499
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,359
and then a quantum around it and they

1500
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,720
think that that is easier to analyze

1501
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,319
and i kind of understand those arguments

1502
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:39,680
but i don't think that's what you're

1503
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,280
going to see you know

1504
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,280
predominantly on the internet

1505
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,400
thanks brian

1506
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,760
francisco's telling me we have a couple

1507
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,520
of questions from the

1508
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,200
audience yes

1509
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,119
the first question comes from mike

1510
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,559
vermeer

1511
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,720
he's asking we are all doing risk

1512
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,440
assessment based on just a few known

1513
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,319
algorithms like shorts and glover

1514
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:03,200
we are doing uh calculations on quantum

1515
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,480
hardware requirements needed to run this

1516
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,400
and uh embracing risk assessment on that

1517
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,520
uh as you get more people who work

1518
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,000
with more develop developed quantum

1519
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,400
computing systems do you think that new

1520
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,400
algorithms could be created in the next

1521
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,800
few years that will create dramatically

1522
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,559
different risk scenarios

1523
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,359
okay i think the new quantum algorithms

1524
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,440
are coming right i think the paraphrase

1525
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,520
is that we have uh shore's algorithm

1526
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,960
with grover's algorithm there could be

1527
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,280
more quantum algorithms that could do

1528
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,720
yet more damage

1529
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,960
what do you guys think

1530
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,480
certainly could be

1531
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,760
i mean

1532
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,079
um i

1533
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,200
you know as part of every submission to

1534
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,280
the nist competition you had to do both

1535
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,680
classical and quantum analysis

1536
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,559
and

1537
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,960
it's clear that we still have debates

1538
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,400
among the community about how to

1539
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,359
actually

1540
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,119
measure some of those quantum algorithms

1541
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,720
not only in terms of number of qubits

1542
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,280
but circuit depth and things like that

1543
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,119
it's certainly possible that we'll see

1544
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,760
you know new quantum algorithms as that

1545
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,680
field grows

1546
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,160
that could provide better attacks than

1547
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,640
the ones that we know today

1548
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,839
i don't think that would be any

1549
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,040
different in the situation where with

1550
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,160
classical photography right

1551
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:26,240
okay yeah should i move another question

1552
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,400
yes we got another question from twitter

1553
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,119
uh in practice we sometimes need to go

1554
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,559
beyond plain cams and vanilla signatures

1555
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:35,920
would has

1556
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,720
would would that be at odds with agility

1557
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,720
or is agility actually required when

1558
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,118
supporting advanced protocols

1559
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,119
i'm not quite sure i understood

1560
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,520
um let's read it again

1561
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,640
if uh

1562
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,799
you are trying to deploy uh the way that

1563
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,000
i understand the question if you are

1564
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,240
trying to deploy advanced protocols then

1565
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,040
is when you need more agility

1566
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,160
or is agility at all with uh advanced

1567
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,559
protocols right by advanced protocols i

1568
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:09,520
think

1569
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,720
the question

1570
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,559
implies something more than chems and

1571
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,240
signatures it means the other stuff

1572
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,480
maybe talking about like thresholds or

1573
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,000
doing multi-party computation or

1574
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,839
something like that that kind of thing

1575
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,440
which certainly you would have agility

1576
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,760
needs for as well and you would want to

1577
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,960
be able to

1578
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,640
uh select different algorithms based on

1579
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,119
what you're doing i could see sure

1580
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,559
yeah that would be my answer my quick

1581
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,000
answer that's what i i'd observe on that

1582
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,920
that uh if you want to do those advanced

1583
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,400
algorithms i mean is it am i wrong to

1584
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,319
say that lattices are the only show in

1585
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,558
town

1586
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,520
maybe maybe i think there are some

1587
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,960
advanced schemes that need different

1588
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,720
properties so

1589
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,160
you know things like zero knowledge

1590
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,760
proofs and

1591
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,520
certain homomorphic things very

1592
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,280
comfortable in the lattice domain but i

1593
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,640
think there are other

1594
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,160
there are other advanced constructs

1595
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,119
which

1596
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,040
have yet to be looked at so

1597
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,119
i think this is going to be one of the

1598
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,160
um the interesting aspects what it takes

1599
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,319
now to make all of the things

1600
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,640
created with basic building blocks and

1601
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,240
to understand

1602
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,880
um the practicality the quantum safety

1603
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,720
etcetera etcetera etcetera i mean it's

1604
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,640
been hard enough for a lot of advanced

1605
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,559
schemes to actually get them rolled out

1606
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,720
due to complexity so so i think the

1607
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,960
answer with agility is

1608
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,960
depends on your definition definition of

1609
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,760
agility but but i think without agility

1610
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,599
you know these advanced protocols anyway

1611
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,599
have a have a um

1612
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,480
a problem being used um and so i think

1613
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,079
it just becomes part of the equation

1614
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,000
just gets a little bit more difficult

1615
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,880
just because um these new basic building

1616
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,400
blocks are very different than the ones

1617
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,680
we're used to

1618
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,040
and that we're used to building advanced

1619
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,680
schemes with

1620
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,480
can i just use this question to actually

1621
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,359
highlight an upcoming problem which is

1622
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,359
basically the lack of efficient

1623
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:01,680
constructions to many uh sophisticated

1624
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,200
crypto protocols

1625
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,599
because as we know the nspc competition

1626
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,920
covers what's really the main ingredient

1627
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,520
scan digital signature symmetric

1628
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,760
encryption but we do have many

1629
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,920
applications in the industry which

1630
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,839
require for example group signatures

1631
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,880
ring signatures uh oblivious transfer uh

1632
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,520
opr and many other constructions that

1633
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,160
i'm not quite sure there is enough or or

1634
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,000
maybe we should promote more the

1635
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,400
research in these areas because it could

1636
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,920
be a really big problem for the industry

1637
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,280
to turn off some features or systems

1638
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,960
because we don't have uh practical

1639
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,760
replacement in the pqc world

1640
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,480
yeah yeah thanks that's a good point

1641
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,520
francisco we got one more question

1642
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,920
um uh his uh

1643
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,480
address to uh mike osborne and he's

1644
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,640
again from mike vermeer

1645
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,000
uh so he he's asking mike osborne

1646
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,760
mentioned other emerging computing

1647
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,079
technologies that could be a threat to

1648
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,359
crypto like neuromorphic computing could

1649
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:03,119
you give more details or more examples

1650
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,040
of these other emerging computing

1651
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,200
technologies that could be over the

1652
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,359
horizon

1653
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:10,799
um i mean if you look at memory

1654
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:12,960
computation so so a lot of the modeling

1655
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,359
of some of the security properties make

1656
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,920
assumption on how

1657
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,079
on memory access things like this so if

1658
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,599
you now actually bring computation into

1659
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:22,559
memory

1660
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,079
things change in terms of those

1661
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:26,319
calculations if you look at neuromorphic

1662
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,000
computing this is uh

1663
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,359
i'm not an expert on but it's an area

1664
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,839
that's very um driven certainly in

1665
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,400
europe this is essentially modeling

1666
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,079
architectures that model you know how

1667
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,240
the brain works in terms of um

1668
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,760
connectivity

1669
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,520
um i can't remember the other thing that

1670
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,480
i said but the other the other

1671
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,079
interesting area of course on the

1672
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,079
assumption that um

1673
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,000
the the quantum computers will scale

1674
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,880
there's a tremendous amount of work

1675
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,000
in

1676
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,119
um

1677
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,640
in in advancing ai on

1678
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,040
quantum ai i would call it and so we're

1679
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,400
seeing starting to see a lot of very

1680
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,040
interesting research directions on

1681
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,960
using um ai per se to um

1682
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,440
to to to attack crypto so

1683
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,079
um just just a handful of examples of

1684
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,480
new technologies which um mean we have

1685
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,799
to keep looking uh we have to keep our

1686
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,720
eyes open we have to keep researching

1687
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,280
and keep keep this pipeline of of

1688
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,520
research going such that we always have

1689
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,280
you know something there kind of like

1690
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,200
ready for whatever new technology comes

1691
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:33,839
along right any more questions there

1692
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:38,680
francisco yeah one more okay

1693
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,839
and of course we welcome questions from

1694
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:51,599
the floor here if you want to talk to

1695
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,240
the microphone

1696
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,160
let's turn on the mic here

1697
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,799
no now it's fine okay yeah so i have

1698
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:11,119
heard in the previous uh session and

1699
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,559
this lesson that

1700
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,160
there are multiple industries which are

1701
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,760
still using des

1702
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,640
so

1703
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,040
now let's say uh

1704
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,440
you are deploying some pqc algorithm and

1705
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,119
after 20 years someone comes up with an

1706
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,160
attack

1707
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,280
so how easy or difficult would be for

1708
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,559
you to

1709
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,480
like at that time replace it with some

1710
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,200
other algorithm or migrate to something

1711
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,359
else

1712
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,599
what did you say it was used yes i i'm

1713
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,359
not sure so i mean uh

1714
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,760
so there are some industries which are

1715
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,760
still using ds and they could not

1716
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,119
migrate it to

1717
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,119
like the new one so

1718
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,359
let's say you are deploying one pqc

1719
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:51,599
algorithm right now after the

1720
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,000
competition is over and after 20 or 25

1721
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,839
years someone came up with an attack

1722
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,960
then how easy or difficult would it be

1723
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,160
it would be to

1724
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,680
like migrate it to something else

1725
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,480
if i understood your question i think

1726
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,319
this is all about crypto agility yeah i

1727
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,559
think we need to have systems that we

1728
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,559
can quickly switch crypt algorithms i

1729
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:13,920
think this could solve

1730
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,480
quite significantly uh this problem

1731
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,760
um

1732
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,599
so yeah i would say that cryptogenic is

1733
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,359
probably the main ingredient we need to

1734
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,599
create systems since the early design

1735
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,200
with the idea that we may need to

1736
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,520
replace the crypto algorithms hopefully

1737
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,200
we've not so much of urgency but uh but

1738
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,799
i think the systems need to be designed

1739
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,920
with that in mind so i expect it would

1740
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,359
not be similar to ds right

1741
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:40,319
sorry

1742
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:43,440
so it would not be the same case like d

1743
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,640
is

1744
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,000
a yes uh d yes d s

1745
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,160
uh yes i mean like we need to react

1746
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,160
quickly for sure we learned this lesson

1747
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,839
like we know that even there are some

1748
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,240
applications still based on md5

1749
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,160
sha-1

1750
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,839
i'm not speaking about google i'm

1751
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,160
speaking in general and this shows like

1752
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,839
how much time we need for for the

1753
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:05,839
transition mostly due to the problems

1754
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:07,280
with the systems they are not crypto

1755
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,520
agile so i think by having systems that

1756
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,039
are crypto agile this would help us

1757
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:13,039
quite a lot

1758
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,559
yeah let me make one comment because i

1759
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,160
think part of what you're highlighting

1760
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,240
is the fact that there are certain

1761
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,880
systems in certain industries where even

1762
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,240
though we've known des as a week for a

1763
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,839
long time they have still not moved off

1764
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:24,720
of it

1765
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,480
uh i often hear this from certain

1766
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,079
financial institutions that are still

1767
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,400
using des in back end

1768
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,480
you know within their closed networks

1769
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,440
and

1770
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,880
that's what's in the hardware and they

1771
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,760
can't kind of update from it um

1772
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,319
so a that's certainly a concern

1773
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:41,119
um

1774
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:42,720
and i have had other financial

1775
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,079
institutions who have said to me hey we

1776
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,160
just moved to windows 7 aren't we great

1777
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,039
so you know it takes time okay and this

1778
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,000
is true

1779
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,119
in particular for critical

1780
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,200
infrastructure systems where you may

1781
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,359
only have an opportunity to update the

1782
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,440
cryptography every 15 to 20 years when

1783
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,760
you replace hardware and if you miss

1784
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,520
that window you're using what you're

1785
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,119
what you're using

1786
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,160
now

1787
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,400
one of the potential solutions for that

1788
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,760
is to actually

1789
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,319
add layers of post quantum protection as

1790
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,640
a wrapper around the initial protocol

1791
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,920
you could do this

1792
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,720
with effectively doing vpn endpoints in

1793
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,960
between a channel that's still say using

1794
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,160
des and can't update and so we may see

1795
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,160
a lot of use in some of these systems

1796
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,160
where you cannot change the underlying

1797
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,480
implementations but you add a wrapping

1798
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,160
layer that's independent to kind of add

1799
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,920
on the pq protection

1800
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,920
okay so i think that's another way to

1801
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,880
but certainly we all hope that when

1802
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,480
the pq algorithms are as old as des are

1803
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,559
that um we'll all have a lot of agility

1804
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:43,520
in the system we just change the

1805
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,599
configuration somewhere and everything

1806
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,839
magically moves to a new hour

1807
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,760
i'd love to live to see that day thank

1808
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,440
you

1809
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,599
maybe just a quick point because i think

1810
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,000
it's uh it's a point which make actually

1811
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,920
um migrating difficult and that there's

1812
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,200
a lot of use

1813
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,000
of things like des and char and md5

1814
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,799
which are not a quantum problem at all

1815
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,760
it because um at the moment we have

1816
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,440
we only worry about passive attacks

1817
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,680
where things can be harvested or or

1818
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,520
collected and somehow

1819
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,319
attacked offline we are not now worried

1820
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,359
about

1821
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:19,839
active attacks where where your

1822
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,079
adversary is is an online quantum

1823
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,200
computer

1824
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,400
um so so actually figuring out of all of

1825
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,160
the out all of the instances where we

1826
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,960
have used classical crypto which are the

1827
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,640
ones which are critical this is this is

1828
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,760
a bit um

1829
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,520
a challenge the industry has right now

1830
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,720
because it's not all critical md5 used

1831
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,280
for for lookups or for for other things

1832
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,319
is not a problem so it's uh it's kind of

1833
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,480
having the right strategy to really be

1834
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,960
sure very clear about the sort of

1835
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,799
quantum threat you're addressing and

1836
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,760
then to identify those instances that an

1837
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,760
attacker can get the artifacts they need

1838
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,079
to run the attack and the data they need

1839
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:00,160
to run the attack

1840
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,720
actually means it's kind of

1841
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,200
it's really not a problem to carry on

1842
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,520
using some of the uh some of the the

1843
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,680
crypto that we have today i mean

1844
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,280
that's going to sound funny because i

1845
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,559
think in the end it's better that we all

1846
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,480
move to new cryptography because the

1847
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,520
next time we do a a crypto migration

1848
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,480
then we're going to have four

1849
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,079
generations of crypto that we have to

1850
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:22,319
figure out why why is that still there

1851
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,400
is it okay in that context to use et

1852
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,799
cetera et cetera so i really hope that

1853
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:29,200
the quantum threat gives us

1854
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,480
a

1855
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,799
the excuse to actually uh think about

1856
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:35,039
doing uh cryptography properly and

1857
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,599
clearing up a bit the um that the mess

1858
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,000
that we have now

1859
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,200
well yeah

1860
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,880
thanks mike

1861
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,799
okay i think uh i think we're basically

1862
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,799
out of time i think oh wait a minute

1863
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:49,119
sorry oh sorry didn't see you there okay

1864
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,280
right question from the floor

1865
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,440
yeah then we're closed um thanks for

1866
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,200
this discussion it's really important um

1867
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,880
at the same time it feels like we're

1868
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,799
still in the science project stage right

1869
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,720
we're all everybody's doing things and

1870
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,599
we have little pieces of

1871
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,359
interoperability and then we're waiting

1872
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,039
for this to finalize at least the you

1873
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,799
know the round three uh algorithms

1874
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:08,880
before we can say okay we can like put

1875
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,640
it into the standards and have you know

1876
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,280
end-to-end interoperability um you know

1877
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,520
to do anything at this point in in

1878
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,280
commercial industry is so difficult

1879
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,039
because you have to rely on three or

1880
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:20,799
four different software stacks hsn

1881
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,200
vendors and you know ca providers

1882
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,200
integrating and we don't even have like

1883
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,720
settled on hybrid we're talking about a

1884
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,160
lot of different mechanisms and they all

1885
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,000
can work really well but i mean trying

1886
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,400
to pick one through this morass when we

1887
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,039
don't even have anything final yet so my

1888
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:36,480
question is what do we do in the

1889
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,079
meantime like what can we do now to

1890
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:40,480
prepare for standardizations and what

1891
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,160
what is what are good things for teams

1892
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,079
development teams to focus on to get

1893
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:44,960
ready

1894
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,880
that makes sense yeah no we're in a

1895
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,240
difficult position we're on the cost of

1896
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,720
change and managing that cusp is is

1897
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,200
going to be hard guys

1898
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,280
you can just mention what i what what i

1899
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,119
already said in the beginning was about

1900
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:59,520
the crypto inventory which is finding

1901
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,559
where you're using classical

1902
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,520
cryptography it's a very tricky task in

1903
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,200
large organizations and this can be done

1904
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,599
right away i hope that most large

1905
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,039
organizations are already working on

1906
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:09,920
that

1907
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,440
now another thing is there are some

1908
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,280
situation use case

1909
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,960
where you don't necessarily need to

1910
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,799
follow a standard because for example

1911
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,280
you have if you have in um in transit

1912
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,760
encryption where you control both ends

1913
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,400
you can just add a pqc layer now

1914
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,599
even though it's not the final algorithm

1915
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,680
and eventually when the

1916
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,680
final cam is published you can easily

1917
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,920
switch without major problems so there

1918
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,000
are a few things we can do right now

1919
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,640
even though we don't have the standards

1920
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,680
yeah let me just add to raphael's point

1921
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,920
when you do that when when you use an

1922
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,119
enterprise or doing an inventory what

1923
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:46,880
cryptography you use

1924
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,039
an important point on that and and then

1925
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:50,960
nccoe project description talks about

1926
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,240
some of this as well so i would also

1927
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,680
refer you to that

1928
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,440
um it's important to know who actually

1929
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,880
owns the implementation of that

1930
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,960
cryptography that you depend upon and

1931
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,280
what are their migration plans and then

1932
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,880
the other thing that i so those are all

1933
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,799
fair questions asked and the other thing

1934
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:06,480
i tell customers who come into microsoft

1935
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,280
is

1936
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,720
if you are writing a request for

1937
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,240
proposals right now if you're putting

1938
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,680
out a bid if you're architecting

1939
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,000
something now it is a fair question to

1940
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,839
your vendors to say what are your pqc

1941
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,399
migration plans and if and anything that

1942
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:20,640
gets bid on or at least you know where

1943
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,040
you're getting a proposal for something

1944
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,359
there better be a pqc transition part of

1945
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:28,399
that right or or it's just it's specked

1946
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,799
as you've got to have the pqc algorithms

1947
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:32,158
along the way

1948
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:33,439
right

1949
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,040
we don't want to keep we need to stop

1950
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,759
digging the hole deeper right and so we

1951
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,000
shouldn't be procuring new systems today

1952
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,600
that don't have

1953
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,679
a migration or a transition plan as part

1954
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,198
of them and we shouldn't be designing

1955
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:47,520
new systems and shipping new apis

1956
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,759
that don't have sufficient agility built

1957
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:50,640
in

1958
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,960
okay thanks brian i think we'll we'll

1959
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,120
have to wrap it up there again i'd like

1960
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,560
to thank the panelists it'd be great to

1961
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,120
get you all back in 2030 and see how all

1962
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,799
this pans out

1963
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,920
because

1964
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,600
the future does look

1965
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,439
unpredictable uh

1966
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:08,319
spoiler said so that's it thank you all

1967
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:11,920
and we bring this session to our club

1968
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,679
thank you very much we will have our

1969
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,600
lunch break now

1970
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,479
and see you for the third round table

1971
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:26,799
afterwards thank you atleans thank you

1972
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:31,158
mike bye thank you

1973
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,640
you
