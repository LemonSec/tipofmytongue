1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,159
please

2
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,050
[Music]

3
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,620
um

4
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,939
okay

5
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,039
oh we have to clear this up

6
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,740
okay

7
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,159
so um our first speaker is Young Rock

8
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,560
Joe who's speaking on cryptographic hash

9
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,619
functions based on Arc transitive graphs

10
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,460
okay thank you for the organization of

11
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,280
the opportunity I'm young Cho and this

12
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,560
research is the co-work with shohei

13
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,659
satake

14
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,640
for the beginning we introduced a

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,100
cryptographic hash function

16
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,100
the cryptographic hash function is a

17
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,079
fundamental primitive in a variety of

18
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,020
using cryptography the hash function is

19
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,960
to Maple text of arbitrary size to fifth

20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,100
size of values when constructing a hash

21
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,840
function it requires some conditions

22
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,380
with computational if infeasibility

23
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,899
first one is when we need which means

24
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,060
that for a given hash value it is hard

25
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,260
to find its premise secondly it is hard

26
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,940
to compute the colliding hash value

27
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,580
which has distinct pre-images we call it

28
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,480
Collision resistance for a given text if

29
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,520
it is hard to compute the colliding free

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,560
image then we call it strong Collision

31
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,440
resistance or second premium register

32
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,400
these hashing processes should be

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,560
computationally efficient and also

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,900
distributed hash values in a based

35
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,940
uniformly

36
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,400
we hope to construct the hash function

37
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,440
from a graph

38
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,319
and Pitch security mostly relies on the

39
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,260
hardness of binding of path assigned

40
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,620
from the from the given message for an

41
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,500
example we consider it on a cubic graph

42
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,540
which is three ligament graph each

43
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,000
vertex has a three tables and we assume

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,580
that we we take a message over length of

45
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,480
C

46
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,420
and we also see the initial vertex

47
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,420
now we have a proper uh mapping from a

48
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,760
message to the loaded Edge

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,780
then we work on a given graph as

50
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,280
oh so the first video is one and the

51
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,379
second one is one and zero and and so on

52
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,819
then then finally we reach it the

53
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,560
terminal vertex it became a hash

54
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,120
valuable of a given message

55
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,440
there are many triers to construct the

56
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,959
graph or group based hash function this

57
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,780
is the timeline of both triers

58
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,420
the first suggestion is from General in

59
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,959
191 it hashes finally beats to two

60
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,459
matrices G1 and G2 over Prime field

61
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,220
these these two matrices really then it

62
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,519
generates a special linear group the

63
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,519
hashabilities or product products of the

64
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,840
sequences consisting of G1 and G2

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,659
however the more team is broken by the

66
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,420
more and series using the lifting attack

67
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,360
they modify that the generators and base

68
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,739
Fields as F2 to the n

69
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:19,560
and here x is a root of the defining

70
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,220
polynomial of F2 to the n

71
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,100
in 2006 Charles Gordon and rotter

72
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,900
suggest the hash function based on

73
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,940
laman's and graph

74
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,280
there are two kinds of Romans and crafts

75
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,320
and one is based on roboticophilic

76
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,759
sardonark

77
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,840
grass and oblivi it has an LPS graph and

78
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,419
the other is based on a title to Amazon

79
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,240
graph and which became an essential idea

80
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,360
for super singular isogenic DPM key

81
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,000
exchange even though in recent many crit

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
analytic attempts against the side are

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,600
rebuilt it is still affected severe hash

84
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,699
function probably isogen is a

85
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,320
cryptography with variants of

86
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,120
applications

87
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,539
and last year inclusive at all also just

88
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,340
the Hashi function based on the mark of

89
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,320
triple

90
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,660
unfortunately most of the hash functions

91
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,360
are known vulnerable by specific attacks

92
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,580
but these attacks are somehow in a

93
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,960
heuristic way

94
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,919
if we change the generator G1 Prime as a

95
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,979
G1 dollar Prime then we still don't know

96
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,520
how to attack

97
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,620
security over most of these systems

98
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,900
relies on the hardness of assumptions to

99
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,960
find the passive in graph to reduce this

100
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
group word problem in case kilogram or

101
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,619
direct graph

102
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,660
finding a collision is equivalent to

103
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,300
find a cycle in a given given graph so

104
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,000
we want to guarantee the shortest cycle

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,220
is large enough

106
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,319
here we are trying to suggest the uses

107
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,080
of a triplet and 50 graph which also

108
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,139
seen as architective graphs with large

109
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,180
guards

110
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,000
we also consider the expansion property

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,340
with the second largest eigenvalue which

112
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,940
guarantee that mixing the hash value it

113
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,680
also concerns the expecting level it's

114
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,800
not a fiber type graphs

115
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,800
additionally it is possible to provide

116
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,500
some useful properties as a primitive

117
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,680
the scalability means we can control the

118
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,840
size of output as demanded

119
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,819
and through a modification property

120
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,979
means that if there are any modification

121
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,100
in a text then it should affect its hash

122
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,440
value

123
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,880
concatenation property means in other

124
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,860
words we say homomorphic hash function

125
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,880
it allows us to compute in parallel and

126
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,100
in recent we also noticed that these

127
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,800
woman functions can be a mini critical

128
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,380
primitive

129
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,080
now we will prepare some knowledge for

130
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,680
suggesting a new hash function based on

131
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,340
arc-20 graph

132
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,580
so an Sr Global gamma is a sequence of f

133
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,180
plus one number of vertices any two

134
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,699
consecutive

135
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,740
any two consecutive or vertices in the

136
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,080
sequence are adjacent and with any

137
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,840
repeated vertices being more than two

138
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,500
steps apart

139
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,039
our transitive graph is the Automotive

140
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,819
Group at the trends to the L only

141
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:33,120
Sr not on an S Plus One Arc

142
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,240
so in figure it is a three Arc Trinity

143
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,940
and we call it the uh Patterson graph

144
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,240
and every directive three edges passes

145
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,099
in in the graph can be transformed into

146
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,520
any other such path

147
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,879
and here is a factor so the gamma is D

148
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,639
plus one regular graph which is the

149
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,080
socket Trinity

150
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,680
so it you have this figures and if you

151
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,599
dialect it it looks like dialectical

152
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,900
path and then there exists that these

153
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,020
things are automorphism

154
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,800
t t numbers of the automorphism

155
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,860
uh t plus one automorphism and we call

156
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,280
it the uh shunt Automotive

157
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,660
and

158
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,960
so these are the picture and also the

159
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,840
subgroup of this G which is generated by

160
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,720
this extent Automotive at some uh set of

161
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,020
Sr trenditively

162
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,419
so now we prefer the hash function from

163
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,559
an sr20t graph we have a d regular a

164
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,620
deeper one regular

165
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,059
sr20t graph

166
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,779
we first fix on SRP and the end vertex

167
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,880
freezer is the initial vertex

168
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,100
and there are D numbers of the shunt

169
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,860
automorphism and we fully assign them

170
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,380
each Theory have to be to the shunt

171
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,100
automorphism

172
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,600
and now we have a theory message

173
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,300
messages and we work on a graph with the

174
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,320
shunted S Arc by assigned automorphism

175
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,080
first x0 gives shunt automorphism loaded

176
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,019
by x0 and the initial vertex are sliding

177
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,320
to the vertex P1 and which is the end

178
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,580
vertex next chanted s Arc

179
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,399
professively we compute the process here

180
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,320
for proper work we should Define the

181
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,680
composite of automorphism and inverse in

182
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,140
order to back and forth to move vertex

183
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,420
one by one so the details are quite

184
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,660
complicated so we equate it to our paper

185
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,360
unless we we have a hash value as a

186
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,680
terminal vertex

187
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,660
now we discuss about the Collision

188
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,279
resistancy

189
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,860
here we claim the finding a collision

190
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,580
which is equivalent to finding a cycle

191
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,880
in a given brand comma

192
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,459
so there is a two conditions and the

193
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,459
first one is there is no short cycle in

194
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:06,060
gamma and this can be verified if the

195
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,720
shortest shortest cycle you know come uh

196
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,000
the draft is large enough

197
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,660
and also the second condition the

198
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,959
finding a cycle or a close work

199
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:21,420
containing containing the initial vertex

200
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,180
P0 in gamma which is a computation

201
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,519
computational invisible

202
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,839
so to guarantee this claim we uh we

203
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,660
introduce the group word group word

204
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,579
problem and which must be uh infeasible

205
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,519
so to guarantee this second condition so

206
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,320
the following problem must be invisible

207
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,720
here that g is the final finite group

208
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,680
with the identity which is denoted by I

209
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,540
ID and S is a generating set of G and

210
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,700
this is we have the numbers of

211
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,980
generating generators

212
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,000
and the representation problem is there

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,940
is a for a given length l i find the

214
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,320
word uh W the angling set and most L and

215
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,440
which is 30 to satisfying the word or

216
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,820
the product of this word is identity

217
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,820
and here the word is reduced

218
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
the balance problem means so we have a

219
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,380
given length of L and find two distinct

220
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,040
words W and W Prime of length and most L

221
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,920
which is equal

222
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,399
and both are reduced so

223
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,339
by mixing or correct paper one can

224
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,380
construct a cycle from the solution of

225
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,660
representation in a balance problem

226
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,680
now we we want to compare the uh KD hash

227
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,579
function

228
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:59,579
you know in a sense of the size or

229
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,700
underlying groups and which is the uh

230
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,339
corresponding soil talent and

231
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,440
representation problems

232
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,740
so KD hash function means this we uh

233
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,500
there is a hash function from a Kaylee

234
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,200
class and the size of the growth is uh

235
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,579
determined by the order of this group

236
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:27,300
and our proposing hash it has there is a

237
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,940
stabilizer of the perfect any purchasing

238
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,320
graph and which is uh acting on a set of

239
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,959
r s r transitively

240
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,079
and so in here the N is the size of hash

241
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,040
value space then a Kelly Hashi in in a

242
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,200
case of KD hashing the hash Valley space

243
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,200
is like uh you get the same as a

244
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,180
cardinality of this group

245
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,540
but our proposed hash is has uh which is

246
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,860
the uh the cardinality of this uh given

247
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,700
group over the state the cardinality of

248
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,440
stabilizers

249
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,399
so if we want if you want to set up some

250
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,339
text I had to fix the size of the hash

251
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,459
valid space then we we should take the

252
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,519
more larger group then we can make the

253
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,540
more complexity

254
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,920
and we give a split as enemies of Arc

255
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,019
Trinity Credit

256
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:32,100
we give some notation and pg1p is the

257
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,380
projective

258
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,600
projective line over finite field with

259
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,160
infinity

260
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,579
and pgl is the productive General linear

261
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:42,779
group

262
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:46,079
and so then we know the PGA acts sharply

263
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,500
return the timely on the projected line

264
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,000
because we can see there is a linear

265
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,740
fractional transformation between pgl

266
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,680
and the projective line

267
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,440
on press projected line at the

268
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,380
we defined on duet and if it is the

269
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,459
unordered pair and triplet uh

270
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,740
I'm sorry as if we see that on all the

271
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,959
pair and we we Define The Crossing ratio

272
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,480
which is the number of a list of four

273
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,720
core linear coins on projective line so

274
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,240
in figure there are two sets of Four

275
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,820
Points X1 through X4 and X1 Prime

276
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,180
and they are crossing ratio is r equal

277
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,800
so especially if it is -1 then

278
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,380
we call them harmonic conjugate

279
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,220
so now we we want to define a triplet

280
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,160
graph and here we need some more

281
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,480
notations

282
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,500
on productivity on productive line so

283
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,440
we Define a quartet which is an ordered

284
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,019
pair of Duets and which are harmonic

285
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,300
conjugate so the crossing ratio of this

286
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,579
is -1

287
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:09,480
and triplet is the set of three points

288
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,720
so the vertex of the three click correct

289
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,420
graph is or trickling so you can choose

290
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,100
or we can choose the three subjects

291
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,740
among a t plus one set

292
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,800
and the adjacency between the triplets

293
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,019
is

294
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:29,639
defined like this

295
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,680
and two three please have common two

296
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,699
points and then it's intersection and

297
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:38,459
symmetric difference are also 2X and if

298
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,420
they are harm Harmony conjugate then and

299
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,319
they are organization

300
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,380
so

301
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,240
we uh we want to only consider the

302
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,380
connected triplet graph and so we uh

303
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,779
considered only one component in

304
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:01,920
containing the vertex t zero

305
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,459
then in fact if we are controller if we

306
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:09,480
set up the p is one module 4 and which

307
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,540
is a prime number 10 triplet triplet

308
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,420
always has a two isomorphic components

309
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,240
so we only uh select the one component

310
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,480
containing this vertex in here

311
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,820
and the number of the these vertex is

312
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,540
appropriately p and p to the third and

313
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,720
and this TP is a two Arc Trinity

314
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,300
so in figure

315
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,120
this is also about Peterson graph and if

316
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,720
we choose p is equal to 5 then we have a

317
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,600
two isomorphic components but uh we only

318
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,820
consider the one component about this

319
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,259
containing this vertex t 0

320
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,680
and as mentioned before so by linear

321
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,199
fractional transformation we can

322
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,839
describe the shunt automorphism as two

323
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,779
metrics A and B like this

324
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,199
okay

325
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,959
oh I'm sorry

326
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,780
wow Mark function

327
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,000
okay now we give a definition of effect

328
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,059
so the reminder the definition of

329
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,220
quartet so the

330
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,220
situated the pair of the viewers are

331
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,760
Harmon conjugate and sex that means we

332
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,820
have an unordered cheaper a triple of

333
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,679
the duet and

334
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,940
uh these three

335
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,900
four point set is our quartet then we uh

336
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,380
this uh three probabilities uh we

337
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,140
defined it uh test that

338
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,580
and the vertices all fixed it and we

339
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,100
assume the p is equal to one module

340
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,840
eight

341
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,780
and this is relation is a little bit uh

342
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,460
tricky so we consider the uh

343
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,320
260 x and y and these are positioned if

344
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,919
each duet needs one side here in y

345
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,940
uh fifth point of the involution of Q

346
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,419
and R and S and here QR and S are all

347
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,940
combination settled to do it in X

348
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,960
excluding the common or X so we will

349
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,200
give you some details

350
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,160
explanation

351
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,220
so these six steps have a one comment to

352
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,059
it

353
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:40,160
with each other so in here F0

354
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,299
we have a f x 1 and X2 and here X1 and

355
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:49,440
F2 is a Common Thread and here X3 X4 is

356
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,340
common

357
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,760
and 0 and 3 is the third one is common

358
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,679
to it

359
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,460
and we consider the

360
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,780
uh

361
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,000
we only consider the decimalation or

362
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,580
this is consideration so from here we

363
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,280
consider all combination of core Four

364
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,520
Points without this duet and X is three

365
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,900
and F4 and S4 is 5 that's 6.

366
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,820
then it is on Q and this is the quartet

367
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,100
we already know because we started from

368
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,799
sector zero and which is already by

369
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,799
definition important but uh the other

370
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,980
combination combination of R and S is

371
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,860
not quartet so we we want to find out

372
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,559
this kind of quartet by defining each

373
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:43,559
involution and we figure out that fixed

374
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,240
point of this evolution

375
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,140
and there is a new uh duet and these are

376
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,100
amazingly these are the consists of

377
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,799
fixed it so in this way we can call

378
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:59,580
resistances here and we here and we find

379
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,559
that this process then we can find the

380
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,500
assisted adjacency relation

381
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,900
and just take care

382
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,059
so in order to represent the automotive

383
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,419
automorphism will stick whatever we need

384
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,900
some data in this generator so we

385
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,280
suppose p is uh one module 16 and if it

386
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,600
is the Prime power

387
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,720
uh oh I'm sorry this is not the front

388
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,299
part what is TI P just a prime number

389
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,539
and sigma is a primitive or a scoot of

390
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:31,919
unity

391
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,820
and FP is the component of this uh

392
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,880
system containing the this initial

393
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,140
vertex

394
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,260
and CD and enchant Auto marketable ft

395
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,919
and then uh in PSL so we have this

396
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,000
simple point of view in

397
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,919
projective especially new growth

398
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,919
and then the fact is that the safety

399
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,140
grip is non-biperite cubic or three

400
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,900
regular breath and the numbers of these

401
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,600
vertices are approximately P to the

402
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,620
Third and s is 4x20p

403
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,120
so if proposed has would have no short

404
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,840
Collision which is derived from the

405
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,059
information of occurs and N is the

406
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,340
number of the vertices in the curse of

407
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,299
the triplet is bounded by this number

408
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:29,659
and for any cubic graph with girth is

409
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:32,640
equal to log n

410
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,700
and this is the conjecture for in a case

411
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,460
of a safety graph and daily us from a

412
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,440
constant C and so comparing the to the

413
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,880
other extent uh the other graphs and the

414
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,220
cursor will choose numbers and graph it

415
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,400
has a D Spot the two two numbers means

416
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,799
uh there is a three regular version of

417
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,720
the loop of Wikipedia column address

418
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,200
and on the on the other hand in first

419
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,520
tech classes

420
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,620
numerical readers suggest that you see

421
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,419
uh larger than this is custom

422
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,299
and we also uh proved that triplet and

423
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,580
effective are families of expander with

424
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,799
some constant smaller than three

425
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,140
and we also show that two groups are not

426
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,179
a kilogram

427
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,400
so now we give out some possible attacks

428
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,900
on the purpose and problem performances

429
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,860
so the underlying group is uh

430
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,440
of the of group what

431
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,980
and Gamma e so when we consider tricklet

432
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,220
and the group is

433
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,640
generated by this A and B matrices and

434
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,220
which is like equivalent to a project

435
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,960
especially

436
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,980
and also uh in the sector case also the

437
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,200
sigma is the Primitive of each root of

438
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,200
unity and the genetic generating by this

439
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,260
C and D then it becomes protective

440
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,500
special

441
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,900
so possible.text we we are dealing on

442
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,020
Center automation ABCD and HK for each

443
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,840
case and N is the size of a hash valid

444
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,559
state

445
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,799
and generally uh in a first day of

446
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,960
Tekken and the romance attack can be

447
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,539
applied and if it is um

448
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:25,679
operated in scale root n

449
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,760
and we also consider the subgroup attack

450
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,220
features related to the balance problem

451
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,640
in our case and lifting attack with this

452
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,159
related representation problem

453
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,480
and so for again the uh This Server

454
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,059
group of text there is a heuristic

455
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,380
attack

456
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,720
and uh

457
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,659
so Collision length is like this so

458
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,400
which is defined by a neural

459
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,039
and for this team attack uh

460
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,279
the electric graphs and so first the

461
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,620
suggestion over General they are

462
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,720
alternating set at anything number is

463
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,980
very similar to a very uh simulative or

464
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,260
A and B our for triplets

465
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,799
and but in General's case we can apply

466
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,140
the lifting attack from especially you

467
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,919
go to uh of over finite field to integer

468
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,159
stand and also we can use the euclidean

469
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,500
algorithm but you know okay we don't

470
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,880
know yet

471
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,659
and in six Tech graph uh so the lifting

472
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,460
attack is uh

473
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,799
which is a

474
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,799
algebra

475
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,559
and so we can uh randomly choose these

476
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,779
variables in X and Y or these two and

477
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:05,940
then we cannot apply the connection

478
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,039
algorithm

479
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,100
then we can find the factorization

480
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,320
but in in SEPTA graph we don't know how

481
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,500
to do it because actually there is some

482
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,200
information that about some Norm

483
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,980
equation in contain an algebra with of

484
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,980
for a safety Credit in twice and the

485
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,179
nomination is like this so for Collision

486
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:34,679
resistance so we for achieving 512 of

487
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,860
this security so the size of the hash

488
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,320
valid space should be uh due to the

489
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,080
1024 then we have to choose a piece if

490
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,059
peace approximately to to 342.

491
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,299
and performances so we set up the common

492
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:58,159
Prime and like this and basically is

493
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,140
satisfying the condition of each hash

494
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,179
function will reconsider the triplet

495
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:06,720
graphs and 50 graphs and and choose okay

496
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,159
hash function

497
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,100
so which is known so we compare the

498
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,580
performance this and for for prime

499
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,580
number P is which is this one and we

500
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,020
randomly sample the 300 text in our

501
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,200
length L which is uh 10 to the uh 10 000

502
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,760
bit

503
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,299
and we hashing it for text of the 10 000

504
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:33,419
bit the average time it's like this if

505
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:39,260
it is multiple okay Justice and uh

506
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,480
so now we are summary uh summary

507
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,200
summarize our work and we proposal you

508
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,080
have functions based on

509
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,120
opportunity graph and explicitly a

510
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,520
triplets and testicles which are

511
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,640
expanded with large cars and which is

512
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,220
also a higher component than to Hash

513
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,000
function

514
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,820
and the predictable attacks are all are

515
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,120
limitable and if it is related apparent

516
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,220
and representation problem

517
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,120
and now we have some open problem one is

518
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,299
confirming the conjunction conjecture of

519
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:22,380
the uh curve of the cystic correct and

520
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,419
also the over the security analysis to

521
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,559
be quite that's all

522
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,899
okay thank you very much thank you

523
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:39,439
speaker

524
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,220
so it's a very nice talk so would

525
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,380
anybody like to ask any questions

526
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,140
we can take questions both from zoom and

527
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,299
from the audience here the audience here

528
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,539
we're using

529
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,140
what's that

530
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,980
do we have any questions on Zoom

531
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,840
questions on Zoom

532
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,460
well I have a quick question

533
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,159
um I'm curious how difficult you think

534
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:12,480
it might be to come up with more

535
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,580
explicit examples

536
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,659
oh yes so we also considered are we also

537
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,840
search others some examples but it is

538
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,200
hard to find uh which has also the logic

539
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,039
Earth

540
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,659
so it is one of the

541
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:33,260
challenging problems in graph Theory so

542
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,200
so this this triplet graph and statistic

543
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,640
graph is actually it is uh uh suggested

544
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,500
in

545
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:48,000
1988 and in 92. so uh

546
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,620
but

547
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,640
we don't know about the further examples

548
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,960
yet we've we have a slightly different

549
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,220
other examples in in our in our paper

550
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,299
but uh which is not enough to or

551
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,940
construct the hash function for now

552
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,840
so we don't know yet the other examples

553
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,279
which has a logical

554
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,840
great thank you so let's thank our

555
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,080
thank you
