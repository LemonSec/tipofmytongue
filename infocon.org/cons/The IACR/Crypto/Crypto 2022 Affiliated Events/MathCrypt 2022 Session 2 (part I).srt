1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,039
foreign

2
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,680
in the front pocket

3
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,140
if you don't mind could you button your

4
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,840
top button yeah thank you just makes it

5
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,340
better I know I hope I'm not like

6
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,239
messing up your style

7
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,218
oh that's fine

8
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,420
hello hello

9
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,640
yes does it work you can hear me

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,640
um

11
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,220
and it'll be a lot better if you can

12
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,540
project your voice like you don't have a

13
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,200
microphone oh okay so everyone like yeah

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,119
like looking up exactly and then I'll

15
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,640
give you a withdrew on this laser

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,060
pointer

17
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,439
um

18
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,439
pretty simple forward backwards

19
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,740
um okay so the big green one I can do

20
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,399
those okay

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,240
also Point here if you can

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,240
thanks

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,439
I'm not going to know what you're

24
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,259
talking about but

25
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:53,520
I'm sure everyone else hopefully the

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,658
others do but yeah

27
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,340
all right I'm just going to yell one

28
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,460
more

29
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,099
foreign

30
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,319
welcome back to the afternoon session

31
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,940
uh or I guess it's not the afternoon

32
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,160
session

33
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,300
welcome back to the second morning

34
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,739
session

35
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,019
um so our next talk will be by Valerie

36
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,519
Gilchrist who's speaking on efficient

37
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,739
super Singularity testing over FP and

38
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,379
seaside key validation

39
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,480
okay thank you

40
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,920
um so yeah so as mentioned today we're

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,060
going to be talking about some super

42
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,400
Singularity tests uh and in particular

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,780
in the seaside context

44
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,860
okay so Seaside is an isogety-based

45
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,860
post-quantum uh non-interactive key

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,920
exchange scheme uh one thing about it is

47
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,959
that you can actually reuse the keys so

48
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,819
it makes key validation all the more

49
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,500
important

50
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,200
um in the seaside setting the public

51
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,840
keys are elliptic curves uh and in

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,159
particular they're going to be elliptic

53
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,500
Curves in what we call Montgomery form

54
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,060
and so the reason we use Montgomery form

55
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,580
or kind of one of the nice properties

56
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,560
as it reduces down to this one

57
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,480
coefficient just this element over FP

58
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,799
which we will call the Montgomery

59
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,180
coefficient

60
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,159
uh and so the main question and key

61
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,440
validation is does the corresponding

62
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,200
curve to this value of FP is it going to

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,599
be super singular or ordinary

64
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,019
so it's worth noting that most values a

65
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,879
that you take from FP will correspond to

66
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,099
ordinary curves so it is quite special

67
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,260
for a curve to be super singular

68
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,720
uh and so one of many definitions of

69
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,400
super Singularity that we can take is

70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,500
that the curve as defined over FP has P

71
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,060
plus one points

72
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,799
and so now the question is well how are

73
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,019
we going to check super singularity

74
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,340
So today we're going to look at four

75
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,659
algorithms

76
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,238
uh the first one we're looking at is

77
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,220
what we call the random Point test so

78
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,560
this algorithm was first introduced in

79
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,360
the original Seaside paper

80
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,639
and it's kind of the premise of it is

81
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,259
that it's looking for a point of order P

82
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:29,639
plus one

83
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,860
uh and so to do this it's first going to

84
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,419
use hassa's theorem to kind of take a

85
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:34,620
little bit of a shortcut

86
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,500
uh so due to hasses theorem we know that

87
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,660
if we can find a point of order n where

88
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,060
n is at least 4 root p and N divides P

89
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,340
plus 1 then actually the order of this

90
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,600
point is going to lie in this particular

91
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,639
interval and it ends up being that the

92
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,259
order will necessarily have to be P plus

93
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,900
one

94
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,520
uh and so one thing with this algorithm

95
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,320
that is a little bit of a drawback is

96
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,120
that you have to know the factorization

97
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,380
of p plus one

98
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,479
and so in Seaside this is actually fine

99
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,639
because P plus 1 is constructed in this

100
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,220
very specific way it's going to be this

101
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,199
product four times this product of small

102
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,780
primes l i

103
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,120
uh and so

104
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,919
we're gonna need the specific small

105
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,300
primes Li

106
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,860
and so in the algorithm we're going to

107
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,780
take this random Point P from the curve

108
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,460
as defined over FP

109
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,840
and we're going to compute the scalar

110
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,479
multiple multiple of it Qi where we're

111
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,660
Computing P plus 1 over l i times P for

112
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,639
one of these small Primes

113
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,780
and so what we're going to check with

114
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,419
each Qi is first that Qi itself is not

115
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,300
zero so that we can get a definitive

116
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,460
kind of answer here and then we're going

117
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,860
to check that Li times q i gives us zero

118
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,720
and if it does then we necessarily know

119
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,280
that Li is a divisor of n the order of P

120
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,100
uh we're also we can also check if Li

121
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,280
times Qi is zero or sorry is not zero

122
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,620
then this means that the order of P does

123
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,180
not divide P plus one and so our curve

124
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,979
is not too particular at all and so we

125
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,840
could terminate at that point

126
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,120
we're going to do this for enough Li so

127
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,699
that the product of the LI is at least 4

128
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,900
root p

129
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,440
okay so even if we do this in kind of a

130
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,699
smart way where we're choosing kind of

131
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,639
the largest Li first uh in for example

132
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,880
Seaside 512 where we have 74 small

133
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,800
primes this will equate to about 33

134
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,220
scalar multiplications so not super fast

135
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,080
but this actually does end up being

136
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,859
pretty good for memory

137
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,360
um a variation on this test which is the

138
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,979
implementation that's currently used in

139
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,800
C tide and like the seaside code is what

140
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,780
we call the product tree test so it has

141
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,400
the same premise kind of the same ideas

142
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,500
behind it but it takes advantage of the

143
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,940
fact that we're using a lot of the same

144
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,039
scalar multiplications

145
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,360
and so it's going to store some of these

146
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,340
in a product tree it's going to search

147
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,340
the product tree depth first

148
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,080
um and so while this does run quite a

149
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,560
bit faster it uses more memory

150
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,660
and so just a quick reminder on like a

151
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,360
product tree uh how it works is kind of

152
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,160
we start with the big n at the top that

153
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,039
we're trying to check what it is for

154
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,960
example if we go down the right hand of

155
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,520
the tree first we're going to compute n

156
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,340
over L3 L4 then when we want to compute

157
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,160
n over L4 we just multiply that by L3 we

158
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,539
check the things we need to check we

159
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,460
throw that away we go back up to end

160
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,699
over L3 L4 we multiply that by L4 to get

161
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,740
n over L3 check that throw it away and

162
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,880
then we can throw away that whole side

163
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,680
of the tree and continue down the other

164
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,199
side of the tree

165
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,460
so yeah as I mentioned it runs faster

166
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,220
but the memory is not great

167
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,360
um so next we're going to look at a

168
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,979
couple algorithms that we kind of put

169
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,199
forward in our paper

170
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,840
um the first of which uses semisogynies

171
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,419
so just as a quick reminder and isogeny

172
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,280
is a non-constant rational map between

173
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,900
two elliptic curves

174
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,340
this first algorithm we're going to look

175
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,919
at is concerned with what's called an L

176
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,419
isogeny graph

177
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,879
so here the script L is referring to the

178
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,560
degree of an isogony

179
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,780
we're not super concerned with the

180
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,460
technical definition of degree but we

181
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,860
can think of it sort of as a way to

182
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,900
think of a size of the isogeny we're

183
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,740
only going to be concerned with two

184
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,419
isogenies anyway and I'll touch more on

185
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,340
that later

186
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,020
but in general for an elisogyny graph

187
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,720
it's a graph where the vertex set is the

188
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,240
set of L isogenous curves so these are

189
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,680
just curves with L isogenies between

190
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,599
them optisomorphism

191
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,580
and the edge set is the set of L

192
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,580
isogenies between these curves

193
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,560
so in general for any elliptic curve

194
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,960
the LA sogeny the alliesogeny graph over

195
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,958
FP is going to be

196
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,299
this Forest of same-sized trees where

197
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,279
all the trees their roots are connected

198
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,260
by a cycle and so looking at the photo

199
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,700
you can kind of see why this was later

200
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,000
referred to as volcanoes

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,800
we're going to call the the Top Cycle

202
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,060
where the roots are connected the crater

203
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,160
of the volcano and the leaves are called

204
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,060
the floor

205
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,800
and so because all the the trees are

206
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,240
same size we also get this idea of

207
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,339
height of the volcano so you can kind of

208
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,220
see those like dashed ellipses these are

209
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,040
each like a level in the volcano and so

210
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,200
we can also put like maximum bounds on

211
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,620
Heights of different types of volcanoes

212
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,120
now where this gets interesting is when

213
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,040
we look at the curves as defined over FP

214
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,180
squared

215
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,180
supersingular curve isogony volcanoes

216
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,500
are actually going to lose the volcano

217
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,240
structure and they're going to be three

218
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,100
regular connected graphs

219
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,620
whereas ordinary curves so most curves

220
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,080
their isogony graph structure over FP

221
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,899
squared just becomes a bigger volcano so

222
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,200
it just continues down okay so

223
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,000
Sutherland's tests which was introduced

224
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,760
in 2011 aims to determine whether a

225
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,800
curve is super singular or Ordinary by

226
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,040
looking at its isogeny graph over FP

227
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,720
squared

228
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,880
if it determines that the graph is a

229
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,800
volcano then we conclude that the curve

230
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,779
is ordinary if it's not then it must be

231
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:49,980
super singular

232
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,680
and so how we're going to do this is

233
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,300
we're going to start by constructing

234
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,000
three non-pac backtracking paths in the

235
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,779
graph

236
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,519
uh and the reason we need these three

237
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,040
paths is because up to two of them might

238
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,019
get stuck in the crater at the top but

239
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,339
at least one of the paths is going to

240
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,620
end up descending down the volcano once

241
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,079
we start a descending path in a volcano

242
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,120
it will continue descending

243
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,220
so once we start these three pads we're

244
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,019
going to step through each path log two

245
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,700
P plus one times because this is the

246
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,940
maximum height of our of any isogeny

247
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,200
volcano

248
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,120
if we manage to step the maximum number

249
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,740
of times through each of these paths and

250
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,540
we don't hit the floor then that's

251
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,980
because we're not in a volcano at all

252
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,600
we're in a super singular graph so the

253
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,060
original curve was super singular

254
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,220
um if we do Hit the Floor then we're in

255
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,760
a volcano and the curve was ordinary

256
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,160
so how Sutherland implements this how we

257
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,959
actually take the steps in these paths

258
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,279
is using something called modular

259
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,140
polynomials

260
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,760
um so here I have the level two modular

261
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,320
polynomial you can see this is already

262
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,120
quite complicated so this is why we're

263
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,339
sticking to two isogenies only we get a

264
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:54,720
cubic instead

265
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,040
uh and the reason we're going to use

266
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,480
these polynomials is because they have a

267
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,700
really nice property that there will

268
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,740
exist a two-isogyny between two elliptic

269
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,459
curves if and only if the two modular

270
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,320
polynomial as defined at their J

271
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,079
invariance is equal to zero

272
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,360
so what we're going to do with this uh

273
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,579
is to begin our three non non-back

274
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:17,279
tracking paths we compute the modular

275
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,560
polynomial evaluated at the drain

276
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,779
variant of our starting curve over this

277
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:22,740
polynomial ring so we're going to

278
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,720
compute it over X this is going to give

279
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,399
us a cubic in x

280
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,200
once we Factor this we're going to get

281
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,339
the three roots and these are going to

282
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,260
be the three neighbors of our starting

283
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,480
curve in the graph

284
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,320
now at any step in any of the paths what

285
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,519
we're going to do is we're going to

286
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,700
evaluate our modular polynomial at the

287
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,339
curve J invariant that we're at

288
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,500
and we're going to divide by x minus the

289
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,660
Jain variant of where we just were

290
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,639
so this division makes sure we won't go

291
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,620
backwards in a path we will always be

292
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,540
going in a New Direction

293
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,639
and also this will make it a quadratic

294
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,760
so it's even that much easier to factor

295
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,800
if we hit a polynomial that is

296
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,000
irreducible

297
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,980
that means that we're in the like a leaf

298
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,600
and so we've hit the floor of the

299
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,519
volcano we can terminate instantly

300
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,740
because we know we're in a volcano

301
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,839
if we don't then we're going to do this

302
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:14,880
log two P plus one times in each of the

303
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,639
paths uh if we get it this far and we

304
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,500
don't hit an irreducible polynomial it's

305
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,880
because we're in the suprasingular graph

306
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,639
and so we note that it's super singular

307
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:26,160
so you can note even here

308
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,760
um

309
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,459
that in the seaside setting since we're

310
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,320
sort of expecting super singular curves

311
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,459
we're unfortunately going to have to do

312
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:33,899
the worst case of this algorithm every

313
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,639
time but in the case when you're getting

314
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,200
more ordinary curves this ends up

315
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,660
terminating way sooner than this worst

316
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,519
case uh and it works actually quite

317
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,360
quickly

318
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,639
uh this is also the only algorithm that

319
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,019
gives a definitive proof of super

320
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,540
singularity

321
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,279
so the first modification that was due

322
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,220
to Sutherland and the same paper

323
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,120
uh

324
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,980
for specifically the seaside case when

325
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,899
we only are concerned with curves over

326
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,720
FP is that assuming we are super

327
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,300
singular the FP portion of the volcano

328
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,160
is actually quite short it's these red

329
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,560
dots here it's just two levels so this

330
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,360
means within two steps we're going to

331
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,000
find a neighbor that's an FP squared

332
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,740
once we find a neighbor that's an FP

333
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,180
squared

334
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,940
um this will necessarily be a path that

335
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,500
is descending down and so we can

336
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,940
actually abandon the other two paths

337
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,500
because we're not we know we're not

338
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,000
going to get stuck in the crater

339
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,560
if we don't find a neighbor within two

340
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,240
steps it's because the FP portion is

341
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,740
bigger and so we're in an ordinary

342
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,100
volcano and so we could terminate anyway

343
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,660
so because we only have to follow One

344
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,339
path down basically within two steps

345
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:36,720
this ends up giving us a three-time

346
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,060
speed up

347
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,519
now the first modification we propose in

348
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,860
our paper was on the maximum length so

349
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,660
the maximum number of steps we're taking

350
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,420
in each path so as mentioned before for

351
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,800
the same reasoning we're going to find

352
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,959
the FP squared kind of drop off of the

353
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,300
volcano very soon so we don't need to

354
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,160
consider the entire length of the

355
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,540
volcano we only need to consider the

356
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,160
length of the FP squared portion of the

357
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,980
volcano and this is about half that and

358
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,180
so this together with the other

359
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,399
modification we end up with a about a

360
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,240
six times speed up

361
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,620
the second modification

362
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,060
there we go

363
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,680
um that we do is instead of using

364
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,360
modular polynomials to step through the

365
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,220
paths we end up just explicitly

366
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,040
Computing these two isogenies we do this

367
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,320
sort of change of coordinates so that

368
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,560
the X root uh in the next curve is where

369
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,600
we came from so we're only focused on

370
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,060
that quadratic and then to determine the

371
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,940
next curve we're really only concerned

372
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,620
with a particular discriminant so we

373
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,060
compute this to discriminant if it's

374
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,800
well defined that means the next curve

375
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,079
is well defined if it's not it means

376
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,560
we're at a leaf and so we terminate

377
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,180
cool so that was our modification for

378
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,760
Sutherland the second algorithm we

379
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,040
looked at is due to dallasconi and it

380
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,120
uses something called division

381
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,560
polynomials

382
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,660
so a division polynomial has this really

383
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,540
nice property that for the M division

384
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,940
polynomial a point evaluated in this

385
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,860
polynomial would be zero if and only if

386
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,440
that point was an M torsion point

387
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,079
uh and so one equivalent definition of

388
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,240
supersingularity is that a curve is

389
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,399
super super singular if there are no P

390
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,000
torsion points over any extension field

391
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,519
and so what Dallas County's test aims to

392
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,760
do is that it aims to compute the PS

393
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,860
division polynomial if we get that it's

394
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,779
a constant then we know that the curve

395
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,279
is super singular

396
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,720
if we get there's not a constant

397
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,820
obviously it's ordinary

398
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,360
and so how he does this so Dallas County

399
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,699
assess was introduced in 2018 so he uses

400
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,259
something called polynomial identity

401
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:38,940
testing to determine whether the

402
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,100
polynomial is

403
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,199
so we're going to take a random value of

404
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,139
FP squared we're going to compute or

405
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:48,839
evaluate the p is a division polynomial

406
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,899
at that point so this is somehow easier

407
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,399
to do than just Computing the actual

408
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,959
polynomial because there's kind of some

409
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,060
tricks behind it

410
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,560
um and so what happens is that if we get

411
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,899
that the polynomial evaluated at this

412
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,120
point is constant then one of two things

413
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,420
is happening either the polynomial

414
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,240
itself is just constant or we happen to

415
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,680
choose a point that was a root of the

416
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,959
polynomial now the odds that we chose a

417
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,500
root of the polynomial is 1 over 2p

418
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,180
um which is sufficiently small so if we

419
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,740
did end up getting a constant we can say

420
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,079
with probability one minus one over two

421
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,779
P that the curve is super singular

422
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,459
uh

423
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:29,100
so we only have one modification here

424
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,440
but it ends up working quite well

425
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,779
and so what we notice is that scalar

426
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,399
multiplication of points over elliptic

427
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,540
curves can be written in terms of

428
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,399
division polynomials

429
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,100
so in particular

430
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,180
projectively if you were to compute a

431
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,579
scalar multiplication of a point the Z

432
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,920
coordinate is going to be in terms of

433
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,079
explicitly the P the p is division

434
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,120
polynomial up to a projective Factor

435
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,320
Lambda

436
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,240
so what we do is we use this

437
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,620
differential addition

438
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,440
uh to compute the multiplication by P of

439
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,019
our random point we also explicitly

440
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,699
computed what the projective Factor

441
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:04,380
would be and so that way we can check

442
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,359
whether the P division polynomial at U

443
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,640
was constant or not

444
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,900
so

445
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,000
this when you kind of write out the

446
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,459
implementation for this it means up this

447
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,859
ends up being one single scalar

448
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,720
multiplication along with Computing

449
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,419
Lambda so the implementation is very

450
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,419
simple very easy to code

451
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:26,160
and actually when Ben sent me like the

452
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,199
the code in magma the comments were

453
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,660
longer than the code so it's it's very

454
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,640
nice for for implementation side of

455
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,559
things

456
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,940
and so now to compare all four

457
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,340
algorithms you can see

458
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,860
um in the far column where we're looking

459
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,080
at how it Compares over how they compute

460
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,640
ordinary curves

461
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,980
uh as I mentioned Sutherland performs

462
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,780
extremely well because it almost never

463
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,000
hits the worst case scenario

464
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,860
and it also had the nicest kind of

465
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,840
memory requirements but that middle

466
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,640
column which is the one we're concerned

467
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,140
about because in Seaside you're mostly

468
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,679
expecting super singular curves

469
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,299
performed the fastest and had reasonable

470
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,600
amount of memory so going forward we

471
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,700
recommend using dalaskani for use in

472
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,780
Seaside key validation

473
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,960
[Applause]

474
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,179
all right thank you so

475
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,020
um are there questions

476
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:28,919
all right let's double check if there

477
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,660
are any questions on Zoom is there any

478
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,380
questions on Zoom

479
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,480
foreign

480
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,889
[Music]

481
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,100
just going to ask if

482
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,960
your improvement for Dulles County's

483
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,700
meth bed works

484
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,160
over any any Prime field there's just

485
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,620
specifically over FP

486
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,320
um like Dallas County well I mean like

487
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,080
you you suggested an improvement to his

488
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,059
algorithm is that correct

489
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,500
I was just wondering if that Improvement

490
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,900
so an improvement design

491
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,700
in an improvement to dolaskani's

492
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,320
algorithm in the case that you're over

493
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,240
FP like does it use it the curve is

494
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,280
defined over FP or would it work

495
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,799
so over a extension field

496
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,960
um so Sutherland's algorithm works for

497
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,539
Curves over FP squared as well

498
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,500
dolaskani's algorithm would have to have

499
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,600
some kind of changes made to it to

500
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,120
different types of Curves and we touch

501
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,559
on that in the paper as well with a few

502
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:34,080
remarks but it's not trivial how we

503
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,780
could kind of extend it to other fields

504
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,640
oh okay so Dill it's not already the

505
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,380
original algorithm

506
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,419
yeah so as we implemented it it's only

507
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,700
for FP

508
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,440
it would be interesting work to see it

509
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,419
done for FP squared as well thanks

510
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:57,840
modify this other land algorithm why did

511
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,820
why do you cons only consider the

512
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,980
specific form of the color

513
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,240
iPad comma zero sorry the oh corner is

514
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,600
generated to Alpha comma zero but it's a

515
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,179
kind of specific

516
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:15,980
so why do you only consider this

517
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,120
I agree to misogyny that we know

518
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,980
it's kind of a short

519
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,600
computations just to see if the next

520
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,360
curve is going to exist or not

521
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,380
if there was kind of something that

522
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,120
worked faster another explicit to

523
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,440
isogenic definition you could do that

524
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,580
but um

525
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,260
yeah that's kind of why we chose that

526
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,280
one

527
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,440
thank you

528
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,760
any other questions

529
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,500
okay let's thank our speaker again for

530
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,900
the next talk

531
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,020
thank you
