1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
okay so um showhead are you all set up

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,120
it looks like you're screen sharing

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,520
already i'm ready

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,000
okay great

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,120
okay our next speaker is shahid sharif

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,639
he's going to talk to us about quantum

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,240
money from quaternion algebras

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,800
thanks travis um

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,039
thanks to the organizers for uh putting

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,199
on uh this conference

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,080
um so uh all about what i'm going to be

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,160
talking about is joint work with daniel

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,719
kane and al silverberg

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,040
and is based on some earlier work of

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,840
daniel kane from a few years ago

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,960
um

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,399
so first of all let me talk about what

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,360
quantum money is uh because of

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,120
cryptocurrency because it sort of sucks

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,600
a lot of the oxygen out of the room um a

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,079
lot of people immediately what springs

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,760
to mind is the kind of functionality

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,840
that cryptocurrency provides but quantum

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,440
money is a totally

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,440
separate object

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,640
it's a money i mean um just concretely

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,920
it's money which consists of both

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,119
quantum and classical data uh but really

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,280
you want to think of it as a drop-in

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,760
replacement for paper money

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,560
not as some kind of um uh

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,240
digital money that has some sort of

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,479
privacy guarantees

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,479
um the main

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,799
you use the main motivation behind it is

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,720
an observation by wiesner in 1983 uh and

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,479
uh travis from the previous talk

38
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,720
mentioned the no cloning theorem uh we

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,799
observed that you could use this no

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,680
cloning theorem to come up with uh money

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,439
that potentially would be very difficult

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,200
to counterfeit so that's really the

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
motivation behind quantum money so let

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,360
me be a bit more precise

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,920
quantum money protocol consists of three

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,880
things

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,479
the first is a specification for what

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,399
the money actually looks like

49
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,119
and i already said it consists of both

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,520
some quantum data and some classical

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,280
data so i like to think of this

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,840
physically as being something like a a

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,159
credit card with two little chips in it

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,159
and one of them's a regular

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,600
chip that contains some classical data

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,040
and the other one is a quantum chip i

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
don't know what that'll look like in the

58
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,720
future but something that contains the

59
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,878
quantum data

60
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,760
then we have a minting algorithm

61
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,200
which allows you to produce bills but

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,239
you only want the authority

63
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,120
who

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,840
normally produces uh fiat money so let's

65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
say the treasury department in our case

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,520
to have access to this algorithm so it's

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,040
a private algorithm that will produce

68
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,560
valid quantum bills

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,239
but we would also like the general

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,560
public to be able to verify that in fact

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,760
a given quantum bank note is in fact

72
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,239
valid so we have a verify algorithm

73
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,480
which allows you to uh that allows the

74
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,879
general public to authenticate whether a

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,959
quantum bill is valid or not

76
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,200
okay so that's what a quantum money

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,760
protocol is the security that we want is

78
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,319
this anti-counterfeiting security that

79
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,319
if an adversary has

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,319
access to a bunch of bills

81
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,000
valid bills that they cannot produce

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
additional valid bills

83
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,319
so we'll say a a quantum money protocol

84
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,200
secures if this is not possible

85
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,599
um so just a little overview of existing

86
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,360
proposals

87
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,319
uh

88
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,519
so the first um public

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,360
so i guess what i should say is this is

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,879
what i'm describing is really public key

91
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,120
quantum money um

92
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
uh there are other quantum money

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,799
proposals uh

94
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,720
but uh in terms of public key quantum

95
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,879
money the first one was pros by ahrens

96
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,159
in 2009 followed up by uh harrison

97
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,200
cristiano in 2012.

98
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,680
both of those were broken um also in

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,560
2012 fari gosset hasidim little mirsky

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
and shore proposed a quantum money

101
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,040
protocol that is based on not theory um

102
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,159
there are there are some issues that

103
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,840
they don't have a security proof but

104
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,239
that one is so far unbroken so be

105
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,400
interesting um if anyone knows not

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,799
theory to see uh how that pans out um

107
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,439
in 2019 january proposed um in his

108
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,120
quantum lightning paper another proposal

109
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,159
and that was broken uh a year afterwards

110
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,439
i believe uh in that same paper um

111
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,239
jandry proposed a fix to the aronson

112
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,280
christiano scheme in 2012 that fix

113
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,358
required uh indistinguishability

114
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,159
obfuscation

115
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,000
okay so uh uh travis gave a nice

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
overview of quantum computing i'm gonna

117
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,160
do the same thing uh so there'll be a

118
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,680
bit of overlap with his uh approach so

119
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,840
um i'm gonna let little m be the number

120
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,759
of qubits so if you're familiar with

121
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,440
classical computing you know what bits

122
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,240
are uh so these this is a quantum analog

123
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,759
we don't want too many of them or the

124
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,840
computation becomes too big

125
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,880
um

126
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,639
capital m will be roughly two to the

127
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,520
little m and i'm going to let v be the

128
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,000
capital m dimensional uh complex vector

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,479
space um with the usual

130
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,800
permission inner product

131
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
then i'll write using the physics

132
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,720
notation this cat notation i'll write

133
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,360
ketro to denote a unit vector in our

134
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,520
vector space and i'll call that a

135
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,440
quantum state

136
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,680
so whenever you see this uh ket notation

137
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,120
this vertical line and this angle

138
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,520
bracket that will always mean a unit

139
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,360
vector and always denotes a quantum

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,759
mistake

141
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,840
if i put an integer between 0 and

142
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
dimension

143
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,400
-1

144
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,960
inside this ket that means it's that

145
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,720
corresponding standard basis vector

146
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,759
i'll let capital u be an m by m unitary

147
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,400
and capital u will always denote that

148
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,479
then when we have this a quantum

149
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,000
computation is just the computation of

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,280
um a product of this form you apply u to

151
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,160
um

152
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,639
the the first standard basis vector the

153
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,520
zeroth standard basis vector okay

154
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,240
okay so uh one major difference between

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,319
quantum computation and classical

156
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,919
computation is that if you have a

157
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,840
quantum state this this is essentially

158
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,319
your quantum version of data um you

159
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,080
can't actually look inside it so it's a

160
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,160
vector but you can't actually examine

161
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,319
the entries

162
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,080
and say oh what's the third coordinate

163
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,759
what's the fifth coordinate

164
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,840
instead we have this thing called phase

165
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
estimation

166
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,199
and the input of this phase estimation

167
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,000
procedure is a unitary matrix and a

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,319
quantum state and the output is going to

169
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,680
be a random eigenvector eigenvalue pair

170
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,000
uh where i'm talking about eigenvectors

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,919
eigenvalues for

172
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,880
the unitary operator u um the way it

173
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,120
works is follows um you pick an

174
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,800
orthonormal eigen basis for you

175
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,120
you write your quantum state in terms of

176
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,000
that eigen basis with coefficients as i

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,160
have written here alpha i

178
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,120
and then

179
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,280
we're going to pick one of these uh

180
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,840
eigenvase elements randomly and the

181
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,319
probability that's chosen is exactly

182
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,639
equal to the norm squared of that

183
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,520
corresponding coefficient so because rho

184
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,840
is a unit vector and this is a an

185
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,639
orthonormal uh list of vectors the the

186
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,000
psi eyes

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
the the sum of the squares of the alpha

188
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,520
eyes is going to be one so this this is

189
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
consistent with uh the way probability

190
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,039
is supposed to work

191
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,680
and then we replace our input quantum

192
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,319
state rho with the psi i so our original

193
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,240
quantum state sort of gets destroyed it

194
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,800
gets replaced so we can't really

195
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,560
extract additional information from the

196
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,960
same quantum state

197
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,400
on the other hand

198
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,800
uh the fact that we replace rho means

199
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,639
that the phase estimation procedure is

200
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,960
item point if you do apply it twice

201
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,319
you're just going to get the same thing

202
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,840
the second time as the first time

203
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,680
because if you start uh our equivalent

204
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,160
because if you start with an eigenvector

205
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,520
you're going to end up with the same

206
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,360
eigenvector here i've suppressed the

207
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,199
eigenvalue but the eigenvalue is also

208
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,240
part of the output

209
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,160
okay and then travis also mentioned the

210
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,319
no cloning theorem here it is it's very

211
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,319
innocuous so from a mathematical

212
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,919
perspective there's there's nothing to

213
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,319
it from a physics perspective this

214
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,080
really tells you that you can't copy

215
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,800
data so if row is the quantum data that

216
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,560
you'd like to copy

217
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,879
oops

218
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,720
if row is the quantum data that you'd

219
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,400
like to copy

220
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,560
you think of the on the left hand side

221
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,120
the zero as being a blank slate and on

222
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,479
the right hand side you've copied it

223
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,800
over into that blank register so now you

224
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,560
have two copies so this is not really

225
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,960
allowed

226
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,120
okay so um

227
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,720
uh and so that's the whole idea behind

228
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,479
the quantum money if you have if that's

229
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,479
your quantum data then you can't make a

230
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,240
second copy of it and that's supposed to

231
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,559
be the uh the idea behind oh well this

232
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,200
is going to be hard to counterfeit so uh

233
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
our proposal

234
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,279
for quantum money uh let me give the

235
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,560
generic version first so uh as part of

236
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,160
the setup if we first choose um t

237
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,640
commuting unitaries that possess a real

238
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,399
eigen basis u1 through ut

239
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,600
and quantum bills consist of

240
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,640
triples of this form so psi tensor psi

241
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,760
lambda and sigma where psi is a joint

242
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,920
eigenstate of the ui so because these

243
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,880
are commuting uh matrices there is a

244
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,720
joint eigen basis

245
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,120
so we take uh pick an eigenvector and

246
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
take tensor product with itself that'll

247
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,440
be the quantum part of the bill and the

248
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,920
classical part of the bill are these

249
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,000
the lambda and the sigma the lambda is

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,720
just the vector of eigenvalues so lambda

251
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,120
1 would be the eigenvalue of psi with

252
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,519
respect to u1 and so forth and then

253
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,240
sigma is just a digital signature

254
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,640
for that uh for that vector of

255
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,959
eigenvalues

256
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,880
okay so that's the specification for

257
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,839
what the quantum bank notes look like

258
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,279
um the minting algorithm is as follows

259
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,920
we first construct this quantum state

260
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,519
which is the sum over all the j's of j

261
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,760
tensor j so remember this is this is the

262
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,000
notation for the j standard uh basis

263
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,360
vector

264
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,760
and then we apply the phase estimation

265
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,399
method to this row

266
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,920
with u1

267
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,480
tensor i and then you repeat this with

268
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,640
the remaining use

269
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
and the reason that this works

270
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,480
is because

271
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,519
the sum of j tensor j equals the sum of

272
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,600
psi j tensor psi j whereas the psi j are

273
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,560
a real orthonormal eigen basis joint

274
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,120
eigen basis for the use

275
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,040
so when you apply this phase estimation

276
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,760
procedure you'll get one of the summands

277
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,000
on the right hand side and the one that

278
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,480
you get will be chosen with uniform

279
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,000
probability so they're all equally

280
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
likely

281
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,040
so that gives you

282
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,120
the psi tensor psi the first part of the

283
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,800
quantum bill and then the phase

284
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,720
estimation also gives you the eigenvalue

285
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
so that gives you the vector lambda so

286
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,640
now you just digitally sign that tuple

287
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
and that gives you the sigma uh of

288
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,040
course the digital signature algorithm

289
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,120
that requires access to the signing key

290
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,880
which is a private key and that's what

291
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,640
makes this minting algorithm a private

292
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,199
algorithm

293
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,040
okay that leaves the verification so

294
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
this is supposed to be a public

295
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,160
algorithm so we have our uh our

296
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,839
unitaries and then we have a quantum

297
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,360
bill how do you check that it's actually

298
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,519
valid so you just apply the phase

299
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,920
estimation procedure again if rho is in

300
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,519
fact of the form psi tensor psi j tends

301
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,000
or psi j uh or a psi case that tends for

302
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,240
psi k let's say then that's gonna be an

303
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,680
eigenvector of u j tensor i and also of

304
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,240
i tense or uj for all j and so the phase

305
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,320
estimation procedure will

306
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,720
preserve that constant state but it'll

307
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,640
also the phase estimation procedure will

308
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,040
also give you the eigenvalues so you can

309
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,839
actually check that the lambda is

310
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,959
correct and then you just check that the

311
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,760
digital signature is correct as well

312
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,279
uh and anyone can do this so this is a

313
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,079
public algorithm

314
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,519
okay so uh for a security so i mentioned

315
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,560
that we want to make sure that

316
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,720
counterfeiting is not possible we reduce

317
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,480
to the following security problem which

318
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,040
is a triple triplicate eigenstate

319
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,079
problem given the commuting unitaries

320
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,200
can you produce a triple eigen triple

321
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,440
tensor product of an eigenstate with

322
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,800
itself so in the minting procedure

323
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,680
we actually produce a double tensor but

324
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,600
somehow producing a triple tensor is

325
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,279
much harder than producing a double

326
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,320
tensor

327
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,360
and that's really what the security

328
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,680
boils down to um so we show that the

329
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
security depends on this problem and

330
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,079
then we prove that if an adversary has

331
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,880
only black box access to the unitary

332
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
matrices uh to the unitary operators

333
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,200
then there's no efficient algorithm that

334
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,880
can solve the security problem and

335
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,120
therefore putting it all together uh the

336
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,040
black box protocol for this quantum

337
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,600
money is unconditionally secure

338
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,519
so i'll put the this is the formal

339
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,720
statement of our theorem so the we you

340
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,399
have a quantum circuit

341
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,120
that has decontrolled you j gate so here

342
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,880
i'm thinking of uj as being black boxes

343
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,720
so in a classical algorithm you could

344
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
say that we're making d

345
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,440
calls to ujs as oracles

346
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,399
um

347
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,440
and then the u's are going to vary uh

348
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,600
randomly in some way

349
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,120
and so we'd like to see what is the

350
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,279
probability that our quantum circuit can

351
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,839
solve the security problem and we give

352
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,320
this uh

353
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
expression for the probability in terms

354
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,839
of the number of queries to the uj um if

355
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,959
d is if the number of queries d is

356
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,480
polynomial

357
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,560
in uh log n

358
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,160
then this probability will be a

359
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,760
negligible probability which gives us

360
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,880
the security that we want

361
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,279
okay so that was the generic

362
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,480
protocol but we have to have an actual

363
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,040
instantiation so what we use for our

364
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,760
instantiation just briefly is just we

365
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,600
take brand matrices and take

366
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,079
exponentials of the brand matrices so

367
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,040
now let me explain what that is uh so

368
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,320
this is not the long version the long

369
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,720
reading is too long for talk

370
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,959
but the longer version is we choose

371
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,560
capital n to be a large prime

372
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,880
we take b to be the quaternion algebra

373
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,880
ramified at capital n and infinity

374
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
so for instance if capital n is

375
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,720
congruent to three mod four then this

376
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,399
quaternion algebra looks like this so

377
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,399
it's uh as a vector space it's four

378
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,199
dimensional over q generated by one i j

379
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,600
and k and we have these um

380
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,199
multiplicative relations i squared is

381
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,360
negative n j squared equals negative one

382
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,279
i j is equal to k

383
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,160
and

384
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,519
j i is equal to negative ij

385
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,639
then you pick a maximal order in b so

386
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,800
this is a ring

387
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,040
a sub ring of b which is maximal for the

388
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,680
property that it is um

389
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,399
uh finite as a z module so it'll be rank

390
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,160
four

391
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,120
and then

392
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,399
cls of o is the left class set of o so

393
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,160
it's not uh so this is like the class

394
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,639
group but it's it's because we have this

395
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,079
we're in a quatrainian algebra it's not

396
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,560
going to be a group it'll just be a set

397
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,079
so it's just going to be the set of left

398
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,279
ideals

399
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,880
uh of o

400
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,079
under

401
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,519
essentially the equivalence that you

402
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,040
would think it would be for class groups

403
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,720
except we only allow multiplication on

404
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,000
the right

405
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,800
to give equivalence

406
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,680
v is going to be the vector space whose

407
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,560
basis elements are exactly the ideal

408
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,839
classes in the class set

409
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,639
and then we're going to pick a set of t

410
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,040
small primes p1 through pt

411
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,880
and then we have this thing called a

412
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,839
brand operator uh so on

413
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,880
uh so for each prime of small prime p

414
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,360
that we've chosen the associated brand

415
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,800
operator takes an ideal class

416
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,920
to a formal sum of uh other ideal

417
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,959
classes and it's essentially ideal

418
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,800
classes so that

419
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,120
there are representatives which have

420
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,160
index

421
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,959
p

422
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,040
inside the starting ideal class

423
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,959
so these brand operators they're

424
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,680
self-adjoint for an appropriate uh inner

425
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,160
product um

426
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,000
so when you take a self-adjoint matrix

427
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,160
and take a complex exponential so e to

428
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,600
the i t j

429
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,680
that gives you a unitary matrix and so

430
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,199
those are going to be our unitary matrix

431
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,240
matrices the brand operators are commute

432
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,920
with each other and therefore the

433
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,440
unitaries are also going to commute with

434
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,360
each other

435
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,600
okay so i didn't really give that

436
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,959
detailed an explanation of the brand

437
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,279
matrices so let me give a couple

438
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,880
alternate characterizations that you may

439
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,440
be more familiar with uh the first one

440
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,920
the most more number theoretic one is

441
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,480
the uh the t of p

442
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,000
um so for the small prime little p uh

443
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,720
the

444
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,880
th is the the heck operator acting on

445
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,360
weight two cusp forms of level n so in

446
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,440
other words the vector space v

447
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,399
is isomorphic to the space of weight two

448
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,880
cusp forms of level n and then the brand

449
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,959
operator acts like the corresponding

450
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,720
heka operator

451
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,400
and then the second characterization

452
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,079
which probably is familiar to most of

453
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,640
you is if you take the set of super

454
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,520
singular j invariants in characteristic

455
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,640
capital n

456
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,359
and look at the p isogeny graph

457
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,959
then t of p is just the adjacency matrix

458
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,359
for the for that p isogenic ground so in

459
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,799
a sense this is actually the better

460
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,039
characterization because up to

461
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,600
reordering of your basis elements

462
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,919
this will literally give you the same

463
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,280
matrix

464
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,600
so in the heck operator case you have to

465
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,080
pick a basis first and it's unclear what

466
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,600
basis to pick

467
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,520
to get the right

468
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,720
matrix that we use

469
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,919
okay so now let me talk a little bit

470
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,760
about some open problems related to the

471
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,919
security of the scheme

472
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,280
so the first one has to do with

473
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,480
randomness

474
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,160
um so we would essentially just like uh

475
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,520
that our operators the the ujs

476
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,000
that they um

477
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,960
that they're both the eigenvalues and

478
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,880
the eigenvectors

479
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,360
act somehow randomly

480
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,120
so we do have some information about the

481
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,400
eigenvalues

482
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,000
ser in 97 i believed

483
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,320
showed that the eigenvalues

484
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,039
of the these normalized brand uh

485
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,080
operators are distributed according

486
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,120
to

487
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,559
this measure

488
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,720
so they in the limit as capital n goes

489
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,039
to infinity if you fix little p um the

490
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,200
eigenvalues approach this limit uh and

491
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,400
in fact he showed more than that he

492
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,640
showed that if you give as as we do in

493
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,600
our setup have t primes p1 through pt

494
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,360
and look at the joint distribution of

495
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,280
the eigenvalues that they are

496
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,320
independent and approach

497
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,080
the product distribution

498
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,880
but unfortunately that's not enough

499
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,799
we really would like those eigenvalues

500
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,880
to to really act randomly and so uh the

501
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,240
question that we'd like to know the

502
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,720
answer to is um are the eigenvalues

503
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,640
actually indistinguishable i don't

504
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,160
distinguishable here but same question

505
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,480
really are they distinguishable from

506
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,960
random from a computational standpoint

507
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,120
so you can think that think of this uh

508
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,679
in the following uh more formal sense if

509
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,320
you let capital n be really large uh and

510
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,400
you pick up prime small prime p

511
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,240
and then i take just a few of the

512
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,440
eigenvalues of t of p

513
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,880
so polynomial in the log of n

514
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
and then i also give you some random

515
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,120
numbers that follow the same

516
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,520
distribution that sares theorem

517
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,320
describes can you tell them apart

518
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,400
and hopefully the answer is no but i

519
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,840
have no idea

520
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,360
uh as for the eigen basis the eigen

521
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,200
basis is even um harder i don't think

522
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,280
there's any results known about this but

523
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,880
if the eigen basis for instance is very

524
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
predictable then it's very easy to

525
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,320
counterfeit money because maybe you can

526
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,240
predict oh i know that this particular

527
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,880
vector is going to be an eigenvector or

528
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,640
is very likely to be an eigenvector and

529
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,320
then maybe you can just

530
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,159
manufacture it directly and then

531
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,000
manufacture three copies and that gives

532
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,080
you a solution to the security problem

533
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,559
um so here i i mean in the

534
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,000
representation that we use with

535
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
quaternion algebras so you could instead

536
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,159
use the super singular elliptic curve

537
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,919
representation that's that's harder to

538
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,919
compete with but it at least amounts to

539
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,280
the same question so in that

540
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,480
representation um is that is there some

541
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,400
pattern to the way the eigenvectors look

542
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,080
or is it really just you can't tell it

543
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,720
from a random or orthogonal uh basis

544
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,000
uh there's another attack um so in the

545
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
quantum realm this is called quantum

546
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,480
state restoration uh if you can write

547
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,120
one of these mystery eigenvectors

548
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,640
um as a tensor product

549
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,320
of two uh

550
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
other vectors

551
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,559
then you can uh

552
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,559
do you can do like a dimension reduction

553
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,880
attack and try to

554
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,159
copy v and w individually um but of

555
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,440
course in order for this to work you

556
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
have to be able to write your joint

557
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,559
eigenvector

558
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,720
in this form so here our given

559
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,360
eigenvector is psi and we'd like to be

560
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,679
able to write it in the form v tensor w

561
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,320
so this may not be possible and even if

562
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,400
it is can you come up with it so the

563
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,919
question is for our particular

564
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,799
instantiation um is there an efficiently

565
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,640
computable way to come up with such a

566
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,840
decomposition um even part of the time

567
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,760
uh there's some other open problems in

568
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,840
the paper which i invite you to check

569
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,559
out

570
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,740
but otherwise thank you so much

571
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:46,320
[Applause]

572
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,600
all right are there any questions for

573
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,080
the speaker

574
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,120
kate has a question

575
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,880
um you have a slide a couple slides back

576
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,400
oh we lost you put it back up

577
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,440
okay

578
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,600
um yeah a couple slides back you

579
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,120
mentioned the distribution of ser

580
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
yes and you had a couple questions after

581
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,880
that one and two there and i'm just

582
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,120
wondering if um if anybody's done

583
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,000
numerical experiments if there's data or

584
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,039
evidence for these

585
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,039
uh

586
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,880
yeah that's a great question so um there

587
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,799
have been additional

588
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,080
results

589
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,760
um let's see there's uh murty and sinha

590
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,679
have some additional results

591
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,039
and um i i just talked to somebody uh

592
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,720
zuberlina and sarnak i think have some

593
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,679
additional results um

594
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,400
but they're all asymptotics in terms of

595
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,520
like um how close how good is sare's

596
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,120
estimate um so i have no idea what the

597
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,960
data would look like that would tell you

598
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,440
whether it's distinguishable from random

599
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,919
um so yeah so people have generated data

600
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,080
but just looking at the data

601
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,960
um

602
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,480
i don't even know what you would look

603
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,159
for to tell so uh yeah so i i guess i

604
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,240
would answer i don't really know so

605
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,120
yes but in regards to this question i

606
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,520
don't know

607
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,760
there's another question

608
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,440
yeah i had another i had a question

609
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,880
about this slide as well

610
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,039
uh so forgive me if i'm missing

611
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,240
something but

612
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,720
is the question whether the uh

613
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,200
eigenvalues are distinguishable from

614
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,760
like randomly sampling from the

615
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,919
distribution that uh

616
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,000
like independently randomly sampling

617
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,320
from sarah's distribution or or the

618
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,919
question whether sarah's distribution is

619
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,559
like distinguishable from something else

620
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,480
no no it's the first one

621
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,440
okay so so the like the eigenvalues may

622
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,520
not actually be independent

623
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,320
and and like how to what degree is that

624
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,200
uh

625
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,279
detectable

626
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,640
yeah i mean so uh

627
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,520
it's it's not it's even stronger uh i

628
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,240
mean

629
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,000
there can be even worse behavior than

630
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,640
not being independent

631
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,880
well i guess uh i guess it depends

632
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,400
by independent but yeah yeah there could

633
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,000
be certain patterns in the way that the

634
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,799
eigenvalues occur um so they could be

635
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,919
like very evenly spaced for instance

636
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,600
right

637
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,960
and they would still follow a

638
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,720
distribution

639
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,640
uh but then you'd be able to detect them

640
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,720
you'd say oh well they repel each other

641
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,919
so therefore i know that the this random

642
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,360
one where there's some more clustering

643
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,679
is the actual random one and not the the

644
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,279
sare distribution

645
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,480
or i'm sorry

646
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,400
the distribution eigen values

647
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,799
okay yeah it's kind of weird

648
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,120
i mean i i to be honest i don't really

649
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,120
understand randomness

650
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,640
and this these like questions of like

651
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,400
what what is random how random is

652
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,520
something so um this also really puzzled

653
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,960
me when when i came across this um idea

654
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,200
that yeah we know the stair result but

655
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,039
that doesn't actually guarantee

656
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,520
randomness in the computational sense so

657
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,279
it's possible that

658
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,480
i mean if you think of like the digits

659
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,120
of pi you can uh easily compute them

660
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,600
right you can't really predict them

661
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,960
so the question is can you predict

662
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,919
something

663
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,120
um

664
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,050
about the eigenvalues

665
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,760
[Music]

666
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,200
and if you can do that kind of

667
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,480
prediction so this is sort of like an

668
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,039
information theoretic question um then

669
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,880
that could possibly enable an attack

670
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,600
oh wait thank you

671
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,520
any more questions

672
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,960
yeah one in the back you'd like to

673
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,159
um earlier on in your talk you gave a

674
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,799
result on your generic version about

675
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,440
like unconditional security

676
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,840
and i was wondering if you needed this

677
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,640
randomness in your concrete

678
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,919
instantiation to be able to apply this

679
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,760
result or if you needed it for sort of

680
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,240
to mitigate other possible attacks or i

681
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,640
was just wondering why

682
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
like why can't you reply

683
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,200
this result on your instantiation that

684
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,960
you have

685
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,279
ah

686
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,240
yeah uh

687
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,240
why can't we

688
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,919
apply this result um

689
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,440
because

690
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,200
yeah i mean i guess i would say

691
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,720
essentially because we don't know that

692
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,919
they're

693
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,440
random

694
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,840
so this result the theorem

695
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,679
um

696
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,159
yeah so the theorem let me say a little

697
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,880
bit about the randomness in this theorem

698
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,720
so i wrote this as a suitably random

699
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,080
tuple of commuting

700
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,640
unitaries um so

701
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,960
the way we generate these unitaries is

702
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,320
we choose

703
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,039
a a real eigen basis

704
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,679
um completely randomly so that uniformly

705
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,279
at random and then we choose um the

706
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,679
corresponding

707
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:09,760
eigenvalues and that one you basically

708
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,120
can choose any distribution as long as

709
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,919
uh choosing the same eigenvalue has

710
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,840
probability twice has probability of

711
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,520
zero so for instance

712
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,360
you could use series distribution

713
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,039
or you could use some sort of uniform

714
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,039
distribution um

715
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:25,840
so

716
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,720
uh

717
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,240
because we don't

718
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,200
know

719
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,080
that

720
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,679
right because the brand operators

721
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,240
they're they are deterministic you can't

722
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,960
actually compute them so

723
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,279
that's essentially part of the question

724
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,000
um do they act randomly enough that they

725
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,640
fall under the rubric of this theorem

726
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,720
and i guess i'll tell you in terms of

727
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
the eigenvalues i think probably the

728
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,399
answer is yes

729
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,320
i don't have a ton of intuition about it

730
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,480
for the eigenvectors i think that's the

731
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,080
really the

732
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,720
problem uh because the brand matrices

733
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,679
are sparse so i think you pick a random

734
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,279
eigen basis you're not going to get um

735
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,919
the exponentials to be sparse that

736
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,480
should happen with zero probability

737
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,880
so i so i mean in terms of like the

738
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,559
actual uh

739
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,120
rigorous formal proof this theorem just

740
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,720
doesn't apply because the brand

741
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,640
operators aren't literally random in

742
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,399
terms of like why

743
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,480
i mean i i hope that this theorem also

744
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,840
applies to the brand operators in

745
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,080
principle but because we don't have

746
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,279
these randomness results for the

747
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,760
eigenvalues and eigen basis we can't

748
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,200
literally apply the theorem does that

749
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,399
answer your question

750
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,520
yeah it does thank you okay

751
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,880
any further questions

752
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,840
okay maybe i'll end with the with a

753
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,279
lighter one do i need to worry about

754
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,240
like a

755
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,720
quantum rfid scanner wiping out all my

756
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,660
quantum money or

757
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,440
[Laughter]

758
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,399
uh yes you do if we do quantum money i

759
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,960
mean i don't know yeah so

760
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,159
the you could uh you could delete the

761
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,720
the classical part

762
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,840
because

763
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,159
you need the digital signature given by

764
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,320
the treasury department to guarantee

765
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,559
that the um

766
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,320
the bill is

767
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,678
uh let me see where is it

768
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,399
yeah here it is yeah so you need the

769
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,679
digital signature so if someone wipes

770
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,840
out the digital part of the data you're

771
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,760
already in trouble here but you know

772
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,360
with paper money someone can already rip

773
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,039
up a bill

774
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,799
so it's not as if we don't have that

775
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,520
problem nowadays

776
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,279
well thank you thank you for the for the

777
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,960
great talk uh let's thank our speaker

778
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,000
one more time

779
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,400
[Applause]
