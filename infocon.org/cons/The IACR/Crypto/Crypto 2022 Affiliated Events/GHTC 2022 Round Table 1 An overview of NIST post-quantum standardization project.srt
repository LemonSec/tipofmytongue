1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,399
here uh to our audience and to our

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,799
distinguished panelists uh this is the

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,520
very first edition of the glowing topics

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,080
in cryptography uh with the topic of

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,960
cryptographic agility so we will start

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,039
with some opening remarks and now please

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,320
dr najwa rash can you please

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,720
start

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,920
hi everyone attending physically and

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,160
virtually it's good to see lots of

cryptography ghtc in a prestigious venue

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,800
such as crypto 2022 and i take the

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,879
opportunity to thank

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,800

committee

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,600
as you know gstc is being organized by

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,160
the technology innovation institute

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,399
which is a large research institute

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,320
based out of abu dhabi

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,600
today we have uh 10 research centers

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,680
and one of those research centers is the

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,600
cryptography research center which i'm

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,479
currently heading uh you see a few of my

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,159
colleagues in the audience and

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,640
additionally we have three papers and in

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,159
crypto 2022 by jean-paul andre and

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,200
javier and we're also happy that our ceo

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,680
dr ray johnson could make it to the uh

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,960
audience today

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,680
so about gsd ghdc the program committee

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,159
and myself wanted to gather some of the

35
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,680
most prominent and renowned

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,840
cryptographers and crypto practitioners

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,320
today who i would like to thank very

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,280
much

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,439
um thank you all for attending

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,520
physically and and virtually it's our

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,600
privilege to have you here

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,920
so we will be talking about some of the

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,840
hottest topics and cryptography

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,920
including the post-quantum crypto

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,399
standardization efforts which resulted

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,960
with the first standards in july 2022

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,479
with more to come

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,439
we will also address crypto agility as

49
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,520
we apply moscow's theorem protect

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,200
against the threat of harness now

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,920
decrypt later and start migrating our

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,640
crypto assets to hybrid and post quantum

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,080
[Music]

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,239
alternatives um

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,720
also the third the third panel or the

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,200
third table we'll be talking about the

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
lightweight competition some of the

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,280
lightweight primitives and addressing

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,239
also the importance of crypto agility

60
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,720
and the adoption of those

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,959
lightweight primitives once more and

62
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,879
without taking too much time of the

63
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,800
first panel i would like to thank our

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,720
distinguished panelists the program

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,000
committee

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,440
paolo laila francisco and mike and

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,040
thanks to the audience and i hope you

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,800
will enjoy the day and find it very

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,680
informative thank you

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,239
thank you very much uh dr nashwa so we

71
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,480
will continue now with uh dr paulo

72
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,239
barreto professor paolo barreto who is

73
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,640
going to have some opening remarks about

74
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,040
this workshop please paulo

75
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,760
thank you francisco and thank you all

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,519
who are in attendance

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,920
physically or or virtually

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,959
um so this is the very first instance of

79
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,440
this new series of workshops

80
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,959
um i think it's quite timely like if

81
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,440
like any anybody who's uh following

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,879
discussions in the social networks is

83
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,480
aware that there is a a a lot of things

84
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,599
going on a lot of parallel discussions

85
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,840
about um the

86
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,920
standardization of post-quantum

87
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,200
cryptography

88
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,000
so

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,040
um

90
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,040
uh the whole series will focus on what

91
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,920
is

92
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,720
uh

93
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,120
causing the same kind of stir along

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
three years so for this year of course

95
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,640
it's post quantum next year i don't know

96
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,280
um what will

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,720
will happen next year and then the next

98
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,760
one and then the next one but the the

99
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,159
idea is the same let's bring people to

100
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,599
provide their views on these subjects

101
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,840
that are being actively

102
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,680
uh discussed

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,200
everywhere

104
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,480
um

105
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,200
so

106
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,400
uh

107
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,439
i would like to to to to thank the

108
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,680
panelists here that there is one that

109
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
will be uh

110
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,798
remote

111
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,720
look at the fail so i'll give him a

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,560
chance to to to talk to um of course

113
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,560
um but let's then start and talk about

114
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,960
um our panelists for this session our

115
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,320
session this one

116
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,680
uh will be focused on the nist

117
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,560
post-quantum standard decision process

118
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
so it's

119
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,360
it's present it's past and its future

120
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,160
and so um i'll give a chance now to to

121
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
to our panelists to introduce themselves

122
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,759
i mean i could provide

123
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,240
statistics and trivia about each one of

124
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,639
them but i think it's important to give

125
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,040
them the opportunity to to talk about

126
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,600
themselves like yeah i i have a lot of

127
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,880
papers there and there but i'm just the

128
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,759
the next guy here or

129
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,720
or not

130
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,800
so first one is

131
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
dustin moody um

132
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,600
would you like to talk about

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,080
yourself thank you i'm glad to be here

134
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,360
at this uh this panel here so i'm dustin

135
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,919
moody i've been at nist for

136
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,479
about 10 years or so

137
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,280
um

138
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,479
around 2014 or 15 we started kicking up

139
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,960
our post quantum cryptography

140
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,280
project and building our team and

141
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,560
and so on and

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,560
for some reason they asked me to to lead

143
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,000
that project and i didn't even really

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,560
know what post quantum was at the time

145
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,199
and here it is several years later and i

146
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,080
now know a bit more about what it is so

147
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,560
um my background's in elliptic curves

148
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,320
that's kind of what i studied when i was

149
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,960
getting my phd and i've been trying to

150
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
learn as much as as possible about

151
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,039
lattices and codes and everything else

152
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,240
but

153
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,759
happy to to see everyone here

154
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,120
thank you justin so

155
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,560
next online is peter schwab

156
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,400
good morning everyone my name is peter

157
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,800
schwaber i'm a researcher at the max

158
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,080
planck institute for security and

159
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,840
privacy in bochum

160
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,160
and well i think i can say that i was

161
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,479
pretty heavily involved in this uh this

162
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,479
was quantum standardization project so i

163
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,240
was involved in seven of the submissions

164
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,440
originally

165
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,000
and now um out of the four

166
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,680
schemes that that now were selected for

167
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,759
standardization and co-author of three

168
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,600
another one now get advanced to round

169
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,759
four so i'm still somewhat involved

170
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,600
in the in the in the future of the

171
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,880
project

172
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,120
and um yeah so generally my my work is

173
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,160
mostly

174
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,240
on the say crypto engineering side of

175
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,960
pqc at the moment

176
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,919
thank you president so now michele

177
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,080
hello i'm michaela mosca i'm a professor

178
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,919
at the university of waterloo i also

179
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,639
lead our company evolution queue

180
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,199
i got into cryptography in the early 90s

181
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,880
trying to cryptanalyze public key

182
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,120
cryptography at the time

183
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,240
and then learned about quantum

184
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
algorithms which of course was going to

185
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,440
redefine

186
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,120
what it meant to be secure or not so i

187
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,800
worked in quantum algorithmics for many

188
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,160
years

189
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
i'm pretty excited about where that

190
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,440
field is going both the software and the

191
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,639
hardware

192
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,680
uh so my sort of focus these days is to

193
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,800
make sure

194
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,360
we sort of safely robustly migrate to

195
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,759
new cryptography that will be safe in

196
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,039
the guanamera obviously post quantum is

197
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,800
the bread and but you know is the

198
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,440
essential first layer of defense there

199
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
and you know two things we need to do

200
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
that not in a panic

201
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,400
so we don't make very rookie mistakes in

202
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,720
the deployment but also needs to be

203
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,360
resilient uh in case there's you know

204
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,919
unexpected uh breaks or problems that

205
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,759
emerge so what what are we gonna do then

206
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,199
that's why of course we need things like

207
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,400
agility and

208
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,199
potentially ukd and other mechanisms in

209
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,120
some cases so looking forward to this

210
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,720
discussion really great to reconnect

211
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,599
with

212
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,560
so many of you in person

213
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,240
thank you michael so now luca should be

214
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,240
online look are you there

215
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,800
i am can you hear me

216
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,319
yes yes

217
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,879
hi everyone i'm luca defeo researcher at

218
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,759
ibm research in zurich

219
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,479
i am one of the unlucky authors of psych

220
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,160
and yeah my involvement in the post

221
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
quantum research has been mostly around

222
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,759
isology-based cryptography so far

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,159
okay so thank you

224
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,360
um

225
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,958
so let's start

226
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,279
slowly um let's do the same question to

227
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,399
all four of you in turn it's a more

228
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,959
subjective question the the first one

229
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,800
just to set the tone

230
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,640
so what is your

231
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,519
personal view or opinion

232
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,839
uh about the standardization process

233
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,240
itself so it's like uh what kind of

234
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,040
opportunities you you see in this

235
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,160
process the challenges the need for for

236
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,320
this process so

237
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,000
justin would like to begin

238
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,880
yeah it's a good good first question um

239
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,279
i see the the standardization process is

240
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,839
a is a very exciting and a very

241
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,120
challenging

242
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,480
experience that we've been through for

243
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
the past several years and that will

244
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,959
continue to in the next few years

245
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,000
it's very

246
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,760
important and critical

247
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,200
the work that we're doing and we

248
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,360
appreciate the help that everyone who's

249
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,839
participating is definitely involved in

250
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,720
lots and lots of challenges

251
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,959
as a mathematician i had no idea that

252
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,040
patents and intellectual property would

253
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,360
play a big role in the whole process

254
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,120
like it has

255
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,519
there's been just a lot of

256
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,120
complex issues that we've had to deal

257
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,959
with we don't have a quantum computer

258
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,519
how do we measure quantum security how

259
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,680
do we measure a lattice scheme compared

260
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,480
to a misogyny scheme when they've got

261
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,040
different ways of measuring security

262
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,120
so lots of definite challenges but

263
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,600
overall uh happy with the way it's gone

264
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,680
there's been some ups and downs but

265
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,200
we've been able to kind of stick to our

266
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,959
overall timeline

267
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,440
and uh that we're still going to be able

268
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,480
to get out

269
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,959
the first post quantum standards by

270
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,720
about the time when we originally said

271
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,360
we would at the start of the project so

272
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,200
um lots of opportunities still in the

273
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,120
future lots of challenges so i'm sure

274
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,040
we'll encounter many many more but

275
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,720
overall i'm happy with the way things

276
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,040
are going

277
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,079
okay so as you said that this is a very

278
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,680
subjective question of course i can say

279
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,200
that i'm very happy with the outcome of

280
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,279
the standardization process so far

281
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,160
um

282
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
i think it was a quite impressive

283
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,800
experience so i think also for nist um

284
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,399
they've never done anything of that

285
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,920
scale before i mean there was the the

286
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,480
aes and the sha-3 standardization when

287
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,360
aes happened i did not exist in the

288
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,920
academic crypto community when star 3

289
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,600
happened i was mainly involved by

290
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
writing ramp session songs

291
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,480
so

292
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
for me this was really a first to be

293
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,959
involved and

294
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,880
well looking back i think

295
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,480
there was well it was

296
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,160
a few surprises in terms of like crypto

297
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,320
analytic results most impressively just

298
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,240
uh just very recently the the psych

299
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,040
result of course um there was not i

300
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,680
would say a lot of big surprises

301
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,360
for me in terms of what decisions were

302
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,519
being made um

303
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,839
i think it was mostly along the lines of

304
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,440
what i would expect it maybe not at the

305
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,839
very final decision completely but

306
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,680
um there's probably a few procedural

307
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,000
things where looking at it sort of from

308
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,920
the other side then you

309
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,040
where

310
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,480
i would suggest that if you had to do it

311
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,560
again there's details you could change

312
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,440
um

313
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,680
but overall yeah i think it went went

314
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,360
rather well

315
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,760
so far

316
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,000
yeah i mean i would agree despite you

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,839
know obviously obvious imperfections and

318
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,519
issues that arise here and there it's

319
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,279
going about as well as i would

320
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,279
realistically have expected so overall

321
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,279
i'm very pleased with we didn't know how

322
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,279
this would play out right so there's

323
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,200
many talented people all around the

324
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,360
world working really hard at making

325
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,800
these schemes

326
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
uh and i guess as we've learned there's

327
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,800
a few working on breaking them too

328
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,720
i was most worried about well i was

329
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,079
worried about both

330
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,519
but we definitely had a lot of really

331
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,800
talented people uh developing schemes

332
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,440
the breaking is as i've pointed out many

333
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,800
times before

334
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,560
the hard part because it's not very well

335
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,880
rewarded it's high risk high return

336
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,279
so many thanks to the colleagues who's

337
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,959
you know spent the time working on

338
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,480
breaking the various

339
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,639
uh schemes that have been broken into

340
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,480
some were just minor breaks which could

341
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,320
be easily patched others

342
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,240
not so minor uh so thanks to them um and

343
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,920
and then a really special thanks to

344
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,079
everyone who's been working on trying to

345
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,079
break these things failed and we don't

346
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,320
even know about it right and i think

347
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,399
that i would like to flag is a serious

348
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,920
concern

349
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,399
for the field going forward as we've now

350
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,200
learned

351
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,959
there is a non-zero chance of breaking

352
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,120
these schemes and we need to stay

353
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,720
diligent and make sure if there are

354
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,959
weaknesses it's discovered

355
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,959
by people who will

356
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,880
share those weaknesses and give us time

357
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,480
to fix them

358
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,320
so i don't have a solution i know in the

359
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
80s and 90s a lot of important

360
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,880
cryptanalysis was done in industry

361
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,639
so maybe there's a role for industry

362
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,079
here because it's not a great

363
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,880
proposition to a masters or phd student

364
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,560
to try something with a less than 10

365
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,480
percent chance of success

366
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,600
um tenured people maybe can work on it

367
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,720
uh and

368
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,399
and so on but i think that's that's a

369
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,240
really important challenge with no easy

370
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,720
solution but maybe there's a role for

371
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,320
industry here

372
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,839
to do some really intense script

373
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,399
analysis

374
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,880
thank you kelly so

375
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,760
look up your turn

376
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,040
i don't have much to add i agree with my

377
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,959
co-panelists

378
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,040
this was a very necessary process it has

379
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,240
brought

380
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,440
post-quantum cryptography in the

381
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,000
spotlight and generated a lot of very

382
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,839
interesting research some of which

383
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,360
probably wouldn't have happened without

384
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,120
it so it was uh

385
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,360
absolutely a great success in my opinion

386
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,680
then we can disagree with the process or

387
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,760
the outcomes but these are healthy

388
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,399
discussions that must been had but

389
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,160
from my personal point of view i think

390
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,120
it was well handled and

391
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,959
the outcomes

392
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,880
are satisfactory and will be very

393
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,560
important for the future

394
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,880
and what mikhail just said

395
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,560
resonates very much

396
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,880
to me

397
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,720
how are we well equipped and uh to uh to

398
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,480
work on crypto analysis and have we done

399
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,880
enough that's a question that we should

400
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,680
keep asking ourselves uh

401
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,440
what what are the opportunities for

402
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,920
academia for industry uh to work

403
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
together on keeping analyzing the

404
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,800
schemes in the future

405
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,040
thank you

406
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,600
so let's move on to

407
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,560
more

408
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,760
concrete

409
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,880
stuff here

410
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,240
um when the nist announced the

411
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,399
the first batch of algorithms to be

412
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,360
standardized and also the fourth round

413
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,880
uh finalists

414
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,399
there was a

415
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,680
footnote i mean i i hadn't noticed that

416
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,519
one until somebody noticed it and

417
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,839
discussion started

418
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,320
in the social network so it's actually

419
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,920
quite important

420
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,759
um it is

421
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,120
about patents

422
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,360
what is the current situation with

423
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,639
relation to kyber versus and true like

424
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,720
nist said that

425
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,160
this intends to standardize kyber unless

426
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,399
the patent situation is not resolved

427
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,440
until the end of this year and in that

428
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,279
case n2 would be chosen instead

429
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,199
so are there still

430
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,680
unsolved patent issues

431
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,560
and uh what's the point of view nice

432
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,000
point of view of

433
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,360
academia the

434
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,120
point of view of industry

435
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,920
so

436
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,240
perhaps dustin would like to

437
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,720
to begin

438
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,279
so it's a it's a

439
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,839
good question

440
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,440
um i shouldn't say too much because our

441
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,560
lawyers

442
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,000
don't want me to say much about the

443
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,839
patent situation until things are signed

444
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,839
and finalized um

445
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,160
we already announced with our when the

446
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,600
announcement came out that we reached

447
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
agreements with

448
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,240
tai ding in with cnrs to resolve some of

449
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,480
the the patent issues there

450
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,000
and that's what that footnote is dealing

451
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,160
with it says if we don't resolve those

452
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,120
then we could select entry instead

453
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,759
i don't anticipate that happening um

454
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,279
everything's gone as

455
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,040
as we expect it's just

456
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,880
just finalizing the last few things it

457
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,160
just takes a little bit longer because

458
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
we're working with lawyers and we're

459
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,959
working with an agency of a of another

460
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,160
country so it's just a little slower but

461
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,679
overall i'm happy with the outcome

462
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,000
and when we get everything signed and

463
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,839
you'll be able to see more i think most

464
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,799
people will be as well

465
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,599
then you know the panelists um want to

466
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,280
to comment about this

467
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,359
some other patent is discovered after

468
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,479
everything seems to be

469
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,480
stabilized and

470
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,320
and then

471
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,520
what what could happen

472
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,280
like

473
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,160
we know

474
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,400
one specific pattern and apparently it's

475
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,280
um it's going to be solved but what if

476
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,840
somebody else

477
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,240
shows up and say hey i have a patent

478
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,120
that covers this specific

479
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,480
aspect of one it doesn't even have to be

480
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,640
a hyper it could be any of the other

481
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,760
algorithms so a pattern that is still

482
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,039
um

483
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,400
unknown

484
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,520
people are waiting a chance to to to to

485
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,760
to make their their entrances and say

486
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
well here is a pattern that covers this

487
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,039
algorithm that has already been

488
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,559
standardized so the standard is

489
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,679
already published is there any

490
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,520
uh contingency

491
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,120
plan to what to do if this

492
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,160
turns out to be the case

493
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
maybe i'll just say one more about that

494
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,400
and welcome comments from anyone else

495
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,240
and that's that's another

496
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,360
good um reason to have more than one

497
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,120
algorithm standardized from the chem

498
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,880
category and from the digital signature

499
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,280
category with signatures we currently

500
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,679
have three with chems we have one and we

501
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,080
have four in the fourth round

502
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,039
so

503
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,720
if there is an unknown pattern that

504
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,880
comes up i mean it's hard to predict in

505
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,039
advance exactly how it would play out

506
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,039
but by having more than one um

507
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,640
standardized you can protect against

508
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,440
that

509
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,120
i mean and that's an that's a threat

510
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,760
that could exist as well with any crypto

511
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,400
system not just post quantum it could

512
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,880
occur with lightweight or symmetric or

513
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,120
even crypto that we are using today that

514
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,600
could always uh come up something but

515
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,679
it's a tough question it's it's

516
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,360
we try and plan for that and think about

517
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
what we can do but it's it's hard to

518
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
completely

519
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,120
protect against that possibility

520
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,000
yeah i mean i i guess i would just point

521
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,840
out i mean cryptography is not really a

522
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,160
nice to have in the modern era

523
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,000
it was already you know important in the

524
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,200
90s it's

525
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,960
even critical more critically important

526
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,720
today and going forward

527
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,160
so i think it'd be a really really

528
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,520
unfortunate

529
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,120
you know self-inflicted wound on

530
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,320
humanity

531
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,160
if we don't figure out a way to deploy

532
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,200
the best cryptography we possibly can

533
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,679
right because even a one percent loss

534
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,600
in not doing that is tremendous when you

535
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,200
figure out when you calculate what's at

536
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,559
stake so

537
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,559
i really hope that we

538
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,400
we take this as seriously as we do as a

539
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,679
community and

540
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,080
um and we really deploy the best crypto

541
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,000
we can and we don't have sort of

542
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,720
inappropriate reasons for deploying the

543
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,039
second or third best cryptography

544
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,120
because the stakes really are high and

545
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,440
should be taken seriously and escalated

546
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,600
if needed if things really start getting

547
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,440
going off the rails let's say but i

548
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
guess i'm hopeful that things will play

549
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,840
out well and everyone

550
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,959
is reasonable and fair

551
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
well let me um

552
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,640
suggest an an extension

553
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,960
along these the same line so there is

554
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,120
reason to have more than one algorithm

555
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,840
for each category standardized because

556
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,080
of this probably other reasons too um

557
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,320
and how about diversifying the

558
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,039
underlying security assumptions like we

559
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,960
have lattices we have

560
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,919
hash

561
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,880
and

562
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,600
we have the fourth round

563
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,320
code algorithms but it's only the

564
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,960
athleticist codes and and hash based

565
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,960
signatures um would it be interesting or

566
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,120
would there be any reason to

567
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,880
uh to to standardize something else like

568
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,120
until recently we we had

569
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,200
uh at least two more

570
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,240
uh

571
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,520
finalists

572
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,440
uh based on completely different

573
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,720
assumptions

574
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,600
um

575
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,440
so

576
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,960
what is the trade-off here like how

577
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,600
interesting would that be how

578
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,480
how much of a hindrance this would

579
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,360
be

580
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,440
in terms of standardized stuff we have

581
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,480
more variety there what are the pros and

582
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,840
cons

583
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,240
about this having more variety in the

584
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,919
underlying security assumptions

585
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,840
do you want to stop

586
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,520
sure i think it would be

587
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,039
very useful and interesting um to have

588
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,679
more diversification um we're glad that

589
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,600
we do have some diversification going

590
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,919
into the process we expected

591
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,919
submissions from various families but we

592
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,679
we also didn't know what else would come

593
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,640
out there

594
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,400
in the first round i think you saw some

595
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,000
interesting submissions as well that

596
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,919
were not lattice or code based or

597
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,159
multivariate

598
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,080
those didn't tend to survive too much

599
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,240
blasted

600
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,120
picnic sphynx plus

601
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,919
um so we we did have those we would

602
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,360
certainly like to encourage more

603
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,440
research get more diversity

604
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,600
post quantum standardization isn't going

605
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,679
to end in a year it's going to continue

606
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,240
on for for many many years and we do

607
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,480
need new research ideas and developing

608
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,480
new crypto systems so we definitely want

609
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,080
to encourage that

610
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,039
we also have to balance that with um

611
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,640
in order to have confidence in this

612
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,799
scheme it needs to be mature and have

613
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,720
been around for a while had lots of

614
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,919
analysis

615
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,559
so if there is a new idea you know it'll

616
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,559
take a number of years before we could

617
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,559
potentially standardize it

618
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,960
there's kind of a trade-off there we

619
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,200
hopefully will see a little bit um of

620
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,159
some new ideas in our our call for

621
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,320
additional signatures um

622
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,120
we expect some things but i i'm hopeful

623
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,640
that there will be some new ideas out

624
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,559
there as well it can start being

625
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,120
explored

626
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,240
so maybe uh to add to this i mean of

627
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,919
course it's good to have some diversity

628
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,880
and we've just seen now with with psych

629
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,039
that it is possible that actually

630
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,559
schemes get broken

631
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,640
um and then it's good to have a fallback

632
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,760
from a different realm with really

633
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,520
different assumptions maybe one

634
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,200
additional aspect

635
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,000
is from an engineering point of view

636
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,200
when you when you're looking at the

637
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,679
schemes then schemes based on on very

638
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,120
different assumptions also show really

639
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,919
different performance um characteristics

640
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,840
and um

641
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,720
i don't think we will end up well

642
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,159
it's a tough prediction but i don't

643
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,520
think we will ever end up with something

644
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,200
that is as nice as elliptic curve

645
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,360
cryptography is now pre-quantum wear you

646
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,440
just send 32 bytes this way 32 bytes

647
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,720
this way it's all very efficient you

648
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,960
have this one building block scalar

649
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,080
multiplication that you need to

650
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,240
implement and protect and everything

651
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,760
and um

652
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,480
so

653
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,679
that means that that different

654
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,360
applications may want to pick different

655
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,320
schemes

656
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,279
not just because of different

657
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,880
assumptions but actually because they

658
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,919
have different performance

659
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,640
characteristics one example would be

660
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,559
classic mcaleese which has really big

661
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,720
public keys but really small cipher text

662
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,440
so

663
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
if you don't need if you don't care

664
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
about the the big public keys then uh

665
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,960
well this is a actually a very

666
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,000
interesting

667
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,080
um tool to have in your belt to build

668
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,639
protocols

669
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,360
yeah i think adi shamir the fort

670
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,760
lauderdale meeting uh you know outlined

671
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,799
these three

672
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,039
you know tiers right the production

673
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,960
ready algorithms and then i forget what

674
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,400
the middle one was but somewhere between

675
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,880
that and just research exploratory we do

676
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,200
need those three tiers some balanced

677
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,039
portfolio of the three

678
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,880
and i think as a community we should be

679
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,120
respectful of all three tiers because i

680
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,799
think what often happens is that third

681
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,720
tier kind of gets dismissed you know

682
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,799
gets all their grant proposals rejected

683
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,720
and trashed and their papers get

684
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,039
rejected because nobody needs it and

685
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,640
you don't live up to the standards of

686
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,880
the stuff that's been around for decades

687
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,840
more

688
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,000
i guess that's human nature but maybe

689
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,600
and of course there has to be there are

690
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
standards even when you're doing more

691
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,360
exploratory research there's good and

692
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,200
there's bad research there

693
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,919
but

694
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,520
we need a balanced portfolio of those

695
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,640
three

696
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,840
for all the reasons i think we

697
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,919
appreciate but in practice since the

698
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,039
beginning of rsa when ecc was of course

699
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,679
who needs it and we can't trust it and

700
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,279
and then eventually ecc became

701
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,880
mainstream and then all the post bottom

702
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,400
schemes were kind of

703
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,159
the ugly ducklings

704
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,000
and now you know we should just it's

705
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,919
going to continue but i think we do

706
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,240
really need to support and nurture

707
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,200
because there aren't really what are

708
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,919
they all you know we really is um

709
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,600
really profound fun well research to

710
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,039
find alternatives

711
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,640
and they need to be kind of nurtured and

712
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,559
appreciated in there

713
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,480
in a different way than of course the

714
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,400
mainstream production brain

715
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,840
cryptography is

716
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,679
local would you like to

717
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,760
make some comments

718
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,080
hi as usual i find myself agreeing with

719
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,159
the other panelists on

720
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,000
everything um

721
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,760
it's certainly very necessary that we

722
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,120
diversify our assumptions and

723
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,360
we cannot expect all the assumptions to

724
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,120
be at the same level of

725
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,360
production readiness

726
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,279
so i guess what would help would also be

727
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,360
to have some clarity on

728
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,880
how the community

729
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,200
nist but not only is of course intends

730
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,000
to

731
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,240
uh keep this process going in the next

732
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
years because so far we've been learning

733
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,000
about the next round and then the next

734
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,880
round

735
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,360
but like is there going to be

736
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
in this post-quantum process in 10 years

737
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,919
from now like what's our timeline

738
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,679
uh this would be something that as a

739
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,520
community we should

740
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,279
we should come to decide in some way

741
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,279
thank you so um

742
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,000
let me in the same context

743
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,520
um let me describe a situation here um

744
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,400
imagine that we already have the publish

745
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,399
standard okay this is the very first

746
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,200
batch of standardized

747
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,640
algorithms

748
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,480
um possibly

749
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,520
the the the next batch as well so it's

750
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
some point in the future

751
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,799
the near future one two years from now

752
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:33,679
um

753
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,799
so we have

754
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,320
a selection of post quantum alternatives

755
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,120
to

756
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,000
the the kind of cryptography we use

757
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,200
today

758
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,520
um but we are still using like elliptic

759
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,720
curves we are still using rsa

760
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,880
so there are several

761
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,159
viewpoints here that could be taken one

762
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,880
is well we have a new standard

763
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,000
uh that offers alternatives if

764
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,279
or when

765
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,480
uh quantum computers become a threat but

766
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,440
let's

767
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,039
keep this as a

768
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,240
um

769
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,520
like a backup plan let's keep using

770
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,320
elliptic curves and rsa in that this is

771
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,200
one point of view a completely different

772
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,559
one

773
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,600
the opposite point of view is well uh

774
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,320
let's migrate away from elliptic verbs

775
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,600
and rsa

776
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,559
now

777
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,919
immediately

778
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,399
let's not wait for quantum computers to

779
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,960
become a technical

780
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,559
reality like could be 50 years from now

781
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,240
it's important that we are prepared

782
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,640
right now so let's migrate

783
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,279
now let's forget about everything that

784
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,080
is being used today and

785
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,520
move to this new selection of algorithms

786
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,600
and there is like any number of

787
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,840
viewpoints in between those like for

788
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,159
instance we could try and adopt hybrid

789
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,399
schemes let's let's encrypt everything

790
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,919
using elliptic curves and lattices so if

791
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,240
any one of these two is broken there is

792
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,399
still another layer here there are pros

793
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,559
and cons

794
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,440
so

795
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,080
the question here is

796
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,320
what is your view about this

797
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,279
um

798
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,240
which

799
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,919
position along this range would you put

800
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,480
yourself in like should we

801
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,039
keep the new post quantum algorithms as

802
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,000
a backup or should we migrate

803
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,559
immediately or something in between

804
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,480
hybrid approach what do what are your

805
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,640
views about

806
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,799
this

807
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,039
back

808
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,399
i can start so you probably are aware

809
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,080
that the question about hybrids has

810
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,760
recently been referred to as opening

811
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,200
pandora's box

812
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,520
on the pkc forum um

813
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,600
my opinion is that we should do hybrid

814
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,200
we should um

815
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
migrate to the new algorithms as soon as

816
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,000
possible but we should do it always in

817
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,080
in conjunction with the currently

818
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,320
deployed cryptography

819
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,559
um

820
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,559
with elliptic curve crypto i think we've

821
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,600
we have

822
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,640
really a very very stable foundation um

823
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,480
crypto analysis is

824
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,840
really well understood i think everyone

825
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,039
here in the room

826
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,399
probably everyone here in the room would

827
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,120
be majorly surprised if

828
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,799
the elliptic curve discrete logarithm

829
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,279
problem turned out to be insecure with

830
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,120
like not taking quantum computers into

831
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,159
account

832
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,000
and there's also performance argument to

833
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,480
be made here so if you're um if you're

834
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,960
looking at say combination of kyber

835
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,960
with some elliptic curve diffie-hellman

836
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,880
kyber is faster so if you're using

837
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,159
elliptic curved if you helmet now

838
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,039
if you throw kyber on top of this then

839
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,880
it's not becoming slower even by a

840
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,960
factor of two it's actually maybe a

841
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,279
factor one and a half slower in terms of

842
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,960
sizes if you're migrating to post

843
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,360
quantum crypto anyway which you have to

844
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,440
um and you're transmitting roughly a

845
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,080
kilobyte each way then adding 32 bytes

846
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,679
on this on top for elliptic curve is

847
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,200
also not going to make a huge difference

848
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,159
and

849
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,559
um i think it's a it's a no-brainer that

850
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,559
you should do hybrid but don't you think

851
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,399
this would cause problems for a highly

852
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,039
heterogeneous network like you have

853
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,559
powerful servers here if you have uh

854
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,840
like

855
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,880
very constrained platforms elsewhere

856
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,919
so

857
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,080
even a factor of 1.5 like if processing

858
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,200
times

859
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,880
become 50 longer if bandwidth occupation

860
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
becomes 50

861
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,559
uh larger this could be a hindrance

862
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,120
so do you think there's a

863
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,360
justification like even so which we

864
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,200
should try to to migrate away or or look

865
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,640
for a hybrid approach right now even in

866
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,679
in this scenario yes so what would you

867
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,360
say to those

868
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,720
people who

869
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
who have to face this like

870
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,840
it's on your own or is there a way of

871
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,440
overcoming this

872
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,760
difficulty so so i think really the

873
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,919
constraint is going to be in particular

874
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,679
in the embedded world is going to be

875
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:10,880
banned with

876
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,200
maybe memory requirements

877
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,600
and if you migrate into post quantum

878
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,840
crypto which you have to do anyway then

879
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,039
it's not a factor of 1.5 but it's adding

880
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,760
32 bytes on top of a kilobyte and yes

881
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,960
they can probably come up with some

882
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,960
application where these 32 bytes exactly

883
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,640
make the difference between

884
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,320
fitting into a packet or not fitting

885
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,760
into a packet but but really the

886
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,360
overhead in terms of bandwidth

887
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,080
requirements from doing post quantum or

888
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,600
post quantum plus ecc they're so small

889
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,480
that

890
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
yeah for me this is pretty much of a

891
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,240
no-brainer and yeah i mean we are in a

892
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,080
field where 10 performance improvement

893
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,360
gives you a chest paper but um

894
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,880
still

895
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,399
this is for me this is clear

896
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,559
yeah yeah i mean i agree with peter i

897
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,000
mean in the vast majority of

898
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,320
circumstances the return on investment

899
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,399
calculation based on what i know and i

900
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,320
think we know on the outside

901
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,120
is clear there is an investment uh that

902
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,720
is a little more complicated but it's

903
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
not that complicated we know how to

904
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,440
combine two things well i think

905
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,840
and so on so there's a bit of cost but

906
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
we're mitigating what risks the risk

907
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
that there's a classical break

908
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,120
of lattices that doesn't break ecc

909
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,880
so until somebody proves a theorem that

910
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,760
says

911
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,440
break if you break lattices you also

912
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,120
break ecc

913
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,360
i think there's certainly value now

914
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,960
there are going to be some resource

915
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,799
constrained situations where there you

916
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,640
have maybe the roi calculation is

917
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,399
different there's a whole lightweight

918
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,519
crypto

919
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,320
you know challenge and so on but that's

920
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,960
that so have that discussion there but

921
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,720
in the vast majority of

922
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,480
you know cases

923
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,159
i agree with uh

924
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,399
with data

925
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,720
yeah um nist already in our

926
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,000
856c we accommodate a way to do a hybrid

927
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,240
combined shared secrets and then run it

928
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,159
through a kdf so

929
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,079
you can still get phipps approval on the

930
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,918
standardized part so

931
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,520
we have already taken steps to

932
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,918
accommodate a way to do a kind of a

933
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,320
hybrid way of combining post quantum or

934
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,560
even any other method

935
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,040
with a currently classical standardized

936
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,800
algorithm

937
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,879
it makes sense to us that hybrid you

938
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,599
know that that hedges against some risks

939
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,560
there are some pros and cons

940
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,079
our nccoe project is

941
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,320
is also right now developing a kind of a

942
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,560
short white paper that will

943
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,480
explain a lot of those advantages and

944
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,639
disadvantages so that people are aware

945
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,560
of all the information and that they

946
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,239
could make their own decisions if they

947
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,839
need to or or not

948
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,639
um that should come out pretty soon

949
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,320
um we've seen a lot of discussion on the

950
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,639
pqc forum we're discussing it internally

951
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,640
at nist and to most of us it makes a lot

952
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,960
of sense that hybrid is a is a good way

953
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,400
to protect

954
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,280
as

955
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,560
as we move forward through the

956
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,960
transition

957
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,200
we don't currently see our role as nist

958
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,440
needs to kind of require it or bake it

959
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,839
into the standard

960
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,960
nist usually standardizes primitives and

961
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,440
then organizations and companies can

962
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,640
decide to use those in their protocols

963
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,760
and other standards groups other bodies

964
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,520
can develop hybrid

965
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,960
hybrid modes

966
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,520
and and we encourage that so

967
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,119
right now that's kind of how

968
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,040
we see it at nist i would say

969
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,160
would you like to comment

970
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,119
um

971
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,240
i find myself mostly agreeing um

972
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,000
it's uh

973
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,160
we know that it makes no sense to uh to

974
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,040
wait we need to migrate uh pretty soon

975
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,560
especially as far as encryption is

976
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,760
concerned

977
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
we may have a little bit more leeway for

978
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
signatures it's fine to wait a little

979
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,520
bit that the situation settles but for

980
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,839
encryption uh we need to protect against

981
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:04,800
the uh

982
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,599
record now the crypto leader menace so

983
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,400
uh

984
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,720
hybrid is the only solution like it's uh

985
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,920
it's clear that we want to have hybrid

986
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,160
where i disagree is that it's not nist

987
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,960
rule to standardize a hybrid

988
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,400
um

989
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,760
because i have the impression that lots

990
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,320
of people think that it's something

991
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,400
obvious and trivial and it's true that

992
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,079
conceptual is not difficult to get a

993
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,119
hybrid

994
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,520
but still there's so many subtle ways in

995
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,320
which

996
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,560
one could speak very much

997
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,560
i have a question about the experiment

998
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,280
splitting so here you compare

999
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,359
the attack with exhaustive search but

1000
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,359
you talk about rsa so why do you compare

1001
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,319
to exhaustive search

1002
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,440
what's happening

1003
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,079
probably

1004
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,599
just uh just a second uh look uh we have

1005
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,599
a technical issue

1006
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,599
a fault injection is it was set here

1007
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,400
of rejection in the denial of service

1008
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,680
please repeat the last few seconds

1009
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,520
yeah what was i yeah i was saying that

1010
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,400
uh

1011
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,880
i think it's not as trivial as some

1012
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,359
people seem to think making a hybrid

1013
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,920
uh there are some subtleties ways in

1014
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,560
which you can screw things and

1015
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,320
it's uh

1016
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,079
it's important that

1017
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,440
that we

1018
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,280
we have standards also for every

1019
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,760
encryption um whether they must be

1020
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,079
coupled with the precise pair of systems

1021
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,320
like we need a standard that has hybrid

1022
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,000
plus ecc

1023
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,400
or we have a standard for

1024
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,320
making hybrids from generic uh cams um

1025
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,400
one or the other but we do need it and

1026
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,880
it's it's a topic which uh

1027
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,440
requires some research uh from the

1028
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,800
theoretical perspective but also from

1029
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,320
the side channel perspective in my

1030
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,560
opinion

1031
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,000
thank you so um just to to to make

1032
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,440
things clear in the same context here um

1033
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,119
there is the other side of this issue

1034
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,079
um as we have more algorithms being

1035
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,760
standardized like four or four

1036
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
signatures we have already

1037
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,200
three possibilities if my account is

1038
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,320
correct

1039
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,119
um and there is this new call for short

1040
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,480
signatures

1041
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,079
so from the point of view of um

1042
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,160
industry or somebody who is able to

1043
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,040
deploy the standard

1044
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,400
i'm sorry

1045
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,359
um

1046
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,720
this could be

1047
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,960
a a problem like are we going to

1048
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,599
have to implement everything to have

1049
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,839
everything

1050
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,440
prepared uh

1051
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,640
or

1052
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,280
more specifically about like round three

1053
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,720
versus round four algorithms um isn't it

1054
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,480
the case that

1055
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,960
round four algorithms will conflict with

1056
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,920
a very deployment of round three or vice

1057
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,320
versa like if somebody is already

1058
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,720
implementing round three standardized

1059
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,720
algorithms will they

1060
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,040
bother about implementing round four as

1061
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,000
well

1062
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,640
uh isn't there a chance or this new call

1063
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,359
for signatures isn't there a chance that

1064
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,280
people will simply say well yeah okay

1065
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,040
that's a curiosity but

1066
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,480
only this

1067
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,599
so let's simply ignore anything else

1068
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,839
from this point on we already have the

1069
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,800
solution to to to our needs is there

1070
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,520
this risk it's it's the the opposite of

1071
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,680
having uh more diversity like uh

1072
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,280
it's uh the the other side of this point

1073
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,400
so any any

1074
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,040
comments about this

1075
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,480
dusting

1076
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,920
kelly

1077
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,800
sure

1078
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,640
or go ahead i'm just gonna say it's a

1079
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,760
good question

1080
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,119
because you know this is sort of a

1081
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,119
resource oriented uh

1082
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,640
you know conference and

1083
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,000
and community

1084
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,440
but you know the

1085
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,760
people doing real world deployment

1086
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,440
because the best securities to security

1087
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,040
that's actually deployed

1088
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,000
and

1089
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,240
and used they would love to have

1090
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,079
one algorithm they wish this was a

1091
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,720
competition we picked the winner we

1092
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,400
better we promised that it was never

1093
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,560
going to be broken and then they could

1094
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,560
deploy the hell out of it and optimize

1095
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,839
it and

1096
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,040
that that's what they would like but

1097
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,200
unfortunately sometimes you know life

1098
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,960
sucks and you you can't have everything

1099
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,560
you'd like so we don't have that level

1100
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,319
of certainty so now we're trying to

1101
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,599
navigate

1102
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,680
the realities of well we don't

1103
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,280
there is uncertainty and they don't like

1104
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,200
uncertainty and the more uncertainty

1105
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
there is the harder less confidence

1106
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,480
they'll be in deploying so the less

1107
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,079
they'll be deployment

1108
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,400
so we have to navigate that

1109
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,000
carefully and try to find a nice sweet

1110
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
spot for them because they don't want i

1111
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,520
think brian and i were at a conference

1112
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,040
just for the pandemic where somebody was

1113
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,040
saying i don't want five options you

1114
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,240
give me five options it's gonna be a

1115
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,480
nightmare for me i want one option and

1116
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,760
maybe two

1117
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,280
i don't know the answer but it's we

1118
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,040
should you know discuss it and engage

1119
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,760
with

1120
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,359
people on the front lines of deploying

1121
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,040
to see where that sweet spot is

1122
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,319
yeah brian raised this point i may have

1123
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,000
been the same workshop there where he

1124
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,280
mentioned having waves of

1125
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,760
standardization and that that that's

1126
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,359
definitely a challenge for industry and

1127
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,720
adoption

1128
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,240
because they might want to wait for the

1129
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,720
next best thing or wait till it's done

1130
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,640
to to implement everything

1131
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,040
yeah we understand that concern um like

1132
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,880
mckelly said that's that's a challenge

1133
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,560
that we need to discuss and try and come

1134
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,800
up with a good solution

1135
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
um we try to

1136
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,640
signal or make clear in our announcement

1137
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,319
that we expect kind of kyber and

1138
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,400
dilithium to be the two main algorithms

1139
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,880
that people should implement

1140
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,400
hopefully we can get that message out

1141
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,319
there

1142
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,240
you probably want to be ready to not

1143
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,079
implement just those because we do need

1144
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,599
diversity and we do need to have other

1145
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,119
algorithms out there

1146
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,200
but like mckelly said we don't want to

1147
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,640
have too many out there with ecc we had

1148
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,880
15 curves and

1149
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,200
all 15 aren't deployed there's only two

1150
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,960
or three that end up getting used so a

1151
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,240
small number is good for

1152
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,000
interoperability so we need to have a

1153
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,160
few but not too many

1154
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,520
and try and get the message out there

1155
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,280
what are the main ones that we we do

1156
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,319
want people to adopt

1157
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,599
yes for me i mean i'm an academic who

1158
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,800
has never worked in the industry so

1159
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,400
maybe what i'm saying doesn't make any

1160
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,920
sense but it's probably a bit of a

1161
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,839
question of what the cost is to

1162
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,839
implement an additional scheme so if you

1163
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,680
look at crypto libraries and written in

1164
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,160
software um i would believe that when

1165
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,000
this at some point standardizes more

1166
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,079
cams for example after round four

1167
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,520
there will be high quality

1168
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,200
implementations of those also ending up

1169
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,839
in like typical crypto libraries

1170
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:06,640
um

1171
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,240
if a company has already rolled out

1172
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,720
millions of smart cards for example with

1173
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,560
hardware accelerators and everything

1174
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,800
they're probably not gonna produce very

1175
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,119
quickly another generation um with the

1176
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,040
new algorithms additionally

1177
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,839
uh on those

1178
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,640
google would like to

1179
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,520
add

1180
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,880
or yeah just a few words uh

1181
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,440
it's uh the risk you presented it's uh

1182
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,599
it's clear and i have no doubt that

1183
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,119
people will rush to implement the

1184
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,040
selected standards and then we'll have

1185
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,880
much less motivation to

1186
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,480
eventually implement what will come out

1187
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,079
from the next rounds it's uh it's

1188
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,839
obvious and it's legitimate because it

1189
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,440
costs money

1190
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,800
unless it's just a small software

1191
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,319
development doing some professional

1192
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,400
critical deployment costs lots of

1193
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,960
efforts resources to make

1194
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,359
so uh we should expect this to happen

1195
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,079
and i suppose it's the responsibility of

1196
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,880
industry to find the right balance i

1197
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,560
don't think this is a situation similar

1198
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,560
to what we have in ecc

1199
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,800
because sure in ecc you have many curves

1200
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,359
but you expect that they are all equally

1201
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,119
safe it's just more a matter of choice

1202
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,760
and maybe details on side channel uh

1203
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,359
and as long as it's just details on the

1204
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,160
channel you can choose which one is best

1205
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,920
for your particular application but here

1206
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,280
we are talking about

1207
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,960
complete families of scheme which of

1208
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,800
which one may end up being broken and we

1209
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,040
may have to replace really fast

1210
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,319
so of course this this is the

1211
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,319
responsibility of industry that's going

1212
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,200
to uh do efforts on crypto agility and

1213
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,760
it's i guess the responsibility of

1214
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,920
companies who can afford the cost

1215
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,079
like make the cost risk analysis and

1216
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,599
afford the cost to implement additional

1217
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,839
selected finalists which will be

1218
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,000
selected in the next rounds to have them

1219
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,200
ready for

1220
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,040
quick deployment if something really bad

1221
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,440
happens

1222
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,839
thank you

1223
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,599
um

1224
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,800
so um let me ask about this a new call

1225
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,400
for signatures

1226
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,880
what exactly it will be expected

1227
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,160
uh from this new process like is there

1228
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,040
anything already in mind we'll miss

1229
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,560
consider or reconsider uh schemes based

1230
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,599
on multivariate quadratic um

1231
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,040
assumptions

1232
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,480
or something more arcane like a braid

1233
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,319
groups or

1234
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,079
whatever like so

1235
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,280
what is

1236
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,079
expected from this this this new call

1237
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,920
so and hopefully by the way the call

1238
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,680
should our goal is to get it out by the

1239
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,319
end of august so um it'll be pretty

1240
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,920
similar to the original call for

1241
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,760
proposals just modified for for

1242
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,200
signatures

1243
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,520
but again our main reason for this call

1244
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,480
is

1245
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,560
we did select three

1246
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,720
three signature schemes two are based on

1247
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,680
lattices and sphinx plus is not

1248
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,599
sphynx plus isn't as

1249
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,680
is friendly performance wise for most

1250
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,040
applications

1251
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,920
so our main goal is to get another

1252
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,480
digital signature scheme that can be

1253
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,680
used

1254
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,000
widely for most applications that's not

1255
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,680
based on lattices

1256
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,800
so that's our primary goal

1257
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,520
that said we will accept any submission

1258
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,480
um

1259
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,720
that's what we're looking for if there's

1260
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,800
application or if there's

1261
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,640
signature systems that have particularly

1262
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,160
short signatures

1263
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,079
that's probably of interest to us as

1264
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,599
well with fast verification

1265
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,760
this process we don't expect it to be as

1266
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,119
big as what we've been doing the past

1267
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,920
six years so if a ton of submissions get

1268
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,400
sent in we'll probably quickly narrow it

1269
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,839
down and say these are the ones that we

1270
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,319
want to focus on

1271
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,560
so yeah there could be multivariate i'm

1272
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,400
expecting there's probably some misogyny

1273
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,319
signatures probably some code based

1274
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,760
signatures

1275
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,520
i wouldn't surprise me that there's some

1276
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,440
lattice-based signatures submitted even

1277
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,599
though that's kind of not our primary

1278
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,680
target that we're looking for

1279
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,839
if they are compelling enough and offer

1280
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,720
enough of a performance advantage maybe

1281
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,280
we could consider it

1282
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,040
possibly some new ideas if it's a new

1283
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,200
idea would probably still need to take a

1284
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,720
number of years before we could have

1285
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,640
confidence in it

1286
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,520
but

1287
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,920
yeah expecting to see probably a variety

1288
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,119
of different ideas

1289
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,680
or michelle or comment on this like oh

1290
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,839
could be from the point of view of uh

1291
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,520
academia as well like well more

1292
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,359
opportunities to

1293
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,319
to to do research and publish papers

1294
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,319
and things like this

1295
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,960
um do you feel that

1296
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,599
uh let's pick one uh

1297
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,760
uh at random here like permuted kernels

1298
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,240
signatures based on the the permuted

1299
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,000
kernels assumption

1300
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,520
do you think this would be mature

1301
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,119
for a

1302
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,599
standardization proposal

1303
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,040
or

1304
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,480
do you think that

1305
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,319
any any proposal

1306
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,200
to be submitted will be based on like

1307
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,960
codes and isogenies and

1308
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,240
possibly

1309
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,119
lattices as well so would it be

1310
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,200
more of the same or do you expect to see

1311
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,520
new stuff

1312
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,000
it's hard to make predictions especially

1313
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,119
about the future well it is but this is

1314
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,599
very purpose um this discussion so i

1315
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,760
wouldn't be surprised if there are some

1316
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,920
more proposals submitted outside of that

1317
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,040
like

1318
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,440
more or less well-known realms

1319
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,640
um

1320
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,520
if nist then decides to admit those as

1321
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,280
you said probably depends on how many

1322
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,280
there are and how crazy they are

1323
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,720
um

1324
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,800
that that i can't tell but i wouldn't

1325
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,800
i would not be

1326
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,440
in the in the first

1327
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,599
so 2017 when when all the schemes came

1328
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,599
in i mean everybody expected lots

1329
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,200
multivariate code based letters based

1330
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,520
essentially hash based but then if you

1331
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,040
remember this overview table that i

1332
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,559
think at the time jacob opera and

1333
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,240
sheriff tweeted like four days after the

1334
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,880
deadline there was i don't know

1335
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,400
12 14 categories something like this um

1336
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,480
so yeah it would be

1337
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,720
depending on how openly this call is

1338
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,200
being being phrased i would believe that

1339
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,559
there's a few more

1340
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,079
proposals that are just out there

1341
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,160
any more comments

1342
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,520
okay um if i may oh please go ahead i

1343
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,480
say a word yeah um

1344
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,960
i expect indeed uh what everyone expects

1345
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,880
some more based on multivariate some

1346
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,480
more business rgb somewhere based on

1347
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,599
code based

1348
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,720
i would also like to point out that

1349
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,160
these different schemes these different

1350
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,480
scenario schemes are not on the same

1351
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,119
trajectory in terms of maturity

1352
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,319
and

1353
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:57,680
here is where maybe nist should be

1354
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,280
maybe more clear on what the plans for

1355
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,200
the future are because right now the

1356
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,599
message that dustin has just given and

1357
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,000
that's coherent with what was said in

1358
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,160
the past is that they're not looking for

1359
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,000
something on the same scale as the three

1360
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,800
rounds that we've been through so far

1361
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,400
and there are some things and some

1362
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,160
systems for which

1363
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,400
i think that three or more rounds may be

1364
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,359
necessary to gain confidence

1365
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,160
um

1366
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,200
so it's it would be helpful to to have

1367
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,000
some vision of how this post-quantum

1368
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,680
standardization process is going to go

1369
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,440
on in the next

1370
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,440
on the long term in the next

1371
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,920
five to ten years

1372
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,040
because

1373
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,800
because that impacts a lot the choices

1374
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,559
that are made for the system some

1375
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,400
systems are

1376
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,240
maybe very mature and ready for

1377
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,720
standardization some others may be some

1378
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,960
promising research level systems

1379
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,520
and we need to know how to address like

1380
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,680
these three tiers that mikhail and i

1381
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,599
have mentioned before

1382
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,359
we need to do research on all this and

1383
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,800
we need to encourage research and all of

1384
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,319
this

1385
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:01,920
yeah so

1386
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,480
on that note i think if we want to

1387
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,000
encourage

1388
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,440
people to do some of this more

1389
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,400
exploratory cryptographic research

1390
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,839
having some sort of nist process

1391
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,319
really helps legitimize uh that activity

1392
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,480
to their departments to the funding

1393
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,480
agencies they're applying to otherwise

1394
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,000
it looks like why are you working on i

1395
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,319
mean you will definitely get referees

1396
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,160
writing you nasty reports saying this is

1397
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,920
a waste of time because there's already

1398
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,440
standardized stuff

1399
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,440
so if there's an exist ongoing process

1400
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,119
then it gives you a little more of a

1401
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,800
fighting chance to support that kind of

1402
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,240
work it should still be high caliber

1403
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,240
work it can't be yet another braid

1404
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,240
scheme that was already broken

1405
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,000
but i mean if it's really novel and

1406
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,839
there's something to it then it should

1407
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:48,599
be supported in some disciplined way

1408
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,800
just to respond to luke a little bit

1409
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,839
um

1410
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,040
so i

1411
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,640
as i see it right now on this could all

1412
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,440
change the fourth round will will end

1413
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,000
the process for kind of chems um we'll

1414
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,760
select things or we'll be done with

1415
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,680
chems at the end of that point

1416
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,480
and that will kind of end the initial

1417
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,400
effort that we made

1418
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,319
we also started this additional copper

1419
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:13,520
signatures

1420
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,000
that will probably be going on for a few

1421
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,800
years um

1422
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,559
likely more than one round it kind of

1423
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,559
depends on what is submitted

1424
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,240
if there's a scheme that's already very

1425
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,640
very mature it could potentially need a

1426
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,319
little bit less time

1427
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,160
but i think we're anticipating this

1428
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,079
additional call for signatures going on

1429
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:32,880
for

1430
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,880
a few rounds a number of years so that

1431
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,480
we can make sure that we have confidence

1432
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,559
in it

1433
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,960
those are the only currently

1434
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,880
current plans that we have regarding

1435
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,480
standardization

1436
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,880
with specific plans in place i

1437
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,200
anticipate post quantum standardization

1438
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,040
is going to continue on for for many

1439
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,880
many years and we might come up with new

1440
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,000
plans

1441
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,599
um but those are the only kind of

1442
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,359
existing ones that we've announced plans

1443
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,839
for at this

1444
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:02,079
point i maybe directly ask you um how

1445
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,160
long you're planning round four to run

1446
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,440
like again like one and a half years

1447
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,559
roughly or yeah it'd probably be

1448
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,079
similar to the other rounds i'd say

1449
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,839
probably it's closer to two years just

1450
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,599
because we made the announcement we're

1451
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,280
working on the standard so it will just

1452
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,119
add a little bit more time to it but

1453
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,720
roughly about the same length thanks

1454
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,520
okay so um

1455
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,040
how about

1456
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,839
psych

1457
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,760
anyone would

1458
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,800
who's that question for

1459
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,640
um

1460
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,960
well you've all seen the the noise on

1461
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,960
imprint and on

1462
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,720
on social media

1463
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,599
uh yeah there is no doubt psych is that

1464
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,400
there is no obvious way to to solve it

1465
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,280
psych

1466
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,880
there may be some

1467
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,240
expensive ways which there are already

1468
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,680
some preprints that have appeared on

1469
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,839
eprint which suggests ways to modify

1470
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,880
this idh that should be safe and

1471
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,760
my intuition is that they would be safe

1472
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,040
if i understand well enough this new

1473
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,359
line of attacks has been developed

1474
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,079
but those are nowhere near the uh

1475
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,040
efficiency profile of psych so they

1476
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,760
they are probably not mature uh

1477
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,359
enough for

1478
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,359
for thinking of using them in practice

1479
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,640
so we are

1480
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,400
as far as isogeny based camps uh go uh

1481
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,520
we are back to uh to square wall maybe

1482
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,280
not one but square two

1483
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,520
where we need to think again about uh

1484
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,119
how to make hydrogen-based scans

1485
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,839
efficient

1486
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,920
there's lots of different other isogen

1487
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,960
essentials of course and different

1488
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,799
hazardous schemes which are all the

1489
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,559
different levels of

1490
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,640
being usable and interesting but that's

1491
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,920
a wider

1492
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,799
discourse

1493
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,359
i mean i mean overall i think we want to

1494
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:58,079
encourage more psych-like efforts right

1495
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,160
that's what we want so this is a success

1496
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,000
i mean this is this was a very

1497
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,440
disciplined

1498
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,559
very novel these were top cryptographers

1499
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,720
uh doing very novel creative

1500
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,640
cryptography

1501
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,400
and then some smart people found a

1502
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,079
really novel way

1503
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,480
like so it wasn't sloppy stuff it was

1504
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,559
very well done and somebody had to

1505
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,000
really come up with something creative

1506
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,319
to break it that's really good for the

1507
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,160
field of cryptography this new

1508
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,240
cryptanalysis

1509
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,000
and we want more of that so we want

1510
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,359
someone to

1511
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,799
follow that template in a sense and

1512
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,079
hopefully

1513
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,480
it isn't broken um

1514
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,200
so i think overall this was part of the

1515
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,480
the process i don't want to call it a

1516
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,760
game because it makes it sound trivial

1517
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,040
but it's part of

1518
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,520
the the pro the necessary process

1519
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,599
to build uh reliable trustworthy

1520
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,480
cryptography

1521
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,559
yeah maybe i may be sounding i may be

1522
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,960
sounding sad but i'm not to be honest

1523
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,200
this was a great journey and if my voice

1524
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,720
sounds a bit depressing just that it's

1525
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,200
35 degree outside and

1526
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,680
i'm suffering but

1527
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,680
no no this uh

1528
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,440
this was a very important effort and

1529
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,119
psych has given so much to the exogenous

1530
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,119
community and lots of what we're doing

1531
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,119
right now in his opinion this research

1532
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,680
comes out stands out from psych so it's

1533
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,200
uh

1534
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,240
no one should feel ashamed or sorry for

1535
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,000
us and yeah if you have new ideas uh

1536
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,079
definitely they must be shown to uh to

1537
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,480
the world

1538
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,599
yeah i think it's also an important

1539
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,119
reminder to the whole community that

1540
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,799
these things can happen and they do

1541
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,200
happen even with schemes that

1542
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,000
you know

1543
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,920
actually i think most people have been

1544
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,079
gaining some confidence in by now it's

1545
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,520
the only scheme that during the

1546
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,440
competition at some point that we can

1547
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,040
pick smaller parameters because attacks

1548
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,319
are actually more

1549
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,400
costly than we thought they are

1550
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,000
and um

1551
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,160
yeah i think it's uh

1552
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,760
it's good to take that lesson as a

1553
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,240
community

1554
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,079
and we get asked about that a lot right

1555
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,400
now where um people are noticing the

1556
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,680
attack on psych and they're saying well

1557
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,440
does this throw off the process or does

1558
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,359
it shake confidence and

1559
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,040
like spin said this is part of the

1560
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,799
process every round there have been

1561
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,400
schemes that have been attacked or

1562
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,520
broken and

1563
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,280
that's the way it works we encourage

1564
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,000
that and it's the ones that survive that

1565
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,400
we have confidence in um

1566
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,160
sure it was a little surprising when it

1567
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,599
kind of right after the announcement

1568
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,440
psych was attacked and broken

1569
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,599
but that's just the way

1570
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,400
the standardization process works so if

1571
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,319
if that happens we won't select it but

1572
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,319
it doesn't throw off the entire process

1573
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,520
it does remind us of that lesson that

1574
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,680
certainly a scheme can be broken an idea

1575
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,440
can come at any time where someone will

1576
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,280
break something and that's true of all

1577
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,760
cryptography again as well so

1578
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,520
definitely something to keep in mind

1579
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,280
post quantum crypto is still a very

1580
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,280
active research field and new results

1581
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,079
will continue to come

1582
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,240
so um

1583
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,480
still in in the same context i'll

1584
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,000
make a few statements completely

1585
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,640
or more or less hypothetical and then

1586
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,799
i'll ask a question

1587
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:11,599
um

1588
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,920
so first scenario and first statements

1589
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,319
to to consider like about

1590
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,160
25 years ago

1591
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,400
uh anomalous elliptic curves had been

1592
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,040
proposed for actual deployment because

1593
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,839
they are particularly efficient

1594
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:29,599
and then an attack was found like a

1595
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:32,559
polynomial time attack against anomalous

1596
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:33,680
curves

1597
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,240
so the statement here is elliptic curve

1598
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,319
cryptography is dead because anomalous

1599
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,319
curves have been broken in polynomial

1600
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,599
time

1601
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:42,640
um

1602
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,240
second statement

1603
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,640
um so md5 like

1604
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,119
you don't even need to understand the

1605
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,079
attackers md5 you can simply download

1606
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,359
a ready-to-use library and

1607
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,559
start creating collisions in like less

1608
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,319
than half a minute on one standard pc

1609
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:07,040
uh so md5 is utterly broken this means

1610
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,880
hash functions

1611
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,200
are broken we cannot use hash function

1612
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,720
for functions anymore

1613
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,520
because md5 is broken and show one is

1614
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,480
going along the same lines probably this

1615
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,359
will take a few more minutes but um it's

1616
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,720
not that hard to to do the the same

1617
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,000
thing so

1618
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,520
hash functions are broken why are you or

1619
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,920
why are we wasting time using elliptic

1620
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,319
curves and hash functions

1621
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:39,200
rsa as well discuss about um

1622
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,000
safe primes and unsafe primary

1623
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,520
multi-prime rsa things like this so rsa

1624
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,480
is dead as well so

1625
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,079
in face of these

1626
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,240
actual scenarios and hypothetical

1627
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,280
statements cc is broken rsa is broken

1628
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,760
hash functions are all broken

1629
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,200
um

1630
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:03,040
so psych was the target for powerful

1631
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,040
attack recently

1632
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,520
so the statement is isogeny based

1633
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,440
cryptography is broken it's all dead why

1634
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,480
would we want to invest time

1635
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,359
doing this like why would we want to

1636
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,799
uh propose

1637
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:22,640
um signatures based on misogynies given

1638
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,240
that we have these

1639
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,280
powerful results there's recent results

1640
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,240
um is isogenic base crypto dead

1641
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,880
look thanks for

1642
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,760
thanks for playing devil's advocate um

1643
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,280
no of course there's rgb's cryptography

1644
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,400
is not that um

1645
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,559
we are coming to a point where there is

1646
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,880
certain agreement that as far as we can

1647
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,520
see now these techniques

1648
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,760
specifically apply to psych to

1649
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,400
a few systems that are similar to psych

1650
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,079
um they shouldn't generalize to all of

1651
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:57,839
those objects in this cryptography

1652
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,599
if you generalize too much

1653
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:02,640
at some point you also break ecc because

1654
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,839
there are

1655
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,440
links between ecc and subject-based

1656
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,880
cryptography

1657
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,559
so we don't expect everything to be

1658
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,319
broken um but of course this is the kind

1659
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,640
of situation where only time will tell

1660
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,920
um

1661
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,359
and

1662
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:16,160
yeah

1663
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,079
right now we're

1664
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:19,839
not in a good spot with exogenous guitar

1665
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:21,680
if you're gonna go through some time of

1666
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,400
doubts and

1667
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,640
loss of confidence but uh yeah we will

1668
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,359
need more time to gain confidence um

1669
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,559
still the systems that are still alive

1670
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:34,240
that still work is the majority of

1671
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,920
estrogen-based photography because in

1672
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,520
all honesty

1673
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,880
very little as audition-based

1674
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,799
cryptography was business psych most of

1675
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:43,440
the reason for work was done on seaside

1676
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,000
on things based on the the during

1677
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,200
correspondence such as ski sign and add

1678
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,520
new families of signature schemes

1679
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,880
so

1680
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,039
those are still very promising schemes

1681
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,440
that are worth investigating so yeah we

1682
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,599
should absolutely not stop investigating

1683
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,599
those

1684
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:04,480
i do feel for

1685
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,680
those young researchers whose phd plans

1686
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,400
have been completely derailed by um by

1687
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,680
the new attacks

1688
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,039
and i'm sure

1689
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,280
there are species out there

1690
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,119
i'm not even aware of that are in this

1691
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,240
situation

1692
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,319
um suppose this is the risk of doing

1693
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:23,760
cryptography and um

1694
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,000
as a community maybe we should even

1695
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,559
think of how we can

1696
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,200
help people who are in this situation um

1697
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,039
confident there

1698
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:35,119
everyone will find a way out

1699
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:37,039
um i guess the most effective ones are

1700
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:38,240
those who are doing side channel

1701
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,400
analysis and hardware development for

1702
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,400
psych because now we are

1703
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,920
not anymore in a state where you can

1704
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,000
think about such kind of protections for

1705
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,240
izogenes because we are quite far from

1706
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,160
standardization

1707
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,039
but no definitely there is uh hydrogen

1708
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:54,640
based scrutiny is still a very promising

1709
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,280
field it still requires research and we

1710
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,000
shouldn't stop doing

1711
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:05,920
research you want to comment to that

1712
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,000
so um

1713
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,079
do you think like

1714
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,960
the nsa already knew about these attacks

1715
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,280
not only against psych but against

1716
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,599
rainbow for instance like rainbow was a

1717
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:18,559
a

1718
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:20,799
finalist until the beginning of this

1719
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:21,599
year

1720
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,880
so do you

1721
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,599
feel that the nsa knew about this

1722
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,039
already

1723
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,680
or is is this

1724
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,760
such an unexpected development

1725
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,720
especially in the case of this uh attack

1726
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,799
a brilliant attack uh against psych

1727
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:41,200
do you think the the nsa

1728
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,160
uh

1729
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,280
was unlikely to to to to know this

1730
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,880
despite their

1731
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,880
uh their knowledge of the subject

1732
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,880
please look at go ahead

1733
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,599
yeah um that's that's a good question of

1734
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,680
course no one has the answer except

1735
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,880
those who do

1736
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,640
um nsa or other agencies um as far as

1737
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,319
psych is concerned psych is very much

1738
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:09,119
related to elitica cryptography um any

1739
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:11,520
agency that

1740
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,520
deserves this name has lots of people

1741
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,200
who have lots of expertise on analytical

1742
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,880
cryptography and a billion rights in

1743
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,359
general the ideas of the attack do not

1744
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:22,319
come out of nowhere so there is a chance

1745
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,480
that

1746
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,200
some people somewhere nsa maybe or some

1747
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,799
other agency

1748
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:29,599
had

1749
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,359
kind of similar ideas and already knew

1750
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:32,640
of the attack

1751
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,160
we may know

1752
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,039
some 20 years in the future who knows um

1753
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,440
i guess the most important question is

1754
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,520
are we as a community in the public

1755
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,079
doing enough cryptographic analytic

1756
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:45,359
research

1757
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,119
i would like to point out that this

1758
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:48,480
attack

1759
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,200
i spoke just uh two days ago with the

1760
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,039
authors of the attacks

1761
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,520
and it did not come out from a

1762
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,000
purposeful effort for uh accurate

1763
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,799
analyzing sidh it came out of a

1764
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:02,720
constructive project where they can

1765
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,359
we're trying to construct some

1766
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,200
higher dimensional generalizations of

1767
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,480
sidh and trying to get new primitives

1768
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,079
because that's the only way you can get

1769
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,480
funding in cryptography is by publishing

1770
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,160
and it's very difficult to publish with

1771
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,599
analysis it's much easier to publish

1772
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:19,760
construction so in a way was almost an

1773
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,280
accidental break

1774
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,319
that came out of trying to do what

1775
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:27,119
you can in academia be paid to do

1776
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,000
um

1777
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,240
so this is a question that should we be

1778
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,119
asking ourselves uh are we in the public

1779
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,599
well equipped to do crypto analysis and

1780
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,960
to be honest it's a difficult question

1781
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,079
and i don't have the answer

1782
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,880
okay so we're

1783
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,799
most out of time here but

1784
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:45,680
um

1785
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,640
so just for the record as a disclaimer

1786
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,520
i'm

1787
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,559
one of the causes of bike and i have not

1788
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,760
taken any bribe from any agency

1789
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,440
whatsoever

1790
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,400
so have you

1791
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:03,359
so just for the records

1792
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,480
uh look at did you take any bribe from

1793
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,079
the nsa or

1794
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,559
or something i'm happy to give you my

1795
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,079
bank account

1796
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:16,559
number if you want to transfer something

1797
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,440
okay no i wasn't right

1798
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,200
uh would anybody

1799
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,319
ask any question

1800
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,920
remote audience as well

1801
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,920
okay so let's thank our panelists for

1802
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,079
this first session thank you for

1803
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,079
attending

1804
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:50,839
okay
