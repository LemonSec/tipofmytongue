1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,520
maria who will be speaking about the

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,199
generalized montgomery coordinate a new

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,040
computational tool for isogeny-based

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,120
cryptography

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,160
thank you for introducing me

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,400
okay first i explain

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,280
the main results of our study

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,440
first we propose a new concept that

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,680
generates mongodb konate that unifies

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,600
some special coordinates of fd curve

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,320
used for isogen based cryptography

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,279
for example uh exco nato mongolian cub

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,000
an x coordinate of mongolian minus cub w

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,719
coinage of elvis cup every coin and half

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,600
cup

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,760
and omega coordinate or twisted jacobi

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,760
intersection cups

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,239
and next we constructed general

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,719
quantitative formula formulas using the

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,200
general memory coordinate

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,160
and

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,559
finally as application we construct new

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,079
formulas and coordinates

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,120
okay here contents and why first i

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,800
introduced one coding type formulas

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,039
first i define the ft curve

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,280
we call a pair of smooth algebraic curve

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,320
e of genus one and it's point o oe and

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,680
fd curve

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,400
and here are some examples of fd cards

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,479
a montgomery cub is a cult defined by

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,520
this equation and oe equals zero one

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,640
zero

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,960
and this is among the minus curve

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,640
and it was called this curve different

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,400
by this equation

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,720
and only is equal to zero one and half

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,000
curve is the difference with this

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,040
equation

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,079
and always as zero

41
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,200
and uh an important property of epic

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,000
card is uh etikov has a commutative

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,159
group structure and its identity point

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,159
is oem and this image represent uh

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,399
this group operation or the uh case of

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,680
mongolia

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,240
and this point p and q and we can set

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,439
the point this point as p plus q

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,960
and then

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,759
set this point as a doubling p and this

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,840
operation becomes a commutative group

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,840
operation

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,640
and next i i define as sargonii

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,320
and i saw generator subject to morphism

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,840
between fd cars that is of group

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
morphism and this is astogeny and uh

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,520
this is a very important concept for

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,400
isogen physical cryptography

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,599
and

60
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,920
in isogen-based cryptography

61
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,440
there is a very important formula for

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,840
computing isogenes

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,319
there is formula is the formulas uh

64
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,000
it's computed from the subgroup g of e

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120
and it outputs an empty curve e over g

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,959
and an i sergey

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,080
phi from e to e or g with this kernel

68
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
equals to g

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,560
and in isogen-based cryptography we use

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
these formulas and compute london many

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,200
exogenous

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,360
and here so important for computations

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,840
for isogen-based cryptography

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,800
and first one is addition

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,640
and second one is

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,840
doubling

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,480
and we can use we can construct a scalar

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,840
multiplication by using these two

79
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,080
formulas and third one is a complete for

80
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,280
image points

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
and last one is the complete4 for the

82
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,360
wing curve e over g

83
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,440
so uh these last two one is a very

84
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
fullness

85
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,080
and any isogen based graph system use

86
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,720
these four computations so uh it is

87
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
important task to

88
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,720
make these computation efficiently

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,159
and in isagen-based cryptography we use

90
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,280
one cornea type formulas

91
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,959
and there are some one corner type

92
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,599
formulas are known the most basic one is

93
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,000
a formula using x-coordinate of

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,599
monomials

95
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,159
and this is

96
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,959
and this is called and the first uh

97
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,120
formula is the suit addition

98
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,560
by using this uh formula uh equation we

99
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,439
can compute the x coordinate of p plus q

100
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,920
from uh x coordinate of p and x

101
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,640
coordinate q and x coordinate of p minus

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,239
q

103
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,720
and second one is the sub doubling

104
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,120
and we can compute the x coordinate of

105
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,000
the p from x coordinate p

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,159
and alpha alpha is a

107
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,519
coefficient of

108
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,238
and we call this question one recursion

109
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,079
and by using these two formulas we can

110
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,759
compute the scalar

111
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,560
multiplication

112
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,040
and next this is a

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,160
formula for computing isogenes

114
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,639
and the first one is a form s4 image

115
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,560
point and we can compute the

116
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,639
x-coordinate of phi p

117
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,680
from the

118
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,440
exponent p and x-coordinate of points in

119
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,520
the

120
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:41,840
and kernel

121
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,199
second one is a formula for domain card

122
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,639
the uh the target of this formula is the

123
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,240
boundary coefficient of e over g

124
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,040
and we can compute uh the moment

125
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,280
coefficient of a or g from the amount of

126
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
equation of e

127
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,840
and

128
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,759
x coordinates of points in the kernels

129
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,520
so we can compute

130
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,600
all four formulas by using x coordinate

131
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,080
of monomial curves

132
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,000
and second basic one is a w coordinate

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,560
of edwards called and edward's curve is

134
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,759
this

135
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,720
curve

136
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,960
and the double coordinate is defined by

137
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,680
d

138
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,160
x squared y squared here it is a

139
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,759
quotient of edwards call and we call

140
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,960
this quotient elves coefficient

141
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,440
and similarly uh

142
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,759
by using uh the recognition we can

143
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,759
compute the solution so we can compute

144
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,560
every coordinate of p plus q from a w

145
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,039
coordinate of p and w coordinate of q

146
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,280
and double cognate to p minus q

147
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,759
and similarly we can compute uh the

148
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,880
recording determine p from the root pe

149
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,280
and algorithm coefficient d

150
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,080
and here also the uh formulas for uh

151
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,560
computing isogenetics

152
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,479
then we can compute uh

153
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,479
w coordinate of yp from the wp and

154
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,520
uh

155
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,919
the double coordinate of uh points in

156
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,199
the kernels

157
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,000
and we we can also compute the uh

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,400
formula column in curve and the target

159
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,319
of this formula is uh

160
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,680
edwards coefficient of a or g

161
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,479
so uh you may know uh these two uh

162
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,880
cases are very they these have the very

163
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,960
similar formulas

164
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
the last one uh the performance for

165
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,759
clean cut is a totally different but

166
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,199
addition the suit that ring and image

167
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,400
points are

168
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,880
looks very similar

169
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,960
and this is not only for the mongrel

170
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,319
cards and foreign it also uh occurs for

171
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,360
the

172
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,960
w coordinates of the house card

173
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,599
and i didn't write it but uh

174
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,759
omega coined it uh twisted the aqua

175
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,720
intersection cups also similar coins

176
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,599
uh so there is one question i lies uh is

177
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,680
there any way to unify these formulas

178
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
and in classical uh

179
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,280
there's a famous theory that's a

180
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,199
recumbent line this is a

181
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,440
sorry for one conan type formula

182
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,240
and in this theory uh by using uh data

183
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,080
functions we can construct some one

184
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
coordinate type formula

185
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,160
and by using this theory uh for the

186
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,240
scalar multiplication we can construct

187
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,720
explicit formulas so by using data

188
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,440
functions we can unify the two of four

189
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,880
formulas

190
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,840
uh in the previous right

191
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,240
and for isogen computation uh there are

192
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
some studies

193
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,919
and there's some algorithm but these

194
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,840
algorithms are a little bit complicated

195
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,879
and these algorithms are target for not

196
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,720
optical these are targets turret in uh

197
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,000
uh

198
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
three uh available varieties

199
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,639
of io genius

200
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,160
so uh

201
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,080
it it seems hard to adapt uh use

202
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,520
unifying

203
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,319
the

204
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,919
all four formulas

205
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,000
so we think uh

206
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,039
we need another approach to unify

207
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,840
these four formulas

208
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,759
we are going to the generous memory

209
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,840
coordinate

210
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,919
uh before defining one recognite uh i i

211
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,360
explained about the diversion of the

212
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,639
function

213
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,720
for function f4 we call c we go the

214
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,800
following divisor a device of a function

215
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,440
then here is a very important

216
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,279
property for different function for

217
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,120
function e and g

218
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,760
if these devices are equals

219
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,519
then

220
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,958
there's a constant value c and f equals

221
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,079
c times g

222
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,200
and now uh we have the

223
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,720
definition of generals among memory

224
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,160
connect

225
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,279
for

226
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,000
e and its subgroup g and the point are

227
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,839
in this set

228
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,440
and define the function hd also as uh

229
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,800
satisfying this uh property

230
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,399
and we call this function a general's

231
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,519
mongolia coordinate of e

232
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,279
next i explain

233
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,760
some important properties of this

234
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,160
function

235
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,600
first

236
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,839
these 7

237
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,680
holds if we compute the h g r 0

238
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,519
e plus r 0

239
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,160
it is equal to the g over

240
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,360
h g other p for a

241
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,600
longer constant c

242
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,880
we can prove this very easily

243
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,760
by uh considering the divisor of the

244
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,480
left hand side of this equation and

245
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,399
consider the light the divisor of the

246
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,880
right hand of this equation and we know

247
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,680
that these uh devices are same

248
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,920
so there is a constant value c uh

249
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,040
satisfying this equation

250
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,680
then by using this sum we can define the

251
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,079
normalized transmog recognition

252
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,720
if the constant values equals one we

253
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,640
call this general coordinate and

254
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,160
homogeneous monomial coordinate

255
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,360
then here are some examples of normal

256
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,760
genes among recognition

257
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,720
for among recurves x coordinate is a

258
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,959
normal generally coordinate

259
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,399
0 equals 0 the set of 0 and g is the

260
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,320
trivial group

261
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,720
and for mongolian minus curve no margin

262
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,959
mongrel kuni is a

263
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,839
the square root minus one x is a normal

264
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,160
origin smaller coordinate

265
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,959
and

266
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,000
what it was called uh the inverse of its

267
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,640
mean the one over w

268
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,200
it's the numerator and small recognition

269
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,839
are there is a point at infinity and g

270
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,320
is a cyclic group of all the four

271
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,800
and four half card adobe coin8 is the

272
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,880
normal general coordinate

273
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,680
and r0 is a set of a point at infinity

274
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,279
and g is

275
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,360
the trivial group

276
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,000
so uh

277
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,120
[Music]

278
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,440
later i explained the uh generalized

279
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,920
formula from the uh gentlemanly chronic

280
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,720
so this is the reason why these cognate

281
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,320
have the similar one coordinator

282
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,839
formulas

283
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,360
it is because they are corresponding to

284
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,959
the numerators memory coordinate

285
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,519
then next i explained another aspect of

286
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,839
the normalization recognite

287
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,880
a normal generator coordinate h igr cell

288
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,200
can be represented by the composition of

289
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,839
x coordinate of mongolia called e over g

290
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,480
and an isogeny by e to e over g

291
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,800
okay and these are the some properties

292
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,640
of adjacence

293
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,560
and next i explain the uh general

294
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,600
formulas

295
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,640
of the general monogamy coordinate

296
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,920
and the first formula is the

297
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,320
pseudo-addition and for any inverse

298
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,959
genome we call it it holds that this

299
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,399
equation

300
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,920
and and it is also kind of easy uh

301
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,720
proved

302
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,120
by the comparing the the red file

303
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,160
divisor and the right size of divisor

304
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,200
and these devices are equals so uh there

305
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,720
is a uh

306
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,959
known constant value c and by

307
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,160
substituting some good points to e b and

308
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,639
q and we find their constant value is

309
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,200
equal one

310
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,880
and next uh

311
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,079
there's a

312
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,560
formula for the doubling

313
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,839
and here are i you know the new concept

314
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,519
alpha h

315
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,000
g l0 and this is the constant value i

316
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,320
usually computed from the general

317
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,120
coordinate hdr0

318
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,240
and we call this alpha ah general memory

319
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,760
coefficient

320
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,200
so uh also uh subducting also hold for

321
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,959
any normal genes among read coordinate

322
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,600
and third one the formulas for image

323
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,279
point

324
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,720
and we uh

325
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,000
pour on isogeny by satisfying the

326
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,320
uh this property

327
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,160
and it and then there is a normal

328
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,240
smaller generator coordinate h5g file 0

329
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,240
and it holds that this equation and this

330
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,160
is the formula for image point

331
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,480
then here is the

332
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,040
last formula and formulas for computing

333
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,800
column curves

334
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,680
the target of this formula is a

335
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,440
generally generalized monomial

336
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,800
coefficient of h by g and pi i zero

337
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,040
and we can compute easily compute this

338
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,440
coefficient because this is either

339
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
computed by the

340
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,079
general mongol coordinate h phi g fire

341
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,839
zero

342
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,320
so uh we can uh construct the formulas

343
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
focus on emc curve and actually uh this

344
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,240
formula can be represented as a lesson

345
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,639
function of alpha and of hp earp is a

346
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,199
point in the columns

347
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,920
but this is one problem

348
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,800
this formula is not a function of p

349
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,040
so we cannot use in the discussion of

350
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,279
divisor and

351
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,720
these formulas are not unique

352
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,040
in fact the formula for

353
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,480
x-coordinate among recall and the

354
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,279
formulas on the double recognition cards

355
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,199
are totally different

356
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,519
so there is another question like

357
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,600
how do we constant construct the other

358
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,279
formulas

359
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,680
the key is a division polynomial

360
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,399
and here's one proportion and n is a

361
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,560
possible number and then the polynomial

362
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,800
of psi p and phi p

363
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,560
with the integer coefficient

364
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
and satisfying these

365
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,480
three properties

366
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,800
and we call the polynomial uh

367
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,560
sine m as the uh

368
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,240
ms division polynomial of generous

369
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,480
montgomery coordinate

370
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,279
and by defining this uh

371
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,720
concept we have the next seven

372
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,480
and if there is a two different formula

373
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
for computing cooling cards the

374
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
difference of these formula uh can be

375
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,880
represented by the

376
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,000
psi l

377
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,279
times some rational function

378
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,639
so uh we can theoretically construct any

379
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,040
formulas by using this 7.

380
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,480
okay and then finally i explain the

381
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,199
application

382
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,440
uh first application at

383
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
the construct new formulas

384
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,279
uh the from the theory of generalizable

385
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,519
coordinates are formulas of x coordinate

386
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,680
memory cards and the dozen double coins

387
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,120
edwards called are two three same

388
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,519
and so we can uh transplant an efficient

389
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,000
formula as fd cards

390
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,759
to uh

391
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,560
uh tractable among recall and this is a

392
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
new formula so among recurve

393
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,000
the formulas for computing uh following

394
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,079
cup

395
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,560
and here's the expensive result

396
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,880
and we use the svc library

397
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,839
and

398
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,959
the

399
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,759
the in image of the horizontal is a

400
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,839
degree of

401
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,320
isogeny and vertically the layer of the

402
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
previous formula the cost of previous

403
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,480
formula and the new hormones

404
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,519
and under this red line is the

405
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,199
part of the

406
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,440
our new formulas are more efficient than

407
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,360
the previous one

408
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,600
so uh the

409
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,800
at most add about the five percent

410
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,800
more efficient than the previous one

411
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,759
and there's a final application

412
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,920
we construct a new coordinate among my

413
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,120
mars curve and it is a generalized

414
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,519
boundary coordinate

415
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,120
and by using uh this coinage we can

416
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,920
use efficient formulas for the

417
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,759
generation formulas of genetic molecular

418
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,800
kinade

419
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,600
so uh some item-based schemes using

420
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,240
montgomery mine's carb for example csof

421
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,959
are

422
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,240
expected more efficient

423
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,559
okay my presentation is over thank you

424
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,660
for racing

425
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,720
[Applause]

426
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,079
all right thank you for the nice talk

427
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,438
are there questions for the speaker

428
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,839
uh so it it seems like

429
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,799
like a problem with um

430
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,679
like

431
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,080
one coordinate representations is that

432
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,840
you can't distinguish a point and it's

433
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,799
inverse

434
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,799
are there any like it seems like you've

435
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,480
showed that all of those representations

436
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,320
would have that problem right

437
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,640
are there any like one coordinate

438
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,400
representations where

439
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,240
you can distinguish a point from its

440
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,679
inverse

441
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,840
uh sorry oh uh

442
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,240
you mean that is there any

443
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,960
uh one contact formulas that we can the

444
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,520
uh exp experiment

445
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,280
more connect

446
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,400
sorry i i i answer i know i i can't i

447
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,480
didn't catch your question

448
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,960
uh like uh so if you if you're only

449
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,840
taking

450
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,080
the x coordinate on a say on on the

451
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
montgomery curve right you can't

452
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,360
distinguish

453
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,280
now you don't know whether you have like

454
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,200
p or minus p

455
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,440
right so are there any are there any

456
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,480
like

457
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,559
one coordinate representations where you

458
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,600
could do that or

459
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,360
have you proved that is impossible or

460
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,600
like yeah i guess that's my question

461
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,840
your question is is there any other

462
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,440
representation for one corner type

463
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,640
congress

464
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,559
you mean yeah where you don't have that

465
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,720
problem uh

466
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,200
the answer is we don't know but

467
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,840
this is one of the future work uh for is

468
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,720
there that research research uh any

469
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,520
other uh representation for one contact

470
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,080
formulas okay

471
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,240
thank you

472
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,840
right do we have some other questions

473
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,160
okay let me ask if there's any questions

474
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,960
coming from zoom

475
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,760
so i have one question actually um can

476
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,960
you go to the slide with the graph

477
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,679
yeah i'm curious um

478
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,000
uh i mean it seems like there's a sort

479
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,799
of

480
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,960
infinite search space of possible

481
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,320
possible formulas that you're like you

482
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,600
start with one formula and you can

483
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,320
modify it right so how did you how did

484
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,240
you search through this space

485
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,480
uh okay and uh i searched by that this

486
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,000
is a previous my work and then it is

487
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,160
already known that using edward's car we

488
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,880
can compute uh efficiently but edward's

489
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,320
car is not so tractable so

490
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,039
but by using this theorem we can use the

491
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,200
adwords curve and the formulas over the

492
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,080
curve

493
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,320
to that of the monomial cup because

494
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,000
these formulas are

495
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,880
same

496
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,840
so uh

497
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,240
the so the how do we search for the more

498
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,919
efficient one is the

499
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,880
i sorry i don't know but uh how to

500
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,120
refine this formula is that

501
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,919
the answer is uh it is already known for

502
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,240
the editable that's everywhere it was

503
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,440
called

504
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,120
but then on the on the next slide where

505
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,280
you have the graph how did you find do

506
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,720
you know that those blue points are like

507
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,880
the best that you can do

508
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,360
uh this is uh

509
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,480
this is a parameter for the hivc library

510
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,400
and we can check this many primes at

511
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,200
the many degree primes and uh

512
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,000
and

513
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
we can compute the cost by using sfvc

514
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,910
library so

515
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,240
[Music]
