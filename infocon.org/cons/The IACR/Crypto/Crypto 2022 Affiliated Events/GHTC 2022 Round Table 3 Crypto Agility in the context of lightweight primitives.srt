1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,400
so hello everyone uh welcome to the

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,599
third round table of this Workshop uh

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,820
today we are going to discuss uh the

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,400
fascinating uh crypto agility in the

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,320
context of lightweight Primitives this

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,600
like what a lightweight uh discipline of

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,160
cryptography

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,080
um that is so important and that uh

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,080
we are running also a nice contest at

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,980
the moment

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,560
on these Primitives our distinguished

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,300
panelists are Guido Bertoni from

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,000
security pattern Italy uh John diamond

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,920
from University the Netherlands or

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,800

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,879
Milton's sonness to run from nist uh all

17
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,660
are for uh speakers uh panelists are

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,260
connectedly connected remotely so we are

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,440
going to to work like that in this round

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,940
table

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,699
um and I would like to start uh asking

22
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,920
our panelists to introduce themselves

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,860
before that I want to remind you that

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,680
questions are very welcome so if you

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,439
have any questions please uh post them

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,119
either online or here in the auditorium

27
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,400
so let's start with our panelists and so

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,380
I will ask uh Guido could you please

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,740
introduce yourself

30
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,740
hello everybody nice to be here today

31
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,500
even yesterday so my name is Guido

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,460
Bertoni I took an engineering degree in

33
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,380
the previous Millennium from Polytechnic

34
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,700
of the Milano and then a PhD after a PhD

35
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,180
I worked for uh 14 years in St Mac

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,320
Electronics I was in charge of an r d

37
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,020
teamer that was

38
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,880
developing cryptographic course so most

39
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,340
of my work and research was on the

40
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,140
implementation of a cryptographic

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,860
algorithms and all the aspects of as a

42
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,200
channel for the protection

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,020
and uh five years ago I started my own

44
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,959
company the security pattern and we work

45
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,780
in the field of cyber security for

46
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,440
embedded device and iot

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,980
thank you thank you Guido we are going

48
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,560
in in alphabetical order by by last name

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,900
so please join could you please uh

50
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,739
introduce yourself

51
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,640
[Music]

52
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,738
in the 90s so that's previous century

53
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,959
um and then after my PhD I went to work

54
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,360
for industry for a very long time until

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,459
2000

56
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,019
15 where I got an offer to work at hot

57
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,420
dog as a professor and that was in the

58
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,760
beginning half time and now it's full

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,379
time

60
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,319
so yeah I worked with Guido on the shot

61
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,560
three and I work with Vincent on

62
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,640
AES so uh yeah I don't know what's that

63
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,080
else to say

64
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,379
so I made Hugo made his move

65
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,140
from industry to his own company I made

66
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,800
a move from industry to Academia you

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,000
would say

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,519
okay thank you very much uh done for

69
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,680
being here and also Guido uh we are very

70
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,260
pleased that you're here um or could you

71
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,060
please uh go ahead and introduce

72
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,299
yourself

73
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,220
yes hello my name is I hope you can hear

74
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,080
me better than Johan you're on your

75
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,019
voice level it was a bit on the low side

76
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,319
to fix it later I did everybody are

77
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,819
discussing when they started studying so

78
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,200
I started in the previous Millennium

79
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,959
which was also the previous Century

80
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,299
um and then they moved on to PhD during

81
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,540
this century and this Millennium

82
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,299
graduated from 2006 from the Techno then

83
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,580
they moved to Cosmic I was in Kazakh for

84
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,019
a year and a half then I called normal

85
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,780
Superior and then they also invites an

86
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,220
Institute now I'm a faculty at the

87
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,599
computer science department at the

88
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,060
University of Haifa

89
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,480
I've been involved I I joined crypto

90
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,260
just

91
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,379
the day or a few days before the end of

92
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,079
the AES submission deadline so I saw

93
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,358
from the sidelines how AES process looks

94
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,820
like also my first presentation was in

95
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,520
as2 in Rome which was a fun experience

96
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,960
given the fact that once I started

97
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,940
speaking everybody stopped listening and

98
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,759
looked at their papers so it was very

99
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,780
a good experience as a young scientist

100
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,340
I was also involved during the Messi

101
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,340
competition as part of my research and

102
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,400
then I participated in chatri not very

103
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,020
successfully and also in the lightweight

104
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,020
crypto Constitution and

105
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,180
we'll see how that goes

106
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,699
okay thank you thank you all for being

107
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,000
here in uh Melton Place uh could you go

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,100
ahead and introduce yourself sure sure

109
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,800
thanks to the organizers first for for

110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,479
the invitation yes my name is

111
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,520
um I've been working at nest for the

112
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,320
last 13 years

113
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,539
um right now I'm cool leading the Miss

114
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:11,400
livemaid cryptography standardization

115
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,940
process but uh before that I was uh

116
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,460
involved with the shot 3 competition and

117
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,680
also password hashing competition that's

118
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,620
not part of this but and also with other

119
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,259
standards that are based on symmetric

120
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,360
keys and also the random number

121
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,780
generation standards and lists

122
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,600
thank you very much

123
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,780
welcome here uh to this panel okay so

124
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,440
let me start with this question for um

125
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,000
for every one of you

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,100
um I would like to to ask you in your

127
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,840
opinion what is lightweight crypto

128
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,820
agility and why does it seem to be a

129
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,259
nightmare for the industry

130
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,800
to answer maybe uh we can start with

131
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,340
Joan

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,280
um can you hear me well now because I

133
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,020
had a problem with my microphone yes

134
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,600
yeah the volume was too low

135
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,300
yeah so lightweight you can discuss what

136
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,919
it is

137
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,819
um I think um it's not so clear but

138
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:15,479
um

139
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,600
I kind of decided that lightweight for

140
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,000
me is like low energy consumption per

141
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,139
bit

142
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,840
when you do encryption or authentication

143
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,580
or authenticator encryption that's like

144
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,039
kind of I think that's a long-term

145
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,900
Criterion

146
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,380
I think it's always relevant because for

147
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,120
battery power but for instance if you

148
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,580
have a high bandwidth uh

149
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,560
connection that I've had really high

150
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,940
bandwidth then it's the

151
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,819
um heating of the chip right so the more

152
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,979
energy you consume the more the chippy

153
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,380
so I think that's for me lightweight

154
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,940
that's really the ultimate lightweight

155
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,360
Criterion to energy

156
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,880
per bits encrypted but of course that's

157
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,280
a lot of subtleties you can say for long

158
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,199
messages or short messages and so on so

159
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,199
it's not so simple but that's for me uh

160
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,139
the criteria

161
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:12,539
thank you okay uh what would be your

162
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:16,319
opinion or about this topic or what is

163
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,599
like so I think sorry no no okay please

164
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,360
so the the

165
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,759
I I somewhat agree and disagree with

166
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,740
Johan because the question what like

167
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,900
what constitutes lightweight I think it

168
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,180
depends on what your uh

169
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,580
what's your application in mind I guess

170
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,199
some people would say oh it's gate area

171
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,000
some people will say it's power

172
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
consumption uh but but something to to

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,740
put in context I mean usually the

174
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,479
broadcast energy is way higher than the

175
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,940
crypto energy so it's it's usually less

176
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,039
of an issue but some people would argue

177
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,900
it's latency some people will argue

178
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,479
throughput so it's a bit hard to say oh

179
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,940
here is one metric which which I like

180
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,720
and this one I want to to optimize but

181
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,699
but I think at the end if we discuss

182
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,879
lightweight for Hardware design and

183
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,039
independent of what is your optimization

184
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,160
Target it's in hardware and then it's

185
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,199
not like you can just you ask the

186
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,660
question was about agility in these

187
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,580
environment and we know that changing

188
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,479
Hardware is hard I mean this is not like

189
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,919
changing software

190
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,740
um so so this is why the problem arises

191
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,139
I think

192
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,660
so you see it quite Associated to

193
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,419
Hardware design uh or in your opinion I

194
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,000
I think it's it's a huge factor I mean

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,820
also software agility is not as simple

196
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,559
as we like to think of that you know

197
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,719
people are still using md5 people are

198
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,240
still using DS but but look for example

199
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,459
at the banking industry

200
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,380
they have been discussing the transition

201
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,360
from triple desk to AES from the last

202
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,360
God knows how many years they still

203
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,800
haven't done the switch because they

204
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,260
have huge pile of Hardware running

205
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,880
around the world and you have to update

206
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,519
all the hardware everywhere and you can

207
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,959
say that in banking they don't have

208
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,700
money and they already don't care about

209
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,940
security

210
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,640
so there is a problem there and I think

211
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,680
that if we discuss you know iot devices

212
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,640
or smart home devices first of all many

213
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,500
times the the company doesn't even have

214
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,540
the proficiency you just buy some SDK

215
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,480
from some you know Philips or Samsung or

216
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,100
something like that sorry it's not

217
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,680
logarithms it's an XP right you call it

218
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,320
an XP and it's a iot devices but you buy

219
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,480
something from nxp or from Samsung

220
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,640
recent company and you know you have no

221
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,680
idea what's going on and we see this for

222
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,240
example if you look at our neighbors AT

223
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,120
scada Systems you know all scada systems

224
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,519
which are were designed in the 80s they

225
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,040
are still running around

226
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,959
your car is protected by security

227
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,000
protocols from the 80s

228
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,440
how happy are you now right

229
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,279
yes okay thank you very much Malcolm do

230
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,140
you have uh something to say about this

231
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,200
yeah so I think crypto agility in

232
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,500
lightweight crypto is not very different

233
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,480
from conventional crypto we still have

234
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,700
the same problems in conventional crypto

235
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,140
as well

236
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,959
um I agree that work here the targets

237
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,540
mostly is on Hardware implementation so

238
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,360
it makes it a lot harder to change and

239
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,180
the devices are a lot you know we have

240
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,880
small devices and there are the number

241
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,940
is huge compared to Conventional crypto

242
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,240
that makes the problems like uh

243
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,360
harder maybe yeah but I agree with

244
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,660
Lauren Johan's comments

245
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,019
okay thank you uh Milton uh we though

246
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,360
what about your opinion you as an uh

247
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,760
Hardware designer expert what's your

248
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,480
name yes yes yeah I think that that uh

249
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,459
the big problem is that changing is a

250
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:57,600
cost so just if uh you you want to build

251
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,519
something you would like to minimize the

252
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,480
cost and if you have to start designing

253
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,720
a device and thinking that

254
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,600
the hardware part so the cryptographic

255
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,640
heart the cryptographic algorithm should

256
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,800
change then you have to forecast in

257
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,300
advance and maybe put two or three

258
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,120
different algorithms inside which is a

259
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,000
quite a nightmare and then let's say you

260
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,240
try to minimize this cost and uh so as

261
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,420
or was saying we still have a very good

262
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,320
example of the md5 and xia1 so that even

263
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,839
if it was really

264
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,360
badly broken

265
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,640
it took a very long time to get rid of

266
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,940
these of these algorithms and sometimes

267
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,459
it's not only changing the r plus so all

268
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,200
the process of changing an algorithm

269
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,399
requires some time requires testing and

270
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,620
be extremely sure that when you change

271
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,360
that algorithm everything will work

272
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,360
perfectly and so it's like just a

273
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,519
building block that you put at the

274
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,800
basement of a building and once you have

275
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,079
stuck many things on top of it nobody

276
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,519
wants to go in the basement and

277
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,680
substitute that block because there is

278
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,540
that everything will collapse is very

279
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,120
high so this is I think the the industry

280
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,240
drama about the agility so that it's a

281
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,940
very nice word but especially in the

282
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,980
field of Hardware you want to minimize

283
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,660
the cost and you would like to have only

284
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,639
one algorithm and

285
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,300
hopefully that that's it right

286
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,480
um and let me ask you this question uh

287
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,880
there are configurability property of

288
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,820
fpgas can help for getting the agility

289
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,680
in your experience in the industry

290
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,579
yes and no uh so so if uh as also R was

291
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,880
saying if I think at lightweight uh the

292
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,079
first thing that I think is really

293
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,060
hardware and and really low cost

294
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,540
hardware and uh let's say if you take

295
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,899
low end devices uh like a small sensors

296
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,820
or FID tags smart cards so they they

297
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,700
don't embed the fpgas because fpga is a

298
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,160
higher cost in a hardware because they

299
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,700
reconfigurable species really require a

300
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,100
larger silicon area because you have to

301
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,720
put more resources so fpgs are used

302
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,040
in a nature environment if you compare

303
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,380
to the use of microcontroller

304
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,720
microprocessor and so on so they are

305
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,519
really really cool device you can do a

306
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,240
lot of things but this is not what you

307
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,160
find in your Smartwatch in your

308
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,920
smartphone and so on because once you

309
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,079
start to have very large volumes if you

310
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,000
do a dedicated Hardware then the cost

311
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,920
with with the scale of the volume

312
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,279
becomes a smaller compared to an fpga

313
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,680
right and probably you will be giving up

314
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,779
the lightweight property right because

315
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,139
fpgas are kind of heavy maybe yeah yeah

316
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,260
okay okay thank you very much to all of

317
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,420
you so um I have another question you

318
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,699
know for me it's kind of striking uh

319
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:09,000
considering the the two round tables the

320
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,420
two previous round tables uh i s we saw

321
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,899
that um the post Quantum schemes in the

322
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,440
post Quantum uh competition are backed

323
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,440
up by the industry like Google IBM

324
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,720
Microsoft research Etc

325
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,060
um I have this impression that in in the

326
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,920
next contest in the this competition for

327
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,699
lightweight crypto uh is mostly an

328
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:36,120
academic effort am I with a good uh

329
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,100
impression could you please comment on

330
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,820
this maybe we could start with Melton

331
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,620
yeah so

332
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,320
um true and false so I I kind of agree

333
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,360
that there is a lot of backup uh you

334
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,860
know support from the crypto Community

335
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,980
especially since the

336
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,380
um even the you know right after the

337
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,019
announcement of design away yes people

338
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,079
started to people kept on designing New

339
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,380
Black ciphers new stream ciphers and uh

340
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,480
there was always this challenge can we

341
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,079
make it more efficient and and also we

342
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,160
had some new features that the the

343
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,279
industry I wanted like maybe we want

344
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,199
something nice misused we want something

345
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,779
related key security maybe we want

346
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,959
hashing and aead together like combined

347
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,759
functionality oh they industry asked for

348
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,519
okay V1 we have a yes but can we also

349
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,920
have some inherent side channel uh

350
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,560
resistance or

351
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,560
or maybe more suitability for these

352
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,600
constrained environments like that's

353
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,180
where the lightweight crypto uh comes in

354
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,019
uh so to understand so we were of course

355
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,360
following up with the research uh

356
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,279
results because they were more

357
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,639
accessible to us but at the same time in

358
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,980
the beginning though once we started

359
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,300
talking about okay do we need

360
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,220
lightweight crypto we organize two

361
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,180
workshops uh in one in 2015 one in 2016

362
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,699
before we announced this competition

363
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,899
online process and then uh we had

364
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:15,540
companies reaching reaching us to us

365
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,199
saying oh we actually want a thank you

366
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,720
know more efficient algorithms say yes

367
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,300
but does not necessarily fit our

368
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,820
purposes this was more mostly for the

369
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,880
RFID text the implementations that use

370
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,920
RFID text but uh we had some uh

371
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,040
industry comments on Healthcare devices

372
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,579
and also for vehicle Communications but

373
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,380
of course this was like five years ago

374
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,440
and a lot of changed in the field since

375
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,120
then

376
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,940
um yeah I agree that most of the drive

377
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,820
was from the research community that we

378
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,100
could do better and there are solutions

379
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,120
and especially for right after the

380
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,920
announcement of shatri so okay we have

381
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,919
these new sponge construction uh we can

382
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,160
have aad and hashing in the same uh

383
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,980
based on the same primitive so that kind

384
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,679
of dragged and

385
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:14,939
helped us to believe that we can

386
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,299
actually do better as a community

387
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:21,839
than AES GCM plus sha2 together for

388
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,579
replications

389
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,699
right so use a different Dynamic

390
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,299
compared with a post Quantum competition

391
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,340
in that sense is is that true that the

392
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,380
impression that I got that

393
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,059
I mean there's no clear threat right uh

394
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,700
so we have something an unknown threat

395
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,720
in post Quantum that okay and algorithm

396
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,000
something will happen and we're going to

397
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,620
have quantum computer and then all

398
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,600
crypto is broken so it's not going to be

399
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,880
like that we just wanted to make sure

400
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,160
that okay in the

401
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,500
um in the field we are aware of some

402
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,539
devices some microcontrollers that

403
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:04,080
cannot Implement AES GCM plus hashing if

404
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,480
they want you know if the application

405
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,940
needs it so we

406
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,820
we want to make sure that you know we

407
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,400
want to cover some of these devices that

408
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,919
cannot actually Implement AES and kind

409
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,360
of raise the bar a little bit

410
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,000
but it's different from pqc okay thank

411
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,480
you uh so Joanne do you have an opinion

412
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,280
on this

413
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,320
what you want to share

414
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,140
yeah that I don't know do you mean how

415
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,020
the process went and who the people that

416
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,020
were interested I think you have a lot

417
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,840
of symmetric crypto researchers that

418
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,280
want to have something to do and

419
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,020
lightweight is something interesting to

420
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,580
do so now we have a new thing is like

421
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,860
symmetra crypto over non-binary fields

422
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,840
that's now the new hot thing so people

423
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,340
need something to do because they

424
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,320
started the PHD and the PSD has to be

425
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,799
finished so that's how I see it

426
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,580
okay I don't think that has a strong

427
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,039
drive from industry

428
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,559
so when I was at St at the impression

429
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,320
that AES could deal with a lot of use

430
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,400
cases so but maybe I I didn't see all

431
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,260
the applications

432
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,919
right okay got it uh what do you think

433
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,679
or uh would you like to make a comment

434
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,539
here so yes so I think the the

435
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:32,880
it's complicated because and and this is

436
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,559
part of the full disclosure you know I

437
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,320
had a submission to niece together with

438
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,600
Roberto avanci and a few other guys from

439
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,960
arm and I think arm is a very large

440
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,700
company so you can say oh arm at least

441
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,460
was interested to some extent uh but it

442
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,400
was uh kicked out after the first round

443
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,720
so

444
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,179
first of all full disclosure in case I

445
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,220
sound a bit bitter I'm not but if you

446
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,660
happen to hear some bitterness in my

447
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,280
voices because this made a mistake uh

448
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,919
um but seriously though I I think that

449
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:06,539
there are two reasons for that somewhere

450
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,280
between what Johan said because I think

451
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,200
that also people doing algebraic or

452
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,880
mathematical cryptography also have to

453
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,400
graduate at some point of time

454
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,620
um so why why don't we have a public

455
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,720
competition not just post Quantum and

456
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,600
crypto we can have lightweight public we

457
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,100
can do many competitions competitions

458
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,500
are fun the fact that we had two panels

459
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,539
before and we have one afterwards and I

460
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:30,780
I think that in the last 20 years we had

461
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,280
at least five or six of those

462
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,780
competitions

463
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,059
um

464
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,500
but but I think that it's also a matter

465
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,000
of

466
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,900
yeah

467
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,780
the set of infrastructure that needs to

468
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,620
be changed or updated I mean we can do

469
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,440
lightweight without bugging Intel or arm

470
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,100
or any of the large companies usually

471
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,900
lightweight crypto is done inside some

472
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,000
domain right it's a Samsung controller

473
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,340
speaking with a Samsung device it's not

474
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,159
something which has to be cross-platform

475
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,799
so the players are usually more like oh

476
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,080
yeah they can choose whatever they want

477
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,179
when it comes to post Quantum crypto

478
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:10,620
because think of the infrastructure

479
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,659
think of the infrastructure like if

480
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:15,000
Google changes the public equipment pki

481
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,460
and Microsoft doesn't change the pki

482
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,840
accordingly this is going to be a

483
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,480
complete mess so this is a much larger

484
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,539
scale problem because again it's not

485
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,940
something small in a small domain and

486
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,760
this is probably why they're also very

487
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,940
much interested in the program

488
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,820
process this I'm not sure earlier I

489
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,260
didn't see I don't see if the audience

490
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,760
is currently flawed with people but I

491
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,700
would expect again seeing less people

492
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,220
from Microsoft or Google or that sort of

493
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,539
stuff compared to previous talks

494
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,940
okay okay thank you

495
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,340
um yes

496
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,159
yes yes yes yes uh uh yeah so partially

497
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,900
uh so what are uh was saying uh uh I I

498
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,280
agree uh so we have some some very

499
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,640
practical example uh so for instance all

500
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,080
the keyless application for opening car

501
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,960
so that in the last 20 years that was a

502
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,679
very cost-driven solution

503
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:21,600
so in the sense that in particular in

504
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,640
the remote that you keep in your pocket

505
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,620
for opening the car or just when you

506
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,260
close yeah close by the car can can be

507
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,020
open without even pushing the button so

508
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,179
usually is a company that sells the

509
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,039
solution so both the remote and the

510
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,820
receiver that you plug in the car and so

511
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,520
in the value chain so there is this

512
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,500
company that is doing this solution and

513
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,840
then it's sold to a company that then

514
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,740
sell these uh to the car maker and at

515
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,380
the end user nobody care if that is done

516
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,440
with AES or with whatever as far as

517
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,980
someone is not stealing his car which is

518
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,140
something that is changing dramatically

519
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,679
the last uh in the last years just where

520
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,080
you can see more and more car hacking

521
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,159
where bad designs use because they are

522
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:12,179
very cheap

523
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,000
start to become a problem for the car

524
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,320
okay so this is a point where Industries

525
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,600
might be interested in a competition

526
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,559
like this for lightweight because

527
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,179
they start to be okay just I'm not very

528
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:30,480
happy that so my supplier is always

529
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,220
something that I don't really understand

530
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,500
what is inside and maybe even they don't

531
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,299
know what is inside and then there is

532
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,400
another company that have made a design

533
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,360
like 20 years ago with a lfsr that some

534
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,059
bits here and there and so on so this is

535
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:48,480
where uh so for instance car maker can

536
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,520
say okay just now I want to have guys

537
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,179
find that the the the the keyless device

538
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:56,100
is very cheap but I would like to have

539
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,260
some more security compared to the one

540
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,940
that that is here

541
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,520
I also agree that we are talking about

542
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,000
two different problems for the community

543
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,480
so the post-quantum

544
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,860
competition it's really look like there

545
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,679
could be an apocalypse in a couple of

546
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,419
years

547
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:18,600
always through this we will see if this

548
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,640
is true that we'll have really quantum

549
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,620
computer that will be able to do

550
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,260
something useful not only breaking

551
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,440
crypto but useful in the general sense

552
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,320
and when they will be but I think it's

553
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,539
it's good to start to preparing for

554
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,600
these cases and then post Quantum crypto

555
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,679
algorithm

556
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,620
while in the case of lightweight we are

557
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,720
really trying to optimize costs so it's

558
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,919
not that if you want to do so an RFID so

559
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,140
also in the case of RFID we have seen

560
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,440
history of proprietary cryptographic

561
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,320
algorithm that the poor guy that was

562
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,240
working in the silico industry was

563
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,120
forced to make with the fuel transistor

564
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,600
something that was working

565
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,640
and after a few years that was

566
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,700
completely broken one the the algorithm

567
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,799
construction was understood and then it

568
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,440
was clear that he so today we start to

569
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,679
have a RFID tag with AES so the cost is

570
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,480
a little bit higher so again if we have

571
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,700
a good standard we can reduce the cost

572
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,559
of the tag

573
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,020
but it's not a problem that you can

574
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,720
compare with let's say ECC is broken by

575
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,419
a quantum computer or RSA is factored by

576
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,340
a Quantum Computing Source right it's

577
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,480
really

578
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,799
but that's yes that's a good point fair

579
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,679
enough okay thank you very much uh with

580
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,900
this we have uh completed the first

581
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,779
stage of this uh Roundtable where

582
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,900
um thanks to our panelists we have set

583
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,539
up I think very nicely what is the

584
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,820
problem what is lightweight uh crypto

585
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,419
agility I will now go to move to another

586
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,880
phase where I will ask you more targeted

587
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,419
questions uh to each one of you but of

588
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,840
course anyone can can uh have a second

589
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,000
opinion and I would like to to have that

590
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,360
so that we can have uh nice academic

591
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,240
debate here so my first question I would

592
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,480
like to ask uh first Milton Milton

593
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,720
um what's your opinion about nice

594
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,940
lightweight lightweight standardization

595
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,100
process uh do you think that it has

596
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,919
achieved its main goals uh how is it

597
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,900
going what what would be your your

598
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,900
opinion your expert super extra opinion

599
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,460
about it okay so we started this process

600
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,320
not the competition but before

601
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,220
discussing in 2015 so we it's it's been

602
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,919
seven years right and

603
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,900
um and we're hoping that the competition

604
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,240
phase of this process to be End by the

605
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,059
end of this year so we're still not uh

606
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,260
finished yet

607
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,960
so we select the winner hopefully one

608
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,080
winner instead of two or multiple and

609
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,659
then the next step is to writing the

610
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:04,820
standard

611
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,240
and only after that you know the

612
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,340
industry will start implementing it and

613
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,440
it will be in the field and hopefully be

614
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,240
used uh for protection uh so in terms of

615
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,039
timeline of course we are not there yet

616
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,380
we still have at least one year maybe

617
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,960
one and a half year to go there but

618
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,299
compared to successful so far so we

619
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:33,179
where we are right now so we can have

620
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:35,279
I'm actually happy with the

621
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,440
standardization process so far because

622
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,260
you know we got a lot of feedback from

623
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,960
um Academia and also from industry it's

624
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,659
not like I mean I mean from the previous

625
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:48,179
question it I it should not sound like

626
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:51,539
we actually started without any you know

627
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,520
feedback from the industry we got

628
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,100
feedback from industry and after the

629
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,820
call we received a significant amount of

630
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,279
submission so we received 56 submissions

631
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:06,360
which is a good number for this uh

632
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,100
specific problem and uh and then also we

633
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,659
received significant amount of

634
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,880
third-party analysis especially in the

635
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,159
first part of first two rounds of the

636
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:18,840
competition

637
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,000
and a lot of groups doing the

638
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,279
benchmarking software benchmarking

639
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,320
Hardware benchmarking now we're doing uh

640
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,380
protected implementations so I'm happy

641
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,899
with the interest and the feedback that

642
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:33,779
we are getting from the community to so

643
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,539
that we could select a winner that is

644
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:41,299
acceptable for um almost everyone so um

645
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:44,100
so what I want to say is so far we've

646
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,039
reached our goal goals uh there has been

647
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,200
some delay we were hoping to be finished

648
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,520
Maybe

649
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,520
earlier but you know things happens and

650
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,520
uh some of the workshops that we plan to

651
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,220
do turned out to be virtual and things

652
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,440
got delayed but

653
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,220
um

654
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,440
where but we're still on track and

655
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,559
hopefully by the end of this next year I

656
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,120
mean this year we have we will have the

657
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,640
winners and then soon after that we will

658
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,520
uh write the standards so

659
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,700
okay thank you

660
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,279
yeah just to confirm to our audience

661
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,500
here and online uh so you are talking

662
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,080
about multiple winners right winners

663
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,980
with uh so we're hoping for one winner

664
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,539
uh so

665
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,840
it could be two but we really want to

666
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,600
hope we're hoping for one and we see

667
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,419
that in microcontrollers AES is still

668
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,960
doing good and small microcontrollers uh

669
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,440
maybe you know having multiple attacks

670
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,700
multiple

671
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,440
um

672
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,500
standards is the multiple standards is

673
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,340
hard hard to manage and so we're hoping

674
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,520
to just find out the places where AES

675
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,039
don't perform well and to support the

676
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,799
AES okay thank you that's very

677
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,720
interesting and very insightful thank

678
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,860
you uh Joanne or Guido anyone wants to

679
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,740
yes Guido please yeah I have I have a

680
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,539
comment on this

681
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:18,899
so I I think just if we look at the

682
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:23,220
pasta the AES was really a great success

683
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,679
so in the sense that after the standard

684
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,960
so the industry try immediately to to

685
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,720
get it working because so particular for

686
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,520
the software implementation it was

687
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,100
giving a lot of benefit compared to this

688
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,080
or triple dash of rc4 so that I think

689
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,179
was a a very good case of standard that

690
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,480
tellsy the industry was really waiting

691
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,679
for it

692
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:55,620
and I don't know if we have another good

693
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,840
example of a cryptographic algorithm

694
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,640
that has been standardized and that that

695
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,000
success because it was really filling a

696
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,580
gap immediately so I can imagine that

697
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,460
maybe chatri maybe

698
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,820
not sorry I'm really sorry about this I

699
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,620
mean just the standard is just great but

700
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,380
just the adoption I I don't see it as a

701
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,380
as a as like

702
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,380
uh industry was running to to throw away

703
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,659
Chateau and say okay just just use

704
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,179
chatri and just it's almost the opposite

705
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,039
so everybody at the end of the chatri

706
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,620
competition was Chateau is still good

707
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,860
enough so I can still continue to use it

708
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,039
and just wait when it's broken and and

709
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,580
and changing so I really don't see so

710
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,260
that that is maybe the example

711
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,019
unfortunately where uh let's see we

712
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:52,320
haven't seen the standardized algorith

713
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,799
going to feel a gap

714
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,940
that the industry was was waiting

715
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,500
so

716
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,299
most likely we will see that the results

717
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:06,960
of the of the lightweight competition in

718
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,779
two five years so that will be the time

719
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,100
frame because

720
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,559
for designing a chip you cannot take

721
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,320
less than two years so even if you rush

722
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,980
as much as possible so it means that

723
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,320
once the standard is written because the

724
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,799
competition

725
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,700
will end

726
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,519
hopefully and in this year but then say

727
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,019
it will take a little bit of time to

728
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:32,399
write the standards not that you have

729
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,620
immediate the standard so in the case

730
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,640
for instance of of shot three uh it was

731
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,380
a very particular time frame uh with say

732
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,480
all the event of of uh

733
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,120
allegedly uh needs involved in other

734
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,700
things that I think is was not really

735
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,940
the case but mistake really a slow pace

736
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,360
for for writing the chatri and and also

737
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,000
to tune the parameters so in that case

738
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,120
the the algorith was quite flexible in

739
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,539
terms of parameters and so I think there

740
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:12,840
was a very long debate and and I think

741
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,899
nice did a good job from my point of

742
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:19,100
view to try to have a standard that was

743
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,919
fitting many different things

744
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,799
so I hope that let's say there will be a

745
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,159
nice standard out of the of these of

746
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:30,440
this competition

747
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,980
and uh yeah so so the the reality of

748
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,019
being applied since so is not a an algae

749
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,659
that most like will be used in software

750
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,980
unless maybe it's going to be very

751
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,080
peculiar and very good in software so so

752
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,260
we have also the case of Cha-Cha that

753
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,200
start to be adopted by some players

754
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,360
instead of AES because in some platforms

755
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,279
was

756
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:01,320
performing better than so Pure

757
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,960
Performance in software was better than

758
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,639
AES so if this algorithm might come to

759
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,520
be very handy in some application then

760
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,440
let's say the industry will start to

761
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,899
adopt it otherwise they will start to

762
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:19,079
understand okay when I really have to

763
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:21,540
implement it or what is the opportunity

764
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,199
to uh example a new algorithm and gain a

765
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,300
market share or let's say a market where

766
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,159
I can reduce the cost

767
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,520
okay thank you okay or do you want to

768
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,099
have an opinion in this yeah I I just

769
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,918
want to put a bit agreed going to said

770
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,480
in context because you have to remember

771
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,199
that shastri 3 started in in times that

772
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,480
each and every morning we had a new hash

773
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,639
function which has been broken

774
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,460
and I mean this was very turbulent times

775
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,739
in cryptography so nist was working

776
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,300
under a lot of pressure from the

777
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,460
community but also from industry because

778
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,079
they had to start the competition and

779
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,760
suddenly because everybody were focused

780
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,400
on the competition we stopped for

781
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,460
working on shot 256 and shot 512 so to

782
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,740
some extent nist succeeded in in

783
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,500
bringing us uh

784
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,619
to fix the disturbance in the force by

785
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,900
having this competition

786
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,240
um now another thing is that one of the

787
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,460
reasons uh going to I don't know if guys

788
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,920
if you guys remember that when nist came

789
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,700
to standardize shastri they at some

790
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,560
point started saying oh let's tweak the

791
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,839
parameters to some extent if you

792
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:33,000
remember the story and this was just

793
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,820
after snowden's Revelations and then

794
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,220
nobody trusted the knees that said oh

795
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,660
we're going to reduce the high level

796
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,020
security version of uh

797
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,460
ketchup when we're transitioned to shaft

798
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,180
3 so if it were a bit upset about that

799
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,079
um so again if I if I can refer to my

800
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,119
previous comment and and taking into

801
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,099
consideration what gorido and Melton

802
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,800
said I mean yes the the industry needs

803
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,359
to feel that there is a huge advantage

804
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:03,240
to for adopting the new standard but

805
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,660
again it's a matter of the ecosystem if

806
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,460
most likely cryptography is done inside

807
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,839
your house

808
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,119
then it's less of an issue if most of

809
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,140
the electorate cryptography we're

810
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,520
discussing is going to be over the

811
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,040
internet then the incentives of

812
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,839
interoperability are going to be

813
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:21,300
significantly higher so unless there is

814
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,940
going to be a very strong

815
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,740
requirement by standardization bodies or

816
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,960
regulatory bodies like you know in

817
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,780
California where currently you are there

818
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,700
are laws saying that the iot devices

819
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,359
cannot have default passwords

820
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,859
if there will be such a requirement by

821
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:39,420
law in California yes it's going to

822
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,000
propagate throughout the world that oh

823
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,119
you need to have iot devices using the

824
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,500
winner of the lightweight crypto

825
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,780
competition but I suspect this is not

826
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,000
going to be standardized sorry not

827
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,260
standardized as well but

828
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,980
to become a law even in California

829
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,119
okay

830
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,660
okay thank you uh uh or uh do you want

831
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,240
do you want to add something about it no

832
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,359
I have nothing to that okay then uh

833
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,880
taking advantage of it we are we fear at

834
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,500
the moment then they have a targeted

835
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,180
question for you

836
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,480
um I remember uh John that you have a

837
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,520
very nice design that rolls of turanian

838
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,160
uh what happened what could you give us

839
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,460
an opinion uh it was in the competition

840
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,000
and yeah

841
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,980
it could be a question to melt them I

842
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,440
guess because I don't know how they on

843
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,420
Earth they could have not selected it

844
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,020
but yeah

845
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,579
but but your opinion about the

846
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:43,079
performance of social media

847
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:45,200
yeah but you can see that in the

848
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,520
benchmarks the hardware benchmarks you

849
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,440
can see the the performance

850
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,640
okay

851
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,920
so there is nothing to say that the

852
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,220
numbers speak for themselves so

853
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,060
okay what can I say yeah okay I will

854
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,920
follow your advice and I will ask melt

855
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,420
them Milton are you do you have any

856
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,720
comment at all or

857
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,940
Subterranean had uh one of the best

858
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,240
perform performance among all the uh

859
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,460
second round candidates but the concern

860
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,200
was the

861
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,500
was the security concern there was this

862
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,660
um unfortunately I don't remember the

863
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,240
authors of the uh paper but there was a

864
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,599
security concern uh

865
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:30,060
that's made us not go with Subterranean

866
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,920
for the finalists but they are all

867
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,859
included in our final report the second

868
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:36,180
round report

869
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,640
okay thank you thank you

870
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,099
okay so let's move to my targeted

871
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:43,260
question two or don't tell many I think

872
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,579
that you are going to like my question

873
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:49,380
or let's see uh recently like three

874
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,440
years ago you published a paper in what

875
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,440
I think is the opposite to agility you

876
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,119
publish a paper in rigidity

877
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,300
so could you give us uh what's what's

878
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,079
your rigidity and if it's compatible at

879
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,920
all with agility

880
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,260
and Agility at the same time

881
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,420
yes because originally worked in the

882
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,180
standardization level and the problem is

883
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,720
that if you look at the

884
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,160
symmetrical cryptography or Primitives

885
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,960
when they're being standardized we have

886
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,000
to trust the designers so they didn't

887
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,160
put in any vectors

888
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,619
so for example we have to trust you on

889
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,599
that the constants that were chosen for

890
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,900
AES are good ones now I don't know about

891
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,240
you guys I personally trust you and but

892
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,040
I can see someone saying oh I don't like

893
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,599
them because it's from the Flemish part

894
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,579
of Belgium which is known to contain

895
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:47,880
people from the slavish part of Belgium

896
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,859
um so

897
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:52,619
people are maybe worried and and you

898
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,000
have to remember this is in the context

899
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,180
of things like kosniachik and

900
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,359
yeah I forgot an egg

901
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,880
uh the name of the hash functions that

902
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,319
uses three block

903
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,800
uh where the Xbox contains structure and

904
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,599
it was not revealed but I just

905
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,540
standardized it and

906
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,460
I think it's also an ietf standardized

907
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,319
in some RFC

908
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,440
um so the idea of rigidity is that

909
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,839
the designer

910
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,060
is going to commit to various

911
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,700
requirements but then the final decision

912
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,220
of the s books and we in use or the

913
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,680
rotation constants in use or that sort

914
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,180
of stuff is going to be done by the

915
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,599
standardization part so it's kind of

916
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,160
weird when you think about it especially

917
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,020
because you now have to trust the

918
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,300
standardization body so maybe I don't

919
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,280
trust you maybe I trust you but I don't

920
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,680
trust me I mean it's a bit more

921
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,900
complicated than that

922
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,119
um but it shifts the trust slightly

923
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,760
different it distributes the trust now

924
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,920
Johan can say okay I'm designing

925
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,180
something with the back door and I'm

926
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,980
sorry that I'm picking on you I'm going

927
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,280
to move to Greedo I agree to myself I

928
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,280
can pick on you okay so uh I'm going to

929
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,900
try and design something with a backdoor

930
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,760
in the s books but then the civilization

931
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,680
body

932
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,720
gets the full disclosure of what are the

933
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,240
design criteria and then the body

934
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,280
selects the Xbox now there are problems

935
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,560
with rigidity for once for example it

936
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,500
assumes of the sanitization body has the

937
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,460
capacity and the expertise in doing

938
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,839
something like that

939
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,819
okay another problem is that as I said

940
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:31,440
you have to trust the standardization

941
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,900
body but on the other hand it now we

942
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,060
have there there is sort of like two

943
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,740
bodies that you have to trust and you

944
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,260
have reduced trust in each of them you

945
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,119
don't need to have full trust in both of

946
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:44,099
them and if the designer is doing

947
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:48,180
something which is is good then in

948
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,180
theory we can we should have sort of

949
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,640
like an assurance you know think of the

950
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,339
sponge functions plug in any good

951
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:58,260
permutation it's supposed to give you a

952
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,040
good primitive right so

953
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,280
from that perspective you submit the

954
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,319
sponge and say oh I want that and that

955
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:10,440
and that parameters and then it's the

956
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,720
job of this musician body to do that it

957
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,960
doesn't mean agility I mean there they

958
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,960
can still be multiple

959
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,400
standards it's just that each of them

960
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,740
will be selected in a slightly different

961
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,420
manner

962
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,420
um it it echoes a bit the

963
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,420
if we started this research started from

964
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,220
the elliptic curves where the selection

965
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,720
of the curve and the selections of the

966
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,940
points is it's a bit more easier to

967
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,099
Outsource this to the

968
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,260
sanitization body but

969
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,440
this was the motivating example

970
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,680
okay okay thank you uh any one of you

971
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,839
would like to ask something about this

972
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:52,760
maybe I can add something so a wine list

973
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,260
writes the calls for these algorithms

974
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,060
they always say okay what are your

975
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,760
tunable parameters this is kind of

976
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,119
similar to what Laura is saying so this

977
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,740
wanted to have a little bit of

978
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,020
flexibility while writing the standards

979
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,160
Maybe

980
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,200
in case we want to increase the number

981
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,720
of rounds or maybe decrease

982
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,000
depending on the performance of the

983
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,940
available attacks so uh this is actually

984
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,740
something

985
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,780
this is already thinking but there's

986
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,200
always a big pushback whenever you know

987
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,359
Mist wants to do slight changes to the

988
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,859
algorithms

989
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:32,520
okay well just wanted to say that this

990
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,700
is actually part of the call we say okay

991
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,560
what are your tunable parameters what

992
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,619
can you change without you know

993
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:42,900
invalidating the current attacks

994
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,900
um

995
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,780
yeah but it goes back to sorry it goes

996
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,640
back to a matter of trust do you trust

997
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,779
needs to make these changes

998
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,520
sure but they all went to public

999
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,280
comments right all the decisions go for

1000
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,839
public comments

1001
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:04,560
especially algorithms

1002
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,599
yeah but the thing is that Nissan I

1003
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,700
think this is what we saw was in Duality

1004
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,319
and also in this competition now we've

1005
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,599
seen this week I I I I I couldn't attend

1006
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,760
the post Quantum sessions so I have no

1007
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,339
idea what's going on there but we see

1008
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:20,099
that there is a claim that nist has a

1009
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:23,280
secret advice a string coming from the

1010
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,040
NSA it was in the AES we know it was in

1011
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,020
the chatri we know and yes it's also

1012
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,960
intellectual crypto competition and

1013
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,180
it's not that everything is public

1014
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,980
and and I think this this is the matter

1015
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,240
of the trust here which is a very

1016
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,280
delicate

1017
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,079
I mean at least I can say for the

1018
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,760
lightweight crypto

1019
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,140
standardization process after the

1020
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,119
algorithms that you know the company

1021
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,760
after the

1022
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,800
round one candidates

1023
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,880
received and published there were no

1024
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,040
communication but before that we we were

1025
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,040
involved with for example we invited

1026
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,960
couple of NSA researchers to our

1027
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,420
workshops for the panel and invited

1028
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,920
speakers but there is no on public

1029
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,800
information for the lightweight crypto

1030
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,079
project I mean I'm not members of all

1031
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,240
the other projects so I don't know but

1032
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,000
uh I can say for lightweight crypto

1033
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,579
project this is uh all the comments that

1034
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:26,839
we received uh we want to receive it

1035
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:29,640
through our Forum of course in this

1036
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,680
sometimes the companies reach out saying

1037
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,740
we actually want this for for example

1038
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,260
memory encryption as well or we have

1039
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,500
this application not everything goes to

1040
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,079
public sometimes we talk in the

1041
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,720
conference with people in the during the

1042
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,880
coffee break it doesn't go to the public

1043
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,020
but

1044
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,359
anything that goes into the decision

1045
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,880
phase we try to put it in the report

1046
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,400
but you know there there should be

1047
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,579
I understand there the the decisions the

1048
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:04,859
selections are subjective maybe another

1049
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:07,560
group makes the same decisions they

1050
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,540
select a different number of candidates

1051
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,940
or a different selection it could be

1052
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,339
different winner but um that's part of

1053
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:17,220
the problem it's really a hard

1054
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:21,359
uh problem to select a winner from 10

1055
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,760
good algorithms or 10 strong teams it's

1056
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,619
uh I understand that the trust is an

1057
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,540
issue but

1058
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,579
you know everybody wants to do their

1059
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:34,819
best

1060
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,619
okay okay

1061
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:41,099
thank you so um let me let me move to

1062
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:44,160
the question that I have prepared for uh

1063
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,819
Widow Bertoni uh Guido as a Harvard is

1064
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:50,280
an expert I have this question for you

1065
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,500
in practice or correct me if I'm wrong

1066
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,359
I'm most of the required hardware area

1067
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,339
of a cryptographic lightweight algorithm

1068
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:59,040
is spent in the store in a circuit key

1069
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,480
material

1070
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,300
um how useful can be to have new

1071
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,240
algorithms that are lightweight even if

1072
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,119
they are extremely light if anyway they

1073
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,579
they would require to store the secret

1074
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,520
key that takes a lot of the area for the

1075
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,260
design is that true or what would be

1076
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,480
your opinion about it what

1077
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,440
so that if you look at the a device so

1078
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,819
like a RFA tag so the storage of the

1079
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:33,660
secret key is an issue so so there are

1080
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,380
companies that are doing uh very

1081
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:40,140
particularly Innovative way for storing

1082
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,900
keys that are based on a platform

1083
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,660
physical function but if you don't use

1084
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,300
this then you need to have a very

1085
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,300
dedicated memory cell that are

1086
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,579
non-volatized so that you write once the

1087
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,859
key and the key will be there for a very

1088
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:57,359
long time and

1089
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,520
you want some security on it so that

1090
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,680
with with microscope you you don't go

1091
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,200
every zero one zero one where there is a

1092
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,980
key and so on so that type of sets are

1093
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,859
quite big

1094
00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:13,079
but it's a fixed cost if you want to

1095
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:14,880
store the key to store the key this is

1096
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,220
not something so sometimes if you look

1097
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:21,720
at an FID tag indeed say is not that 90

1098
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,480
of the Silicon area is the cryptographic

1099
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,300
algorithm so there are other things that

1100
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,819
are taking so so for instance all the RF

1101
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:33,300
part so putting data on on the radio is

1102
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,359
also taking a a big part and some logic

1103
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:38,520
and some memory and so on so it's true

1104
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,500
that sometimes if you look at the

1105
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,900
overall budget of your area it's not the

1106
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,180
cryptographic algorithms take a huge

1107
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:49,680
path so maybe it's 20 30 so but when you

1108
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,800
are producing millions and millions even

1109
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,380
reducing a little part is still you're

1110
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,119
still talking about money so if you

1111
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,640
carry reduce the cost it's good enough

1112
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,900
so

1113
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,880
sometimes if the the cost of the area so

1114
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,920
the size of the area is look a little

1115
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,680
bit naively and say oh just I'm reducing

1116
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,319
just a small percentage but that small

1117
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:15,180
percentage when when you're talking

1118
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,180
about maybe billions of Chip becomes

1119
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,339
let's say as a result in an interesting

1120
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:24,540
cost so I wouldn't do this just to say

1121
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,480
okay maybe we should standardize a

1122
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,059
better way of storing keys in Silicon so

1123
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:32,099
that is really I think is is the

1124
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:34,020
business of the of the industry in

1125
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,260
everyone find that the best way to

1126
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,599
produce this cell why let's say the

1127
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,819
cryptographic algorithm should be let's

1128
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:44,099
say as small as possible still with with

1129
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:46,260
a reasonable security

1130
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,960
okay okay fair enough thank you very

1131
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,680
much so uh comment to my audience uh

1132
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,940
don't be shy if you have questions

1133
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,099
please by all means uh ask questions

1134
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:58,260
otherwise I I have plenty of questions

1135
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,420
and I won't give you the chance to ask

1136
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,740
yours

1137
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,619
um I actually have a question about this

1138
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:07,020
punch design uh

1139
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,839
can we say that a sponge is post Quantum

1140
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,920
uh does it uh how would you consider

1141
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,500
that to design a sponge that is uh

1142
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,359
are they naturally exposed Quantum what

1143
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,098
about your opinion for instance Joan

1144
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,079
yeah what do you mean by both as a block

1145
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,240
size for more post Quantum than a sponge

1146
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,700
uh

1147
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,200
so there is this

1148
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,079
um controversy between these two models

1149
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,319
so q1 and Q2 I think they are called

1150
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,980
so in q1 you implement your crypto

1151
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,680
algorithm on a classical computer so a

1152
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,880
smart card of a laptop or phone and the

1153
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,819
attacker has a quantum computer

1154
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:56,760
and you can do Grover for instance

1155
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,720
in Q2 the crypto algorithm is also

1156
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,119
implemented on a quantum computer

1157
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,099
and you can do all kinds of stuff like

1158
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:06,900
you're making queries and superposition

1159
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,280
and so on

1160
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,099
and I believe that in I don't know I

1161
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:12,780
don't know much about post about the

1162
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,960
quantum cryptography I mean Quantum crit

1163
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,599
analysis but I believe that this sermon

1164
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:21,660
algorithm uh it's a can break sponge

1165
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,880
probably that's the source of this

1166
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,079
confusion

1167
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:28,680
but as long as you implement your

1168
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,859
crypto algorithm on a classical computer

1169
00:51:30,859 --> 00:51:33,839
then there is no advantage that block

1170
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:38,180
ciphers have with respect to sponges

1171
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,460
so if you look at for instance I worked

1172
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,180
out an example here so in zodiac for

1173
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,920
instance

1174
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,079
that's a competitor and then this

1175
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:54,420
lightweight competition

1176
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,119
um you have it's a positive key length

1177
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,460
up to run of 92 bits

1178
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:03,599
and um if you look at what the adversary

1179
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,900
can get in a generic sense that is a

1180
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,059
part of the state that is hidden that is

1181
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,680
192 bits

1182
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,099
so you can say Okay run of 92 bits

1183
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:16,200
um what people typically say is then you

1184
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,740
get 96 bits of quantum security

1185
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,480
um but if you really like take a look

1186
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,880
closer look at it

1187
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,780
so let's consider round of 28 bits AES

1188
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:31,380
what kind of Security offers that so you

1189
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,440
have to actually to use Grover you have

1190
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,140
to do about 2 to the power 64 iterations

1191
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:40,819
of a certain of a certain function

1192
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:45,240
to the power of 64. so uh and for 128

1193
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,220
bit AES

1194
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,740
so let's say one iteration takes a

1195
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,180
bigger second that would be a very

1196
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,059
powerful quantum computer I would say

1197
00:52:53,059 --> 00:52:55,559
then you can do 2 to the power 40

1198
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:58,140
iterations per second so you can find

1199
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,140
the key and 2 to the power 24 seconds so

1200
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,059
because you can do to the power 64

1201
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:04,160
iterations

1202
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,839
and to the power of 24 seconds and

1203
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:09,420
that's about half a year so a single

1204
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,300
quantum computer

1205
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,460
needs to run half a year

1206
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,800
so that's quite expensive and that's 128

1207
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,020
bits of security that supposedly reduced

1208
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:23,640
to 64 bits but if you taken of 92 that's

1209
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,960
actually uh half a billion or 2 billion

1210
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,619
um a factor 4 billion more secure now

1211
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:34,800
you can parallelize it but uh the the

1212
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,900
gain is not so much

1213
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,839
so you have to actually do when this

1214
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,420
Factor half a billion you have to

1215
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,180
paralyze it to the power 64 times so you

1216
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,579
need to occupy 2 to the power of 64.

1217
00:53:49,579 --> 00:53:52,680
quantum computers during half a year to

1218
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,260
break it and that's that's basically not

1219
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,700
better than you would could do

1220
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,000
classically so you can say that even in

1221
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,619
the nest lightweight competition there

1222
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:04,440
are algorithms that are practically uh

1223
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:09,900
Quantum uh cryptanalysis resistance

1224
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,480
thank you very much

1225
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,680
Joseph you are wondering here in the

1226
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,480
audience we didn't prepare this question

1227
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,300
on video on in advance he he has all

1228
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,940
these numbers in front of him no no no I

1229
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,059
I I got a draft a question about what is

1230
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:25,440
the Quantum security of capital

1231
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,359
algorithms I must be honest because I

1232
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,040
could not prepare that I could not make

1233
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,900
this up

1234
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,760
Sparta

1235
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,640
yeah yeah thank you thank you uh someone

1236
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,599
wants to add a comment maybe or

1237
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,280
about it nope

1238
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,480
yeah well I

1239
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,579
let's have this discussion over a beer

1240
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:50,280
in the break because the question about

1241
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,319
them I don't think that's controversary

1242
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,420
about whether it's q1 or here there are

1243
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,160
just two different models like adaptive

1244
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,920
chosen playing texture versus chosen so

1245
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,400
uh and kodu Studio on for remembering

1246
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,500
the constants by heart yeah I

1247
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,020
wrote it down

1248
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,880
so I have a question that I think is a

1249
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,040
question that that is very common

1250
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,700
um

1251
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,960
AES country 28 versus aes256 what's your

1252
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,380
opinion should be more AES condo 92.

1253
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,680
should we move or are we fine with 120

1254
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,180
bits what do you say or

1255
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,119
well I mean for the higher security

1256
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,220
whenever you have the performance

1257
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,500
penalty or the efficiency penalty

1258
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,660
acceptability so

1259
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,780
but you know if you can do as256 because

1260
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,700
of performance or efficiency then don't

1261
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,260
do it

1262
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,299
okay

1263
00:55:48,299 --> 00:55:50,960
um Guido

1264
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,220
you like yeah

1265
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,240
honestly it's just safe from a pure

1266
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,540
taste the the key schedule of 128 is

1267
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,780
very nice the other two are

1268
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:09,240
not not really just especially if you

1269
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,700
have to to design in a hardware the kiss

1270
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,520
schedule of as192 is something that you

1271
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,520
remember for a very long time because

1272
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,220
habit working right is is quite

1273
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:25,140
challenging and uh yeah but I

1274
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,540
yeah there are some some cases where

1275
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,339
let's say

1276
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:32,280
customer really wants 256.

1277
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,819
and AES 256 today yeah no not in the

1278
00:56:35,819 --> 00:56:37,859
case of lightweight but let's say if you

1279
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:41,700
have a commercial PC yeah you just don't

1280
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,160
see it so also with the dedicated

1281
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,920
instruction that you have in our Intel

1282
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:50,640
and so on are just peanuts almost

1283
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,280
okay uh Milton the Nissan

1284
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,960
Direction

1285
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,319
about aes128 256.

1286
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:06,119
so um Miss pqc of course this is part of

1287
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:08,760
the PTC problem and then there was a

1288
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,040
frequently Asked question in the website

1289
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,700
saying to protect the threads for uh

1290
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,680
quantum computers should be double the

1291
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,799
key sizes away and so okay we have uh

1292
00:57:19,799 --> 00:57:22,020
the Grover Road algorithm that

1293
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,240
quadratically

1294
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,040
um reduction on the security so uh maybe

1295
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,040
since we have AES 256 on hand available

1296
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,619
why don't we immediately

1297
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:35,540
um

1298
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:38,099
transferred to you know

1299
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:40,799
move to as256

1300
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:43,740
and that is one option but at this point

1301
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:47,280
I think the nist does not really push

1302
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,780
for this because of some of the

1303
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,760
limitations of The Growers algorithm

1304
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,680
mainly

1305
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:56,160
um some of the limitations of where you

1306
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,579
have to implement these algorithms

1307
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:01,500
sequentially rather than you know you

1308
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,000
could do

1309
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,160
um instead of running this in parallel

1310
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,460
so uh at this point this says okay don't

1311
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:12,960
use any security less than 112 and 112

1312
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,540
is going to be

1313
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,540
is also something that please try to get

1314
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,660
away uh in terms of security strength

1315
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:25,500
and so Kevin's current applications can

1316
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:30,540
continue using as 128 192 or 256 at this

1317
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:34,200
point but I I think this is uh as as we

1318
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,319
see more improvements over uh

1319
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:39,780
symmetric key algorithms the quantum

1320
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:42,660
security this might say that okay maybe

1321
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:46,799
it's not a time to switch but there's no

1322
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,140
