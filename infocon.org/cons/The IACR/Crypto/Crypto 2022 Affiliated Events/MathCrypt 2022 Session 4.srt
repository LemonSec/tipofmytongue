1
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,920
all right

2
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,320
i think it's time to start this is the

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,399
last session thank you everyone

4
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,880
for being with us right until the end

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,520
uh it's my pleasure to introduce the

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,520
last speaker of the day which is william

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,640
humans

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,800
uh in this joint work with jean francois

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,719
vias and

10
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,239
some other authors

11
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,559
and uh talking about mildly short

12
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,480
vectors in ideal lattices

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,079
of psychoatomic fields without quantum

14
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,079
computers possibly the longest title of

15
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,440
all math crypt

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,800
so

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,719
william the floor is yours

18
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,160
thank you

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,000
uh thank you everyone for being here uh

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,520
yeah so my name is will newman's like

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,680
you said mildly short vectors and ideal

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,080
lattices of psychoatomic fields without

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,600
quantum computers

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,799
uh my co-authors are trump and swapias

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,119
muhammad rashad abu kalangara klaus

26
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,560
speaker and tommy hoffman

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,040
there we go

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,119
so that brief outline of this talk we

29
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,560
want to use subfields to find

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400
approximate short vectors and ideal

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,600
lattices

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,040
by approximate short vectors we're

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,799
referring to something called something

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,040
that we call a mildly short vector this

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,119
is a vector of a lattice which is within

36
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,400
a

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,439
approximation factor of 2 to the o tilde

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,360
skirt and of the shortest vector of the

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,439
lattice sub-exponential approximation

40
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,159
factor uh if you're familiar with gamma

41
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,320
svp the gamma shortest vector problem

42
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,360
this is just a variant of that

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,640
and one of the main ingredients are

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,479
going to be using is

45
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,840
uh bios feeker hofmann page 2020

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,439
normalization and computational problems

47
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,759
and number fields they

48
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,320
present classical methods that allow us

49
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,959
to reduce problems in number fields

50
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,640
to problems in their subfields

51
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,680
so a brief background on this so

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,599
2016 kramer ducasse pi curtin regev

53
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,440
showed with a classical computer there's

54
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,599
an efficient reduction of the short

55
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
principle ideal problem and principle

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,239
ideals of power of two psychotomics to

57
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,160
the principal ideal problem a short

58
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,599
principle ideal problem being just

59
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,280
finding a short generator of a principle

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,160
ideal

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,000
principle ideal problem defining a

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,360
generator

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,800
uh and kramer because wesilowski in a

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,040
series of papers show that with uh with

65
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,319
a quantum computer they have an

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,480
efficient reduction from the search for

67
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,519
a mildly short vector in general ideals

68
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,239
of these power of two psychotomics to

69
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,920
the principle ideal problem

70
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,519
and we'll refer to this reduction as

71
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,800
cramer's prosperous velocity cdw

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,640
so the cdw approach extended the cdpr

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,480
approach by introducing the close

74
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,879
principal multiple problem the idea

75
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,720
being that if we have a general idea

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,959
that may not be principle we search for

77
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,080
a close ideal that is principle that we

78
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,760
can use instead

79
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,400
so the close principle multiple problem

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,640
uh just a recap

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,519
the ideal class group is the

82
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,040
multiplicative group of fractional

83
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,040
ideals modulo principal fractional

84
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,560
ideals

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
and it gives us equivalence classes of

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,120
ideals so a and b as ideals are

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,799
equivalent if there is a number field

88
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,599
element alpha such that a equals alpha

89
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,200
times b

90
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,319
and

91
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,000
we will also be using a minus part of

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,040
the class group which is that clk minus

93
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,440
it's a subgroup of the class group and

94
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,000
uh it contains ideal classes

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,319
where the norm of that

96
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,519
representative down to from k to k plus

97
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,000
k plus being a totally real subfield

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,560
is principle what that means is that the

99
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,799
minus part of the class group is the

100
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,599
kernel of the relative norm map from k

101
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,799
to k plus

102
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,959
uh when acting on ideal classes

103
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,799
so the goal of the close principal

104
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,879
multiple problem like i said is given

105
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,238
and ideally we want to find another

106
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,279
ideal so that a times b is principle and

107
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,839
b is not too much larger doesn't grow

108
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,440
too fast

109
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,240
so

110
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,720
some of the steps in brief

111
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,120
we start by multiplying our input ideal

112
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,040
with random small ideals

113
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,840
uh these a sub zero until the class of

114
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,600
the product is in the minus part of the

115
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,120
class group

116
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,280
then we want to decompose this product

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,720
and the minus part of the class group

118
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,240
according to a set of generators

119
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,639
which generate the minus part of the

120
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,240
class curve and so we want say a

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,080
decomposition of

122
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
alpha prime inverse

123
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,000
to look like this so the alpha prime

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
inverse is equivalent to the product of

125
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,400
these prime ideals to the exponents tis

126
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
when we do this then we can find

127
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,000
a vector v of a particular lattice

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
called the projected stickleburger

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,680
lattice that annihilates the minus part

130
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
of the class curve uh we won't go into

131
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,479
detail on all that but if we find a

132
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,639
vector close enough to our input vector

133
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,960
or exponent vector t

134
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,560
then we can find a solution to this

135
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,800
close principal multiple problem

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,960
which is just this ideal we'll define b

137
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,759
as

138
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,240
uh a0 times the product of the pi so the

139
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
ti minus vi's

140
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,400
then this thing is equivalent in the

141
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,280
class group to a inverse meaning that

142
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,320
a times b will be a principle ideal

143
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,479
so since a b is principle and close to a

144
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,960
roughly in norm

145
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,360
a short generator of the product a b

146
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,840
will give us a mildly short vector of a

147
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,479
itself

148
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,479
so one of the core techniques that we

149
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,520
use

150
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
to do this is going to be normalizations

151
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,479
from uh introduced by a beyond speaker

152
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,880
hoffman page

153
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
so let k be a galwa

154
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,680
algebraic number field if k has a norm

155
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,360
relation then for all invertible

156
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,800
elements of k

157
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
we have this identity which is that x to

158
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
the d is equal to the product of the

159
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,440
relative norms down to subfields

160
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,720
fixed by h i h i being sub groups of the

161
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,039
galway group of k

162
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,240
with these exponents a i b i just being

163
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,720
integers and d being uh greater than

164
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,080
zero

165
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,639
and we call d the denominator of the

166
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,120
normulation we also call these exponents

167
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,560
bi and ai the coefficients of the norm

168
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,160
relation

169
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,919
so a couple things that are very useful

170
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,440
about norm relations

171
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,240
uh is that well say we want information

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,360
about

173
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,280
elements of k

174
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,039
or let's just say powers of elements of

175
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,960
k all we have to do is take these

176
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,319
relative norms down to these subfields

177
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,160
and do what we want there and then we

178
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,400
can recombine this information according

179
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,840
to this normalization and now we have uh

180
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,400
our information on this power of our

181
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,479
element of k but of course we don't

182
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,560
always want to work with powers or k to

183
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,280
the d

184
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,720
so we want to take roots and that's

185
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,800
going to be a theme that we'll see a

186
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,440
couple times um and another thing to

187
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
note too is that this doesn't rule out

188
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
the case of d being equal to one in

189
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,199
which case we have the denominator one

190
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,080
normulation uh and these occur and they

191
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,400
give us um a very

192
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,039
cheap basically free way of working uh

193
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,440
in a field by just working directly in

194
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,919
subfields

195
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,639
so a special case of normulations

196
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,880
is in the in in the case when we have

197
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,360
we're working with an availing field

198
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,680
in this case k has a normulation if and

199
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,400
only if it's not cyclic

200
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,840
and in this case we actually have an

201
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,280
explicit formula to produce the

202
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,840
normalization

203
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,440
so this is just to give you a taste of

204
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,800
it but

205
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,199
we basically just enumerate uh cyclic

206
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,120
subgroups of the gamma group

207
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,360
um to get our

208
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,840
subgroups uh and fixed fields that will

209
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,560
be our subfields in the normalization

210
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,800
uh and these this sort of formula will

211
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
give us our coefficients of the

212
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,240
normulation

213
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
and this is the mobius mu function in

214
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,840
the sum there

215
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
and so it's not hard to compute an

216
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,039
explicit normalization

217
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,840
given in a billion field especially

218
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,919
and what's very nice about this formula

219
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,000
is that it's actually optimal in terms

220
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,720
of the denominator of the normulation

221
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,799
as well as the degree of the subfields

222
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,640
that it involves because of course we

223
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,880
want uh subfields that have very small

224
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,120
degree so that we get the most out of

225
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,839
our normulation

226
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,159
so the degree of these subfields is

227
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,000
determined

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,680
by the largest cyclic factor of the

229
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,519
galway group

230
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,800
and in fact in the case of a cycloatomic

231
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
field

232
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,440
the degree of the subfield is bounded by

233
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,760
lambda m which is the carmichael lambda

234
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,880
function

235
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,560
which just gives the size of the largest

236
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,800
cyclic factor

237
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,399
but it's very useful to know that

238
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,519
and some things we can do with

239
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,200
normulations there are a number of

240
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,040
things you can do but one is uh

241
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,000
recursive computation of s units

242
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,800
uh so the s unit group uh just as a

243
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,760
recap is the multiplicative group

244
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,120
of elements

245
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,160
uh

246
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,800
integral elements which have a

247
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,120
non-trivial evaluation only at the

248
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
primes in the set s

249
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,600
so at any primes on s it has valuation

250
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
zero

251
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
so if we want to recursively compute

252
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,040
this s unit group we can use the

253
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,600
normalization uh essentially directly we

254
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,760
can compute s units uh the s unit groups

255
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,000
of the sub fields and we can recombine

256
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,839
them based uh according to the

257
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,440
normalization where

258
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,519
here for example v is

259
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,480
uh

260
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,360
from uh given by the subfield has unit

261
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,000
groups and the ais are the exponents or

262
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,240
the coefficients of the normalization

263
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,720
um and this gives us a subgroup of the

264
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,839
same group specifically an index d

265
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,839
subgroup of the scna group we want the

266
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,279
whole thing so we need to do another

267
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,839
technique which we refer to as

268
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,880
saturation or desaturation

269
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,959
essentially saturation is to take

270
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,600
elements of v and search for products of

271
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,920
them which give you d it's powers

272
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,680
and then we want to take those ds roots

273
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,480
and

274
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,560
improve the index until we finally get

275
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,000
an index 1

276
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
suburb or the full s unit group

277
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and the downside of that is like i

278
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,079
mentioned in there is that taking those

279
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,480
death routes so again this is

280
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,880
normations one of the prices you pay is

281
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,519
taking roots sometimes

282
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,600
it's generally worth it

283
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,079
but there's also this an example from

284
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,760
bfhp

285
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,320
for example 5.3 they take they compute

286
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,839
the class group

287
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,920
of the psychoatomic field of conductor

288
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,320
6552

289
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,880
which has degree

290
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,160
1728 and they're able to compute the

291
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,880
class group in 4.2 hours without using s

292
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,040
units like we do here

293
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,959
um but one of the tricks that they use

294
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,279
is to

295
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,519
only compute the structure of the class

296
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,519
group so they don't compute generators

297
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,760
like we would be doing here

298
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,560
so

299
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,640
that is one of the uh

300
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,959
powerful things normalizations a

301
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,800
powerful thing you can do

302
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
if you only are interested in the

303
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,839
structure of a class group for example

304
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,959
so

305
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,560
one of the core

306
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,399
contributions we have here is ideal

307
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,560
decomposition so in the close principle

308
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,880
multiple algorithm that we introduced or

309
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,920
started with

310
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,440
there was an ideal decomposition step

311
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,959
that is expensive and it's one of the

312
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,079
reasons that that cdw relies on the

313
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,600
quantum algorithm for an efficient

314
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,120
reduction

315
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,440
uh and so we want to look at this under

316
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,680
the lens of a normalization and so we

317
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,000
take the obvious approach at first

318
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,320
decompose the relative norms themselves

319
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,760
in a subfield

320
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,720
so

321
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,600
uh and we can apply a normalization to

322
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,920
ideals just as well as to elements so we

323
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,839
have a relation like this on

324
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,680
our ideals

325
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,880
of okay

326
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,800
and if you want to decompose a we can

327
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,399
start by looking at this norm relation

328
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,160
and decomposing

329
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,000
these relative norms individually

330
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,560
and if we do that we can recover an

331
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,000
element alpha and

332
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,639
a

333
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,800
exponent vector uh giving us a

334
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,279
decomposition but like we said there's

335
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,040
that issue of the denominator so now we

336
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,600
have a decomposition of a to the d

337
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,360
uh instead of a

338
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,680
and it's not clear how you can go get

339
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,720
recover decomposition of a directly

340
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,160
because alpha may not be at d to the

341
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,880
power the y i's may not be divisible by

342
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,120
d and so we have to do quite a bit of

343
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,240
extra work

344
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,200
from there so to start with that

345
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,600
we compute generators of the sga group

346
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,000
and as well as a matrix whose rows are

347
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,079
the valuations of those generators over

348
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,760
the set s

349
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,120
this is a standard practice with

350
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,600
computing s unit groups and

351
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,680
if we do that then we can solve a

352
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,079
particular linear equation we can find a

353
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,240
vector x so that y equals x m mod d

354
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,320
uh and we use this because we can do

355
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
some transformations here so that in the

356
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,160
top left we have our

357
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,720
decomposition of a to the d um i'm not

358
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,760
going to go through all the steps here

359
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,560
of course but uh if we manipulate things

360
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,000
enough we are

361
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
left with uh what we see here in the

362
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,760
oh can't do that

363
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,040
in the very last line uh which is the we

364
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,120
have our alpha prime and we have a

365
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,680
product of delta j's a j and then we

366
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,399
have the product of the p i's to the d

367
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,760
times the i's so uh those that product

368
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,560
of prime ideals uh we're done with we've

369
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
gotten until we've gotten halfway there

370
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,079
because now the exponents are divisible

371
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,639
by d if you want to take d with roots we

372
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,320
can just divide that by d

373
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,000
uh we're left with this term in the

374
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,120
front that we need to figure out

375
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,920
something to do with um and just to note

376
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,600
that those um

377
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,199
the delta g's are products of our s unit

378
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,720
generators so they're actually s units

379
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,000
themselves

380
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,040
um and the alpha prime is just a generic

381
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,000
element

382
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,320
for all intents and purposes and the

383
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,880
ahas are just exponents that we we don't

384
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,959
know but we know that they must exist

385
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,079
because we know that we should have this

386
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,800
decomposition

387
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,320
and just to

388
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
mention that we are not evaluating these

389
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,480
products of elements here that you see

390
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,760
we keep everything in a product

391
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,000
representation uh the alpha primes and

392
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,440
the delta g's

393
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,600
um and we'll mention that in a moment

394
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,440
why we do that

395
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,519
but with this information we like we

396
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,880
said we have to figure out something to

397
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,199
do with the those terms at the front and

398
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,440
so we use a technique called the well

399
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,160
taking d of powers modulo s units so we

400
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,399
know out that alpha prime is a d of

401
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,040
power modulo so that set of s units the

402
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,279
delta 1 delta m

403
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,240
i either exist this these exponents aj

404
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,399
that give us this equation that there

405
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,639
should be some aj's so that

406
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,399
this product here

407
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,120
is a d of power or some some beta so we

408
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,360
can bring saturation back into the

409
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,639
picture

410
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,320
just like when we were computing s unit

411
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,279
groups we saturated the set v

412
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,920
here we can just saturate the set u we

413
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,760
just throw alpha prime into the mix and

414
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,959
we really don't have to do anything

415
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,920
special just reuse our saturation tools

416
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,000
um and when we do this we can find those

417
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,120
exponents aj's such that uh this thing

418
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,040
is a d the power

419
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,759
so now we have everything is

420
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,360
looks very nice and we can take g of

421
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,519
roots across the board

422
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,600
uh and we finally have our decomposition

423
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,639
of a

424
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,839
uh

425
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,240
over the pi's so there's a catch here

426
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,160
though uh which is that like we said

427
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,680
before that everything was in a product

428
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,680
representation so

429
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,440
we can't just take a root it's more

430
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,959
complicated than that

431
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,480
so what we have to do is use a technique

432
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,120
called compact representation

433
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,040
where we can sort of manipulate it so

434
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,279
that we only have to take a death root

435
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,560
of something that's reasonably small

436
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,639
and so this is an efficient technique

437
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,680
and

438
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
you'll see it

439
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,040
in this field

440
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,639
and so we take advantage of that and we

441
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,040
are able to take the root eventually and

442
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,839
recover this decomposition

443
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,160
with some of the applications of this

444
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,079
uh right away we can

445
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,120
talk about

446
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
the principle ideal problem so we can

447
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,480
decide whether or not an ideal is

448
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,800
principle using decompositions

449
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,839
so the idea is first to take a set s of

450
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,360
primes that generates a class group of

451
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,800
your field

452
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,240
um and we're assuming that we have a

453
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,680
normal relation so we can do all this

454
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,720
stuff

455
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,160
um and the

456
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,000
uh compute we can compute the s unit

457
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,519
group but we only need to do it once and

458
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,160
we can do this recursively

459
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,920
and then

460
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,000
if we want to determine if an ideal is

461
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,199
principle we can just take its

462
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,120
decomposition again recursively like we

463
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,399
just showed

464
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,000
and if it has a trivial decomposition

465
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,680
then it's principle

466
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,959
one thing that i

467
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,919
didn't mention earlier on uh was that

468
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,599
we're doing all these things recursively

469
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,119
in sub deals this is what can all be

470
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,640
done in parallel so that's also one of

471
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,559
the very powerful things of normal

472
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,919
nations

473
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,760
we can do this all separately or in

474
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,959
parallel

475
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,039
um and then we can also do a search pip

476
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,559
to find a generator for a principle

477
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,760
ideal

478
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,439
um it's a little bit more

479
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,319
involved and unfortunately it involves

480
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,200
computing an s unit group basically per

481
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,919
input so for each ideal that you want to

482
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,039
check

483
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,120
but it is a much smaller estimate group

484
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,960
um

485
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,360
much fewer primes in the estimate group

486
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,039
but it is possible and also can be done

487
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,520
recursively

488
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,880
uh for more applications getting to the

489
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
part that we were advertising

490
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,039
uh we can compute the minus part of the

491
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,799
class group

492
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,400
so we kind of mentioned earlier the

493
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,919
minus part of the class group is the

494
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,320
kernel of this relative norm map from k

495
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,480
to k plus

496
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,880
and so the idea to compute this

497
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,520
is if we have a set of generators s and

498
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,640
s prime

499
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,799
for the class groups of k and k plus

500
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,039
respectively

501
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,400
then we can decompose

502
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
the norms of the primes in s over the

503
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,320
primes in s prime

504
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,480
uh to get a description of the norm map

505
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,160
the relative norm map

506
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,080
um and there's a little bit i'm sweeping

507
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,120
under the rug with this like always but

508
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,880
we can essentially use some linear

509
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,919
algebra

510
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,600
compute the kernel this relative norm

511
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,520
map and we can recover the minus part of

512
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,160
the class group

513
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,559
and

514
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,200
we can also verify some an assumption of

515
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,440
the cdw paper so this is

516
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,520
uh an assumption that the close

517
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,280
principal multiple algorithm relies on

518
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,480
and it is the

519
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,919
assumption that the minus part of the

520
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,039
class verb

521
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,160
is generated by few ideals of small norm

522
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,400
and their conjugates with probability

523
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,440
one-half

524
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,600
um so we were we have all the tools to

525
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,520
do this we can compute the minus part we

526
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,760
can

527
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,080
try drawing

528
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,640
prima deals at random um

529
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,080
that satisfy this and check this

530
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,400
probability and we do that we have some

531
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,600
uh

532
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,240
information on that at the end

533
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
so we can also do what we

534
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,919
advertise from the beginning which is

535
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,480
compute mildly short vectors find mildly

536
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,600
short vectors

537
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,640
so

538
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,960
it's not too complicated to do that from

539
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,919
here

540
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,480
if you recall the cdw process just

541
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,160
use the close principle multiple

542
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,240
technique as well as the existing

543
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,720
techniques for finding a short generator

544
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,160
of a principle ideal

545
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,080
so we can

546
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,600
take this close principle multiple

547
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,919
algorithm and that decomposition step

548
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,240
that was expensive and required a

549
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,480
quantum algorithm in order to be

550
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,679
efficient

551
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,760
we can use our normalization variant

552
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,840
that does this recursive

553
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,959
decomposition instead

554
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,400
and so as far as the complexity goes

555
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,159
everything is determined by the

556
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,440
subfields so

557
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,200
up to polynomial factors the search for

558
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,960
mildly short vectors is totally

559
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
determined by the subfield s unit group

560
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,440
and ideal decomposition costs

561
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,960
um

562
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,080
in

563
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,200
if you remember when i mentioned the

564
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,440
lambda function earlier uh this is the

565
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,679
size of the largest the degree of the

566
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,919
largest subfield in the normalization

567
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,679
uh in the case that

568
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,480
lambda of m to that degree is less than

569
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,280
uh the degree of the field itself to the

570
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,840
a where a is less than three-fourths

571
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,520
we have a super polynomial improvement

572
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,320
over the bkz algorithm uh which

573
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,400
finds a mildly short vector in time to

574
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,320
the o till the square root n

575
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,679
um

576
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,080
and the bkz algorithm is in general

577
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,520
ideals just sorry general lattices

578
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,679
the state-of-the-art for finding

579
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,799
if you wanted to find a model of the

580
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,280
short vector so we can outperform

581
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,559
bkz in these cases

582
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,000
and we also show an

583
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,159
infinite family of fields where the cost

584
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,000
is in fact uh

585
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,480
this i won't say out loud but

586
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,480
uh it is essentially uh this complexity

587
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,559
2 to the n to the little of one in this

588
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,320
particular family field

589
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,679
and i just want to emphasize though that

590
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,039
this is a very

591
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,320
narrow range of fields that satisfy this

592
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
but we do get a very big improvement

593
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,679
over bkz

594
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,600
uh asymptotically

595
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,399
in this family

596
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,880
and so this is a bit more information on

597
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,159
the the

598
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,760
how often you can expect a fine field

599
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,440
set where you can get this sort of

600
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,919
improvement so the rightmost column

601
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,440
there is the

602
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,480
probability of finding a field

603
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,240
where we have that the degree of the

604
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,200
largest subfield is less than the degree

605
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,640
of the fields at three-fourths where

606
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
like we said we have a super polynomial

607
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,559
improvement over bkz

608
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,440
up to

609
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,240
1000 for example uh 30 percent of fields

610
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,919
admit a normalization that allows us to

611
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:02,960
do this

612
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,799
um and that's how you can

613
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,679
continue to read this the uh

614
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,440
as you as you try to

615
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,799
restrict the degree of the subfields

616
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,960
more and more and get them to be smaller

617
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,799
and smaller you can see that the

618
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,720
probability of finding a normalization

619
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,480
or field that has such a normalization

620
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,840
gets very small

621
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,720
and i briefly mentioned that we can work

622
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,080
on uh or we can verify this assumption

623
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,919
or compute some evidence for this

624
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,880
assumption from cdw uh

625
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,559
about the minus part of class group

626
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,640
being generated by very few prime ideals

627
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,120
a small norm and so we did run some

628
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,799
experiments on this because uh just

629
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,880
about everything we talked about here is

630
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,159
implemented

631
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,960
um and this is the results of some

632
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,760
experiments um we were able to do

633
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,880
for example the first line uh sample d

634
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,960
three i deals at random or norm less

635
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,520
than b i've had probability of eighty

636
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,039
seven percent of generating the minus

637
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,640
part of the class group over a hundred

638
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,559
iterations

639
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,879
um

640
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,240
there we go and that's it

641
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,360
thank you

642
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,590
thank you william

643
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:19,120
[Applause]

644
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,400
if you have a question for william

645
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,799
please use the microphones come up in

646
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,760
microphone yes

647
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,760
yeah i might have a question so if i

648
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,480
understood it correctly you decontour is

649
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,400
the karma and

650
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
puka and vesolovsky

651
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,520
algorithm by replacing the quantum part

652
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,960
by some classical part so now it's fully

653
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,279
classical

654
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,640
yeah

655
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,039
yes it's not we don't get the same

656
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,200
efficient reduction that

657
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,279
we would have with the quantum

658
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,880
algorithm but we get something which

659
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,720
like in that very narrow family of

660
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
fields that we showed is very close to

661
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,919
being

662
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,400
very close to being polynomial but not

663
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,799
as efficient though

664
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,039
okay so yeah okay that was i was

665
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,520
wondering so it's on the trade-off of

666
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,200
only being efficient on very specific

667
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,400
fields

668
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,760
right and still not reaching a

669
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,640
polynomial complexity for that reduction

670
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,320
okay thanks for clarifying

671
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,799
we have more questions or perhaps

672
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,360
questions from zoom you can

673
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,240
directly unmute yourselves

674
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,039
it looks like there's no more questions

675
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,960
so please let's thank william again

676
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,019
[Applause]
