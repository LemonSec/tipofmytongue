1
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:07,010
Thank You bad for the introduction so

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,639
this talk is about constructing

3
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:12,199
authenticated encryption schemes from

4
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:13,940
trickable brookside so let me first give

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,250
you the context of this talk of his work

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,410
so the static starting point is the

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,230
ongoing Caesar competition for

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,210
authenticated encryption and more

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,180
precisely the three candidates geox is

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,670
Georgia can castle by the same team of

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,280
designers jenny.zhang mission college

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,890
and tomorrow and each of these

13
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,350
candidates is based on a dedicated

14
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,770
tweakable block cipher and two specific

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,530
modes of operation so the first one for

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,540
the nonce respecting setting which means

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,610
if you're not afraid that not will be

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,910
repeated you can use this mod which was

19
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,070
remote which was chosen was receiving

20
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,470
well the generic violent of with ocb

21
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,460
she's called TDI CB and for the nonce

22
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,800
peaceful setting they used a mode which

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,110
is called coba which has been designed

24
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,259
by andré Villa and there were some

25
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:08,869
problems with copper first it provides

26
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,539
only what is called online not misuse

27
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,670
resistance so I will not enter into the

28
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,619
details of what it is but this is not

29
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:18,439
the strongest nonce misuse resistant yet

30
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:22,299
that you can help and in bad caracas his

31
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:24,109
security definition is a bit

32
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:27,590
controversial so it has been some

33
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,749
problems also with some technique which

34
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:32,630
is called xls with copper used to to be

35
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,819
based on so which has been broken by

36
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:37,189
Nnanji so it has been fixed but still

37
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:39,950
there is diversity program of online us

38
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,659
bishops resistance and the designers

39
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:47,119
wanted to so find a new new mode so what

40
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,749
were the the requirements for for the

41
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:52,880
mode so first it had to be based on a

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,399
tricky bird rock cycle it has to offer

43
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:59,810
some fool what I could fully is the

44
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,560
strongest possible not misuse resistance

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,329
security notion possible at least up to

46
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:08,090
the birthday bound and if possible

47
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,818
to get beyond that the band security in

48
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:12,950
the nonce respecting setting so the

49
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,920
rationale behind that is that if you if

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,310
you use your your your mod without

51
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,470
repeat with repeating nonces you should

52
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,569
be able to use this property to to get

53
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:25,519
beyond both the resistance beyond

54
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,590
birthday band resistance and in case

55
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,780
something goes wrong with insist you

56
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,299
still retain some weaker weaker bound

57
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:34,610
but still a good bound to the reverse

58
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,730
alarm and if you look at existing mode

59
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,650
for turning a trick ever book satellite

60
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,849
into an authenticated encryption scheme

61
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:46,880
none of this mod satisfy these two

62
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,950
requirements at the same time so we have

63
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,590
to deci be which is perfectly secure

64
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,680
when knowns are not repeated which risk

65
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,049
which is completely insecure progress is

66
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:59,090
completely broken as soon as a single

67
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,379
knowns is reused once so there were

68
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,090
scope Abbott as I said it only provides

69
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,400
online not misuse resistance which is

70
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,730
not the strongest form we can helpful so

71
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,709
there is the candidate I easy which you

72
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,870
can recast as turning a trigger box

73
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,389
either into something even stronger than

74
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:22,609
unknowns misuse basis on schema name it

75
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:25,280
offers what is called robustness but

76
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,819
only in the only approved birthday bound

77
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:31,130
even when the nonce does not repeat and

78
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,480
finally there is a mode called protected

79
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,139
ID PIV so the problem with this mode so

80
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,090
it it achieved these two properties at

81
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,290
the same time that the problem is that

82
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,560
it requires a very long three clamps

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,000
which was not possible with deoxys and

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,190
jerky so the trick ever work suffers dog

85
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,560
this idiotic they have short quick short

86
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,200
weeks or the same size as the block size

87
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,349
and so please mod was not adequate for

88
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:01,819
for our goal so what we came with is a

89
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:04,069
new mode which is called SVG for

90
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,410
synthetic content week and this is a

91
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,730
month that i will dis right now so the

92
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,799
outline will be as follows so we use

93
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,510
generate composition so first i will

94
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,488
introduce the new a generic composition

95
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:16,790
met

96
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,680
that we use which is called n s IV and

97
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,260
which is very close to s ID and then I

98
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,470
will describe the two parts of the mod

99
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,700
the authentication part and the

100
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,660
encryption part so first some quick

101
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,480
definitions about to cable box hackers

102
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,880
and authenticated encryption so the

103
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,500
building block of foam which we are

104
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,180
starting is a true cable box after so

105
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,430
which is quite similar to a standard box

106
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,650
either so it takes a plaintext x + gk

107
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,230
but it takes also an additional input

108
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,940
which is correct week and which is here

109
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,830
to bring by ability to the block cipher

110
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,380
and the twitch is a typically assume

111
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,630
public or even control by the adversary

112
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,360
and from a security point of view each

113
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,370
trick should give a kind of an

114
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,550
independent permutation so you can turn

115
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,530
the are generic ways to turn a block

116
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,930
cipher into a kookaburra book cycle but

117
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,610
usually the security is only up to the

118
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,980
birthday bound for example here the XEX

119
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,090
construction and they are very few block

120
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,800
ciphers which has been which I've been

121
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,690
designed natively to be trickable so

122
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,690
there has been some early designs such

123
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,630
as has deepening cipher mercy three fish

124
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,060
which is the underlying the hash

125
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,520
function skin and since this is a

126
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,190
competition they have been more and more

127
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:38,240
designs of this kind of primitive so in

128
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,010
that garage just who do kiss advantage

129
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,650
but also in scream and ice cream and in

130
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,220
n alpha so this is our building block

131
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,950
and what we want to construct is what is

132
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,780
called unknowns based authenticated

133
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,280
encryption scheme and so what is this

134
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,990
scheme so it's a scheme which takes

135
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,040
actually unknowns n some associated data

136
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,050
which will only be authenticated not

137
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,810
encrypted and a message a which will be

138
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,600
encrypted and it returns a cycle taxi ok

139
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,780
and the decryption algorithm takes the

140
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,030
nonce the associated data and the cipher

141
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,880
and we turns either a message or some

142
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,370
symbol which indicates that the cipher

143
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,330
is in value ok and so typically the

144
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,920
nones should not be repeated but

145
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,630
time this is something that you cannot

146
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,340
assume so just one slide about how do

147
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,620
you define the security of such a scheme

148
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,200
so you consider an adversary which has

149
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,720
access to tools and encryption about her

150
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,520
in a decryption of occur and please

151
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,330
advise we must distinguish two worlds

152
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,160
the world where it has access to the

153
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,110
radar accounts and the world where it as

154
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,810
access to so the encryption of a girl is

155
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,300
replaced by something which returns

156
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,950
purely random bits of the adequate

157
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,380
length and the decryption or a girl is

158
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,700
replaced by something which always

159
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,810
reject ok and so we will say that the

160
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,090
adversary is not respecting if it never

161
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,460
repeats in ohms here in an encryption

162
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,860
cravat so what we want to achieve

163
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,350
typically in such schemes it what we

164
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,970
call not misuse resistance which

165
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,650
informally means that even if a nonce is

166
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,350
repeated in encryption Kirby's first it

167
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,020
should not harm authenticity and it

168
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,290
should hurt confidentiality only insofar

169
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,930
as a repetition of triplets n-am are

170
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,600
detectable so this is unavailable but we

171
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,930
see the only think that the only bad

172
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,600
thing that we want to happen so in fact

173
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,430
this is quite close to what's called

174
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,350
deterministic authenticated encryption

175
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:51,000
and notice that such schemes cannot be

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,910
online right because if you think about

177
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,800
it it's easy to see that each side a

178
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,010
text much much depend on every input bit

179
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,440
so you can do this you cannot achieve

180
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,660
the security nation with an online

181
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,820
scheme so now I will explain the

182
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,890
generate composition method that we use

183
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,790
in this news in this new mod which is

184
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,760
called nhie so generic composition

185
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,900
is just a way of taking my mac or a PRF

186
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,570
and an encryption scheme and to combine

187
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,420
them to obtain a nonce bay in on-base

188
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,550
authenticated and Richards encryption

189
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,950
schemes so you can encrypt Denmark and

190
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,909
quick n mark and so on and so forth and

191
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,520
before I go further it's important to to

192
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,070
have in mind that the syntax of the

193
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,870
encryption scheme is very important so

194
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,170
and in the one you had mainly two types

195
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,150
of encryption schemes we have what is

196
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,920
called i debase and quicker'n schemes

197
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,230
where the encryption function randomly

198
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,790
chooses andum IV for each encryption for

199
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,910
example in the CBC encryption and you

200
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,110
have what is called nonce based

201
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,170
encryption where the encryption scheme

202
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,570
takes an ounce which in the security

203
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,460
definition is chosen by the adversary

204
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,770
but should be non-repeating so for

205
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,560
example you have what we could you could

206
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,540
call nonce based controller which is

207
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,840
used for example in GCM and this is very

208
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,400
important what this in mind when you

209
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,360
consider generate composition so our

210
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,310
starting point was a mode which is

211
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,380
called SIV which has been proposed by

212
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,610
our way and fronting and which allows to

213
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,830
build a nonce miss Ruth misuse resistant

214
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,070
scheme so how does it work so you have a

215
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,860
PRF and an engine encryption scheme and

216
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,310
you first give you unknowns you're

217
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,750
associated data in your message to your

218
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,310
pseudo random function and please give

219
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,370
you a tag which will be used for a tent

220
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,480
city and this tag here will be converted

221
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,670
well you can forget about conversion you

222
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,770
can just usually take the tag and use it

223
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,580
at the ivy for an IV base encryption

224
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,740
scheme ok and you encrypt your message

225
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,890
with with your tag as I ok and please

226
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,940
give you your circle text so this SIV

227
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,680
construction get provides you in on

228
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,720
Smith use resistance up to the birthday

229
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,030
bound if you instantiate your salon

230
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,940
function a new encryption scheme with

231
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,160
birthday bound secure

232
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,590
constructions okay so it's a good

233
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,570
setting point but what if you want to

234
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,030
add beyond the sea bound security in the

235
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,760
nonce respecting case well actually for

236
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,730
the PRF it's it's quite easy in fact I

237
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,130
will explain in a few minutes out but

238
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,660
the main difficulty is how to obtain an

239
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,640
encryption scheme which is beyond

240
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,560
birthday bound secure when Nazis don't

241
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,540
repeat and actually if you think of it

242
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,330
what is hard is that the encryption

243
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,520
scheme doesn't take the nonce as input

244
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,540
so our only modification to SIV is to

245
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,760
reuse the nonce in the encryption scheme

246
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,340
right and will be used so we will be

247
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,680
able to to leverage on the non-repeating

248
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,150
perpetual announced to build an

249
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,420
unintentional so if you look now closer

250
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,360
at the encryption scheme now it's a bit

251
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,600
weird why because it takes both unknowns

252
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,260
and a random IV right which is quite

253
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,690
unusual and i actually i did not know

254
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,250
any encryption scheme which is built

255
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,890
like this for taking unknowns and random

256
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,430
a but actually it's quite easy to come

257
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,960
with a security definition for such a

258
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,840
scheme right cycle text must be in this

259
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,550
vision blurry from random assuming known

260
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,530
to not repeat and assuming the IV's

261
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:47,090
around online and actually when nan says

262
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,640
can can be repeated you recover the

263
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,620
standard notion of IV based encryption

264
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,130
or honest and so what is nice with this

265
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,420
construction is that you can prove that

266
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,420
if you're all your components are beyond

267
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,210
the stay secure when Nazis do not repeat

268
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,880
then you are you're authenticated

269
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,590
encryption scheme is beyond the secure

270
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,810
when one sees do not repeat and when one

271
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,810
sees drew a bit you get the security of

272
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,770
your two components when one sees it so

273
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,020
what what what we have to do now from

274
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,510
his generate composition method is to

275
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,960
build to our two components here so

276
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,200
first a PRF which is be secure when when

277
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,730
Don sees do not repeat and which is

278
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,590
secure up to the birthday bond when

279
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,840
Nancy's do a bit and an encryption

280
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,130
scheme which with the same

281
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:41,300
that is right so for the authentic

282
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,730
authentication part we design something

283
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,490
that we call encrypted parallel beckman

284
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,830
kappa so i will not spend too much time

285
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:53,600
on this on this design because this will

286
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,330
be the main topic of my this kind of

287
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,950
design will be the mentor because of the

288
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,080
savant or i will give in this session so

289
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,650
just to give you a very small idea of

290
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,410
what is going on in fact we first we

291
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,160
design a PRF of the nonce by withering

292
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,500
two independent permutations of the

293
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,960
notes please give us a beyond does they

294
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,460
secure PRF then we accelerate with some

295
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,250
kind of hash of the message some kind of

296
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,280
so this hash is very similar to what is

297
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,100
only in the pmac scheme so call it p

298
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,870
hash or the associated data and the

299
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,500
message so raphy is this part here gives

300
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,220
you a kind of vague mankatha match right

301
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,720
so this is secure beyond the birthday

302
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,090
bound when Nazis do not repeat and to

303
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,020
get non Smith use resistance we add an

304
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,180
extra encryption I are at the end okay

305
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,780
so I'm not entering into details and we

306
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,080
give more details later and so you can

307
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,480
prove that this design here is secure

308
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,340
beyond the birthday bound when Nancy's

309
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,470
do not repeat and up to the birthday

310
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,460
bound when Nancy stupid okay so the so

311
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,130
this was not so much innovative in fact

312
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,860
we just gather known techniques and

313
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,800
known schemes the what is more

314
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,010
interesting is how to design the

315
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,380
encryption part so this is what I will

316
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,490
explain now so we we explored many

317
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,980
design possibilities and we found out

318
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,830
that what was more convenient what to

319
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,800
start from a control each pod so a

320
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,140
control like might just mean that we we

321
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,000
do something with our trickable block

322
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,520
cipher which gives us a mask and we just

323
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,950
pick saw this mask with the message

324
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,560
rocks to give us

325
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,370
text okay so now the question is how do

326
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,060
we what do we give as inputs to our

327
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,590
trickable work later okay we have

328
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:55,420
unknowns we have an IV this IV will be

329
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,750
the starting value for the counters so

330
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,430
traditionally when you do a control mode

331
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,890
encryption you give the counters with

332
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,860
the initial value ie as input to the

333
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,610
message back of your block cipher right

334
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,890
so what we could do is so we still have

335
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,930
the tweak tweak input of the block

336
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,820
cipher what we could do is put the nonce

337
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,330
in the tweaking boot right the problem

338
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,570
is if we do that we don't have beyond

339
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,850
batleybound security even when Nancy's

340
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,740
do not repeat right because the others

341
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,500
we can simply do one curry with one

342
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,589
specific notes of sight of length 2 to

343
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:36,130
the N over 2 message blocks and here you

344
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,800
can just look for collision in the XOR

345
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,360
of the message box and the sack attack

346
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,390
blocks okay and please since the st.

347
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,030
weeks the same trick enters alway the

348
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,040
table that we have the two cable block

349
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,690
data we always have the same permutation

350
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,500
and so this will be distinguishable from

351
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,240
random because we won't see any

352
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,200
collision in the extra of messages and

353
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,210
cycle text okay so this does not work

354
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,790
and the simple idea to make it work is

355
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,240
just to switch the input to that this

356
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,730
means to encrypt the nuns and to put the

357
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,100
contours in the trick input of the two

358
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,470
cable block cipher okay and this is why

359
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,230
we call it a continent which encryption

360
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,410
money and the key observation here is

361
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,720
that when you do a controller the

362
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,200
encryption you want the mapping from the

363
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,959
counters to the to the masks to be a

364
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,089
function not a permutation because being

365
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:33,040
a permutation is exactly the property

366
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,410
that allows you to distinguish your

367
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,470
cipher text from on them okay and if we

368
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,720
put the counters in the tweak input well

369
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,540
the simple observation is that for an

370
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,060
ideal tweakable block cipher the mapping

371
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,730
from the trick to the cycle text is a

372
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,370
function it's not it has no reason to be

373
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,020
right so this is our design for for the

374
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,920
encryption part so let me just give you

375
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,350
a few I user for you prove that you Atia

376
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,619
of this construction in the first exam

377
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:10,510
so yeah further bound so so it's a bit

378
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,720
complicated but also n here if the block

379
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,220
length subnet to give a buceta see the

380
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,859
three clanks Sigma is the total number

381
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:21,309
of blocks in encryption queries and and

382
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:23,589
if the maximum number of non repetitions

383
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,199
so N equals one in the nonce respecting

384
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:28,809
setting yep so what we can see Percy

385
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:31,360
that when Nazis do not repeat this term

386
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,630
here vanishes and we we are left with

387
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,470
them which show that it is secure up to

388
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,010
the minimum of 2 to the n n n blocks and

389
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,400
2 to the n plus T blogs and 2 to the n

390
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,090
plus T other two blocks so assuming the

391
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,670
three clangs is big enough this is

392
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,059
beyond body secure and another

393
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:58,059
interesting property that security

394
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,130
degrades gracefully with maximum number

395
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,110
of nodes repetitions which means that if

396
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,210
you only only have two or three nodes

397
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,610
repetitions this term here it will

398
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,620
remain small ok you really have to

399
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,240
repeat not a lot of time to get a large

400
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,360
tail here ok but really I think it's an

401
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,790
interesting property of this asking so

402
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,580
how do you prove this bound so first

403
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,890
assume that the adversary never will be

404
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,860
Nazis in encryption keys and we want to

405
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,390
show that cycle text here are

406
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:34,630
indisputable for Amanda so so HIV so

407
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,850
each initial value here will determine

408
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,860
the seconds of tweaks which are used in

409
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,000
the GBC and an important parameter will

410
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,520
be for each tweak what I call the load

411
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,260
of the twix which is the number of time

412
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,800
the trick has been used throughout all

413
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,050
encryption queries ok and actually it's

414
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,640
quite easy to see that if you think

415
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,950
about what a trigger box icon is

416
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,010
actually it's easy to see that it is

417
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,760
really equivalent to trying to

418
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,570
wish each permutation associated to each

419
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,050
trick from a function so actually you

420
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,360
can prove that the advantage of the

421
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,610
adversary is upper bounded by the sum of

422
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,700
all the PRF PRP advantages for each

423
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,130
tweak with a number of queries which

424
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,170
ways which is equal to the number of

425
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,820
times to what I call the roll of the

426
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,290
twig which is the number of times the

427
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,140
trick has been used in the encryption

428
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,110
codes so now we have to just upper bound

429
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,260
is the maximum value of the of the load

430
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,180
of the trick and actually it's easy to

431
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,490
see that it is a simple balls into bins

432
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,850
problem you can think of each tweet

433
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,280
value as a bin and you can think of the

434
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,250
non sees as as the boars and for each

435
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,430
query the random IV which is chosen by

436
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,830
the encryption orica will determine in

437
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,710
which green I I start and then I put my

438
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,040
my board in the consecutive beans

439
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,380
according to the counters ok and so for

440
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,660
each nuns I will choose a random of

441
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,680
starting bin and put my my balls into it

442
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,350
ok and so this is not exactly a

443
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,150
classical boys into this program because

444
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,210
you you put usually you would put your

445
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,180
board independent here in the in the in

446
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,610
the bins but it's it's easy to see that

447
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,610
putting the balls in consecutive means

448
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,020
cannot help in fact in increasing the

449
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,860
maximum load of all the beans so

450
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,990
actually standard stronger bounds on

451
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,900
this program apply and this gives us the

452
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,500
final bound for the Contra for the photo

453
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,210
and secretive I will skip the what

454
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,190
happens in when Nancy's can can be

455
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,960
reused but it's quite easy to see that

456
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,480
you will have a problem only when the

457
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,170
same notes is we use twice for the same

458
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,450
tweak and it is it with you that it

459
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,610
gives you this parameter here in the

460
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,590
security bond which vanishes when

461
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:06,200
Nancy's cannot repeat so to computer

462
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,000
so I describe an authentication mode

463
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,920
encryption mud if when you combine these

464
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,490
two months using the NS IV composition

465
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,660
with method you get what we call the HCG

466
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,370
mods or synthetic control and twix so

467
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:25,130
synthetic here recalls from the edge

468
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,910
comes from the S IV mod okay because the

469
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:32,660
initial contour is computed as a PRF of

470
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,420
the nones the meds agent and the

471
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,600
associated data and so as I explained

472
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,240
this mod is beyond birthday secure when

473
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,460
Don sees do not repeat and it retains

474
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,770
does the one security in the non Smith

475
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,670
you sitting so actually it's it's quite

476
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,110
efficient so it's not online that you

477
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,380
cannot achieve this you should not miss

478
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,230
U's resistant online it's easy to

479
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,300
paralyze and it does not need the

480
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,490
decryption direction so it was quite

481
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,510
good so the final caveat is that about

482
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,310
instantiating the two cable box after if

483
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,250
you want to get beyond birthday security

484
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,560
when Nazis do not repeat you really need

485
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,900
to instantiate your blog site you go to

486
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,370
cable box either which something which

487
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,770
is beyond birthday secure which means

488
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,230
that you cannot use for example the

489
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,160
standard XD X generic construction can

490
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,090
you really need to use it ideally some

491
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,070
dedicated tweakable block cipher without

492
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,830
any known weakness so for example with

493
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,540
the exists and shortage it's ok because

494
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,180
these black cycles and these two cable

495
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,740
block ciphers have not been attacked now

496
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,440
