1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,279
and in this talk what we try to do is to

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:13,760
visit so and to to give and you are a

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,820
new bishop to a property distinguishing

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,120
property that was introduced last year

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,150
by using que todo and Europe 2015 and in

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,420
Prescott and the division property yeah

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,920
so the general setting so were

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,890
interested in invoke Cyprus and a

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,539
particular cryptanalysis of book ciphers

10
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:44,899
so so in general when an attacker wants

11
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:47,989
to to break a fiber I think first thing

12
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:49,700
that he will try to do is to find a

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,710
distinguishing property that should hold

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,399
for every value of the secret key K okay

15
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,050
along with the distinguishing properties

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,910
phantoms you can probably try to mount a

17
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,670
key recovery attack to find the value

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,280
whose secret key or part of it but in

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,439
this talk will all be only be interested

20
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,850
in there is distinguishing to how to

21
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,829
find a secrecy property for our blog

22
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:16,039
site so last year you look at other

23
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,499
presents it introduced a new

24
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:20,299
distinguishing property that he called

25
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:23,240
the division property and in some way

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,529
this can be seen as a generalization of

27
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:29,659
integral and higher order differential

28
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,509
distinguishes so he managed in

29
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,240
particular by using this to break to

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,979
fully break full miss you want for the

31
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,319
first step and this is was a best paper

32
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,909
Awards at last

33
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:46,579
last year Krypton so I was try to

34
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:47,959
explain a little bit what is the

35
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,329
division property but before this I will

36
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:53,509
introduce notation watch a movie so the

37
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,849
person the person patient is the way I

38
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,959
will represent

39
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,859
monomials of and variables so imagine

40
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:03,829
you have two vectors 2 n-bit vectors x

41
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:07,579
and y i will denote by X to the power of

42
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:10,580
Y the product coordinate my coordinate

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,820
of X I to the power you I or excite and

44
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,960
you I are the Gordon

45
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,510
the vectors x and y so let's say this

46
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,410
with an example imagine you have you

47
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:27,110
inst vector 1 0 1 0 so x ^ you will be

48
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,860
so the the coordinate explorer ^ 1 the

49
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,640
coordinate X 3 to the power of of 0 the

50
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,140
cordilla makes 2 to the power 1 and

51
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,990
coordinate X 1 to the power of 0 when we

52
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,430
have a coordinate to the power of 0

53
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,130
actually this always will give 1 so we

54
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,560
don't care about these positions so this

55
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,820
will give the monomial X 4 X 2 then

56
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,010
imagine we want to evaluate this mu mu

57
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,920
mu so at the point let's say X it goes

58
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,260
to one month zero zero and what we will

59
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,420
get is so we'll compute 1 to the power 1

60
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,200
1 to the power of 0 times 0 to the power

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,390
1 times 0 to the power 0

62
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,310
and actually this these products always

63
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,130
almost always give 1 only and you could

64
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,440
have 0 only in the case when the base is

65
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,130
0 and the exponent is 1 so what we can

66
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,460
say that from this if we evaluate a

67
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,630
monomial we say that it will be 1 if and

68
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,100
only if the we avoid the situation where

69
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,890
we have 0 in the best and an exponent 1

70
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,640
which means that we'll have the Sun will

71
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,760
be a particle because one even only if

72
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,700
all the coordinates of you are strictly

73
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,990
smaller or equal to the requests for me

74
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,840
coordinates of X and this is so is the

75
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,330
partial order and so when I would say U

76
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,020
is smaller or equal to X I will use this

77
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,720
I will mean in this sense and I will use

78
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,560
this specialization okay so what is the

79
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,350
division property and actually if you

80
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,570
have a set of elements in there 2 to the

81
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,230
N we will say that the set X has no

82
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,140
division property of order K and we will

83
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,760
denote by D and K if the Sun when we

84
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,330
take sum over all elements in X of X to

85
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,050
the use of this marami

86
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,540
is zero for all vectors you that have a

87
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,970
common way that is strictly less than K

88
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,310
so it'd be covered we say that our set

89
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,050
has a revision property the opera key so

90
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,520
the division property is a kind of

91
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,210
generalization of integral properties

92
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,010
because for some particular values of K

93
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:54,900
we will get we get some very well-known

94
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,720
and integral properties for example it

95
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,150
is easy to see that when we have K is

96
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,050
equal to 2 if a set has revealed over G

97
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,419
of order to then actually it has the

98
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,850
balance property and when it has a

99
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,880
dividual property of maximal order then

100
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,710
it has saturated property that means

101
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,419
that all the values and assets are taken

102
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,700
exactly exactly month however the

103
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,370
novelty and this the division property

104
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,800
is an introduction of this intermediate

105
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,930
properties that means properties for

106
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,490
case that are between 3 and an M minus 1

107
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,830
so there is not very nice don't have as

108
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,270
an interpretation of this intermediate

109
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,820
properties however we can propagate them

110
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,160
and get some information and choose from

111
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,840
information about the algebraic degree

112
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,070
and so to construct distinguishes so

113
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,120
this will be the the outline of my talk

114
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,740
I will start by introducing so the main

115
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,690
notion of this paper that is the part

116
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,000
you set of assets I will show how is it

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
linked to an individual property and how

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,919
we can use it to get a very nice

119
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,440
description and either description about

120
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,169
such having the division property

121
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:07,680
actually of any order then I will show

122
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,830
how we can use this property to

123
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,180
construct distinguishes

124
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,430
for iterative block ciphers based on the

125
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,229
SPN construction and finally I will show

126
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:21,450
an application with some shallow day to

127
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,820
distinguish on the lightweight blocks

128
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,050
have a presence okay so what is a parity

129
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,599
set of a set so the notion is very easy

130
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,420
actually it is exactly the set

131
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,580
that is composed of all exponents you

132
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,390
such that the Sun when we checked sum

133
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,330
over all elements X of the monomial X to

134
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,630
the power of U is 1 so this actually

135
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,670
this sum can be 0 1 so you put in this

136
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,010
and set all the exponents that makes it

137
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,050
a sum is 1 and this will be the party

138
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,390
set of X ok so what is nice first thing

139
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,190
is that you can cook you can compute the

140
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,250
party set up I said very easily so to do

141
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,530
so I will read the notion of the

142
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,200
incident lecture of a set so they say

143
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,380
this vector of percepts or in altitude

144
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,810
en is just a vector binary vector

145
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,720
applying to to to to VN that has one are

146
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,450
to the positions for which X is in

147
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,640
effect so let's do this with an example

148
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,580
for example let's say an 8 equal to 3

149
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,220
and here under such X is composed of

150
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,880
three elements 1 4 and 7 then the

151
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,970
incidence lecture will be a vector of

152
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,940
length 8 of Hamming weight 3 that was

153
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,490
half I want exactly the positions were

154
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,710
corresponding to the element in the set

155
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,680
consider now a binary might matrix with

156
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,700
2 to the M rows and to the M columns

157
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,610
where the coefficient of intersection of

158
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,210
Rho U and column a will be a devaluation

159
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,160
of the monomial 8 to 8 you okay and what

160
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,520
we can actually show quite easily by

161
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,530
just taking the different operations

162
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,380
writing them down if that's if you want

163
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,840
to obtain there isn't a vector of the

164
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,030
parity set of a set you actually just

165
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,980
take various matter of a set and you

166
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,060
multiplied by this this matrix G okay

167
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,180
just an example so here n is equal to 3

168
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,659
and here if the magistrate corresponding

169
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:40,659
to this n so are the columns are are

170
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:43,120
fixed so the goal corresponds to the

171
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,800
basis and the rows correspond to a

172
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,230
clique

173
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,780
bounine so if you do this commutation

174
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,000
you obtain this minor a mattress that is

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,190
upper triangular and let's say your set

176
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,400
X is 1 2 and 4 and pre-op or you compute

177
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,040
a better defector you multiply them and

178
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,110
what your pain will be there to the

179
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,330
lectures of the parasites course for the

180
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,630
Paradiso so fun defined in the part and

181
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,690
the part is that opposite actually it's

182
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,240
very easy and what is nice about this I

183
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,440
what who will see it's that actually the

184
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,270
part is that if a set is unique

185
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,320
so there is one to one correspondence

186
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,130
between a set and at paralysis and for

187
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,630
this I am I will reach the notion of

188
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,430
operate Mueller codes so a reed-muller

189
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,430
code of length 2 to the N and order a

190
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,540
are it's just the set of all

191
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,570
manufacturers of all boolean functions

192
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,000
that have degree that istrict less or

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,840
equal to R and if you look a little

194
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,670
familiar familiar with Reggie Miller

195
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,350
code and you look at this matrix

196
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,900
actually you will immediately see that

197
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,290
this magic is a generation magic operate

198
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,990
Miller code of length 2 to the N and

199
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,510
order in and so what is nice about this

200
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,910
is that we know that this matrix has

201
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,580
full rank it's invertible and that is

202
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,900
inverse it's the matrix itself okay so

203
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,800
in veloute and exactly from this what we

204
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,100
see now that because of this we have an

205
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,260
isomorphism of binary vectors that much

206
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,310
incidence nature of a set of the

207
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,250
incidence vector of the the parity set

208
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,690
so which proves that for each subset you

209
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,710
there is a unique X subject X such that

210
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,740
you in the parties of X and you can go

211
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,440
backwards so yes

212
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,280
so there is a one-to-one correspondence

213
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,500
okay so what is now willing of this

214
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,820
party set and the division poppers so

215
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,560
actually it's easy to see that if you

216
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,600
have a set X that fulfill the division

217
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,300
property of program okay this just means

218
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,680
that as a party set all the elements in

219
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,030
the parties that will have a heavyweight

220
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,510
that will be greater or equal to K which

221
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,140
means that the division property of

222
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,900
order K is just a lower bound on the

223
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,100
weight of the elements in in the

224
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,410
parasite so here what we will try to do

225
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,670
so instead we'll see action to propagate

226
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,900
just the division property so this

227
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,630
element K and to see how how did you

228
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,910
downgrade pro-growth we will try to

229
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,770
propagate actually the elements in the

230
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,510
party set and this will be nice because

231
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,710
we will have a more accurate actually a

232
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,170
representation and so we have the form

233
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,390
of very elements you better see what

234
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,050
what happens okay for the moments let's

235
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,290
say for in the more of theoretical part

236
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,080
so actually what we can buy this link

237
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,630
and it's by using regular course I want

238
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,130
to get into details but what we can

239
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:05,270
prove is that if you have a set X that

240
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,070
possibly the division property over okay

241
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,210
and this is true if and only if it's in

242
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,300
that inspector belongs to the regular

243
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,360
code of plants which will be n minus K

244
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,330
and order and okay and this

245
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,070
correspondence permits us to to show

246
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,620
actually thinks about what of it mean

247
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,310
for a set X to ha a billboard property

248
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,770
over certain order this was a question

249
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,600
that last year many people try to answer

250
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,460
so therefore some extreme cases for one

251
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,310
to and and the answer was even but very

252
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,830
often in a very complicated way but if

253
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,390
we take the correspondence with the

254
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,060
reed-muller code we can actually and

255
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,959
give some books

256
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,990
just one or two lines so for example it

257
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,019
was proven by a son and our last year

258
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:59,089
that if it has its full feel for the

259
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:01,790
visual property of return okay then what

260
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,339
we say about asset it is that it has at

261
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:06,559
least 2 to the K elements what we now

262
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,869
come this is a result would the proof

263
00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:11,269
works very long but with real real

264
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:13,519
Muller Goods we can put this in in one

265
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,040
line just using the minimum distance of

266
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,660
these codes and what we get more is that

267
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,339
I'm happy quoi we know when the quality

268
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:25,879
happens it happens exactly for sets that

269
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,339
are as fine subspace of dimension

270
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:32,449
exactly key okay so we can recover

271
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:35,179
easily results that that were already

272
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:39,319
know what is new is that we know we can

273
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,559
describe exactly all sets that fulfill a

274
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,689
division property of order n minus 1 we

275
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:47,679
say that we know that they're exactly

276
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:53,449
all we are final deeper things ok so now

277
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:55,189
we will see how we can use this property

278
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:58,699
how we can propagate it through the

279
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:01,730
ground operations of a solution

280
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,129
permutation network in particular we

281
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:06,529
will see what happens with the party set

282
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:09,230
when we go through here - and when we go

283
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,860
through as much ok so the first

284
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,920
operation usually an Espeon cipher is

285
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,129
the addition with an unknown killer so

286
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,899
unfortunately the keys are known we

287
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,509
cannot we don't know exactly what

288
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:25,040
happens where the part is that after the

289
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,589
addition but what we can prove is that

290
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:30,350
the elements that will be in the parties

291
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,059
that after the elations will be all the

292
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:34,819
successors of the elements that were

293
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:38,209
there before so with an example let's

294
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:40,730
say and it's equal to 4 and the party

295
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,329
set of things is composed of 2 element 3

296
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:48,049
and C and now we are the same secret key

297
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:51,799
to over to all the bad elements on in

298
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:55,459
the set we don't know exactly what will

299
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,049
be the value because they are the key so

300
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:00,170
no but we know that the party set will

301
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:00,410
be

302
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,990
included in all the successors of priam

303
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,730
see that gives this to the following

304
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,670
seven elements

305
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,279
okay so let's you know what happens when

306
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,110
we go through an sbox so we'd like to so

307
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,990
we have individual and I party set then

308
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,629
we apply the and s box to all the

309
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,639
elements of the other state and we want

310
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,160
to see what what is the part is that at

311
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,370
the output they are preparing set so we

312
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,459
use the definition if you want to find

313
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:34,730
which are the elements V that in our new

314
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:40,879
party set of so after our table as books

315
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:43,370
the definition says that will be all the

316
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,149
elements be such that when you take the

317
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:51,139
sum of over F of s to the power of P

318
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:54,170
this time is equal to 1 okay and this

319
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,949
just means that the algebraic normal

320
00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:00,079
form of this function that is just the

321
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,120
product of some output coordinates of

322
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,870
the earth box contains some monomial X ^

323
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,899
you for some you that belongs to the

324
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:11,209
party set and why this is so because CP

325
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:12,980
which was not the case then the sum

326
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:18,649
would be 0 so now I will define that the

327
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:22,339
set of es you that will be exactly all

328
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:27,410
the vectors B such that as to there that

329
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,170
is just a product of some coordinates at

330
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,350
Israeli baby will contain the monomial X

331
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,040
to V U and now this silicon we can see

332
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,519
that the part is set so after the ass

333
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:43,130
box will be the union we will take all

334
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,110
the elements in the parties to fix all

335
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,730
this set v su and this so this set VSU

336
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,949
we can see little informal matrix and

337
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:53,750
it's very very important actually for

338
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,600
the resistance of the cypher against

339
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,550
this type of distinguishes

340
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,199
so here is the matrix V as you for the S

341
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,130
box of the block cipher present so what

342
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,549
we see here so the other columns they

343
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:12,530
correspond to

344
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,020
to the two products of our food

345
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,970
coordinate and there also correspond to

346
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,550
monomials so what does it mean

347
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,619
so we have here and correspondence

348
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,500
directly with the algebraic normal form

349
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,630
of a function so here you have at the

350
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,280
four coordinates the algebraic number

351
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,080
from all four Corinne is a fragment and

352
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,780
actually what you see if you look at the

353
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,970
first four column what do you have

354
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,340
vertically it's just the algebraic

355
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,610
normal form of each coordinate because

356
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,210
for example if you have the each at the

357
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,800
intersection of the row four and the

358
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,730
golden one just means that the monomial

359
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,620
X X Explorer belongs to the first

360
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:01,230
coordinate so there is also because we

361
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:07,740
can also compute the this set BS you not

362
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,480
only from the advocates and but also

363
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,300
from inverses box I will not expand this

364
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,010
into the day but actually after super

365
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,740
mutation we can easily go from one to

366
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,730
another to another and your problem what

367
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,670
have to explain this but what week we

368
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,800
can see that so columns correspond to

369
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,480
the algebraic number from all day

370
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,930
Olivia's book and two rows so we see row

371
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,110
they correspond to the algebraic normal

372
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,480
form I can't afford regular Oh bleep of

373
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,220
the inverse s box so ideally we want

374
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,770
that this focus is with this matrix is

375
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,650
as cool as possible

376
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,590
we don't want to have like sparse lines

377
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,430
for our columns so two cities I will

378
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,100
show an application to two Broke like a

379
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,550
present so the only things I need from

380
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:05,100
this design is the fact that it has 64

381
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,530
bits of a block size of that there are

382
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,920
16 and boxes of 4 bits of the Greek

383
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,990
leader there are applied in parallel and

384
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,760
so that linear layer

385
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,649
a bit permutation so you sukitooru and

386
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:24,720
his seminal paper he describes some

387
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,549
generic distinguishes based on the

388
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:29,429
division property that only exploited

389
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:32,880
actually the debris of the function and

390
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,269
not any other any other properties so if

391
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:40,559
we fix the the input size so the data

392
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,970
context of the distinguisher to do to

393
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,809
the twelve he managed to find a

394
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,590
distinguisher for three rounds of

395
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,720
presence so what I will show here that

396
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,409
is that the past taking into account the

397
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:56,250
linear layer and the sbox we can find

398
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,919
distinguishes four five four five and

399
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,750
six runs by keeping the same data

400
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,440
complexity so for doing so we will start

401
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,630
so we'll take the are in input set X

402
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,220
will have a following form so it will be

403
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,529
of size 2 to the 12 well you have three

404
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:15,539
neighbors I take all possible values and

405
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:16,860
they all got their neighbors will be

406
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,409
fixed to a constant value so we can see

407
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:21,299
from there that the part is that

408
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,360
actually as we have just after we have

409
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,590
the key issues we don't know actually

410
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,889
what which will be the value so for the

411
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:30,480
part one we have the constant value the

412
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,760
party the values of the parties that can

413
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,870
be can be everything but about us in

414
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,639
three nibbles will have the overall

415
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,799
property the saturated property we know

416
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,019
that there is only one elements in the

417
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,600
party said that is they are all one

418
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,090
vector so we know that the form of the

419
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,240
party set after the key addition will be

420
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,880
like here and this is conservative the

421
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,019
first sbox layer ok we can now take into

422
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:03,179
advantage the linear layer of present

423
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,830
because we know exactly which is its

424
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,840
form so we now just favorite the

425
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,549
elements in there in the party set and

426
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:15,240
then actually we can just use some well

427
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,840
we know what happens with with a degree

428
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,590
so

429
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,980
we know which kind of monomials we can

430
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,679
have so yeah so we have we are going to

431
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,970
be the details but it's very easy we can

432
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,539
prove but after four rounds in the party

433
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,309
said we only have elements that have a

434
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:35,120
having like strictly a great Oracle - -

435
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,409
and that means that our set has the

436
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:39,330
balance property so people have an

437
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,980
element that is equal to one then it was

438
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,750
always so the distinguisher we cannot

439
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,260
say anything anymore we would like to -

440
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,289
to five rounds but however as we can see

441
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:51,779
this is not possible for all talk of

442
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:54,770
iceboxes because we have found a

443
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,000
propagation of the parity of the values

444
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,220
in the party said that leaves that leads

445
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,370
to after the fifth round - an element of

446
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,549
Hamming weight one okay but this is

447
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:07,799
possible so this propagation is possible

448
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,840
if the earth box makes the transitions

449
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,419
from the elements each one and into two

450
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:15,899
possible so we will see what happens for

451
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:19,679
the present earth box so it will look at

452
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,510
the line that is square row corresponds

453
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,179
at V to e we saw that this row is very

454
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,809
sparse and in particular there are no

455
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:28,799
transitions to elements of Hamming

456
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,740
weight one and it's only one position to

457
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,510
an element of Hamming weight - so this

458
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,850
is a weakness of this box so we use it

459
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,860
and indeed as we were able to vary the

460
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,880
computer programming but there were no

461
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,610
element of Hamming weight one after high

462
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,470
ground so that means at the output side

463
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,159
after five rounds on balance property if

464
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,500
we want to move more actually we cannot

465
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,659
have a distinguisher like this for six

466
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,570
rounds because there are elements of

467
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,940
Hamelin Hamming weight one after six

468
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,549
roles however if we look at the column

469
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:10,289
now of the curve of this matrix we see

470
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,539
that first column is very sparse because

471
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:15,390
actually the first coordinate of the

472
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:19,710
aina of normal form of present is a

473
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,919
sonic quadratic it has very few terms so

474
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,520
what - she sees that there are after six

475
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,770
rounds elements of Hamming weight one

476
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,320
but not all the elements

477
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,420
possible particular elements that are

478
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,490
correspond to the first coordinate of

479
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,100
each of the 16 X boxes never appear that

480
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,380
means that we have 16 values that are

481
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,420
memorable so these gifts I can talk with

482
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,210
your distinguished so to conclude about

483
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:49,140
this part the present at box is probably

484
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,680
not the best for for this type of

485
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,510
distinguished that's why we had were

486
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,250
able to find this attack so if you want

487
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,190
that your S box design versus to this

488
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,440
kind of attack the best way is to choose

489
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,430
s boxes that have all of the components

490
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,080
of the earthworks are of Maximo degree

491
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,450
so now then we can prove that you will

492
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,630
not able to have this this part rows and

493
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:17,460
columns okay good we are so we saw that

494
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,320
the notion of pairing is that permits

495
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,150
actually to have to capture more

496
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,330
information during the propagation

497
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,670
compared to the division property and so

498
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,790
there okay and some open questions about

499
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,770
this so the drawback is of course that

500
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,110
it makes it takes more time and memory

501
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,160
to do to the propagation because

502
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,510
actually you have a lot of information

503
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,630
to propagate when compared to just a

504
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,520
hammock whether you have with a division

505
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,860
property so one question would be how to

506
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,110
make this more time and memory efficient

507
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,520
you
