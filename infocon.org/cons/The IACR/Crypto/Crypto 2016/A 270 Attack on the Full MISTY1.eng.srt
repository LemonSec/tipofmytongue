1
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:09,290
I'm here by one and this walk is a joint

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,980
with my supervisor professor on pancetta

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,100
in our work we present in a tech on

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,130
misty one so some general checked about

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,540
it it is a block cipher that published

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,020
in design by Matsui in nineteen seven in

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,770
God several recognition shinzi it's got

8
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,219
recognition from the Japanese government

9
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:37,220
from the European NASA project and also

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,380
been accepted in is either standard it

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,100
most famous successful it called Kasumi

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,559
that is widely used in 3G cellular

13
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,379
communication we will return to it later

14
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,829
the structures of 61 is eight round by

15
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:03,519
state structure with 64-bit block and

16
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:08,209
128-bit key and it's one function is

17
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:12,289
called fo that is also a sale on fatty

18
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:16,369
structure the same is true for the run

19
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:20,029
function of f 0 it is also say wrong

20
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:24,289
fast a structure shortly the runt

21
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:26,479
function of misty one is a complex

22
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,359
function and if it it is not sufficient

23
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,909
the designer added one more function

24
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,569
called F L to make the structure even

25
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:43,189
more complex the FL function is a fine

26
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:46,759
simple function that applied every to

27
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:55,969
wound and it uses whitening layer the

28
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:59,029
fight of the complex structure several

29
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:01,459
attacks were published in the last year

30
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:06,529
in the first row you can see a text on

31
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:10,910
reduced valiant of the size l and in the

32
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,310
last two rows you can see

33
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,620
the first detect on the full misty 15

34
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,220
cipher we are published last year by

35
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,060
todo Todd of the techs are integrally

36
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,569
Tex that uses in you a new technique

37
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,190
todo invented called division pocketing

38
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,660
so let's start with integral ethics

39
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,780
integral text uses an integral

40
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,340
characteristics and what is that it is a

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,030
prediction that an equation all the

42
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,260
equations is called tech equation and it

43
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,920
predicts that the sum over some

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,549
intermediate values equals 0 in some bit

45
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:04,319
after iran's such a characteristic is

46
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,810
called island integral characteristic

47
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,709
and the full name is case of the

48
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:13,950
integral characteristic of around where

49
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,420
k is a log of the number of values

50
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:27,329
examine 8 ok what we do with a integral

51
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:30,480
characteristic so assume you found an

52
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,440
integral characteristic start with a set

53
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,090
of plastic swing which the corresponding

54
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,340
intimate via values some 20 after iran's

55
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,790
you encrypt the relevant plain text and

56
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,260
then you got some key bit so you can

57
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,519
check whether the tech equation old you

58
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,400
check if the tech equation odd and if

59
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:08,269
it's not you can discard this gigas ok

60
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:12,239
but how you found an integral

61
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,450
characteristic this is the question el

62
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,200
todo came up with nice technique that

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,510
uses what it's called division populi a

64
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,520
division property of a set s

65
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,250
is a partition of the space in our case

66
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,979
f 2 to the power n to two groups one is

67
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:41,129
all the used such that the sum of X to

68
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:44,819
the power of you covel all X in s equals

69
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:49,470
zero in the other set is all the other

70
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,250
views now start with a set of plaintext

71
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,770
that satisfy the division property and

72
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,759
check how the division property changes

73
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,039
through the encryption process if after

74
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:13,169
island is a set of good use contain at

75
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:17,610
least one new was coordinate some to two

76
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,580
or more then you get an integral

77
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,550
characteristic of islands total applied

78
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,419
is technique to misty one and found a

79
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,870
sixth-round integral characteristic

80
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:41,130
start after the first FL layer this

81
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,310
characteristic integral characteristic

82
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:51,289
is 2100 than the previous in best-known

83
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:54,419
characteristic and the tech equation

84
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,199
predicts that the sum of two to the 16

85
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,949
three specific values is zero in seven

86
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:07,620
bits of the input to FL seven this means

87
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,909
that if you get the relevant ciphertext

88
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:15,270
you need to the Crypt just so the last

89
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,340
round and FL seven to check whether the

90
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,380
tech equation odds and this

91
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:28,139
characteristic is used in todo x we use

92
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,009
the additional characteristic in a walk

93
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:35,370
the additional characteristic is a

94
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,419
modification of todo characteristics

95
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,759
both characteristics is looks the same

96
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,960
but while todo characteristics start at

97
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,639
the plane tech side I will collect wrist

98
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,310
so in the modified characteristic start

99
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,979
at the ciphertext slide looking at the

100
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,219
decryption direction the modified

101
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:07,320
characteristics starts after before the

102
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,589
last F a light layer and end after the

103
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:14,909
second round it will be a better picture

104
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:19,020
down on the same picture so both

105
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,120
characteristics look the same and the

106
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,750
question is what is the advantage of the

107
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,279
modified characteristic we think the

108
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,750
answer is one of the weaknesses of misty

109
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:39,169
one design and the answer is simple

110
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:42,839
there are common cubits in the first

111
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:50,969
town in F of 1 and FL one so less key

112
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:55,020
material is needed to guess for checking

113
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:04,620
whether the tech equation all ok but we

114
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,240
still have the first round and F L for

115
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,069
function to pass and the first round is

116
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:17,279
a complex function so let's start

117
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,419
simplifying starting with the FL

118
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:26,849
function the 30 bit FL function can be

119
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:31,110
divided to 16 two-bit function that

120
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,469
applied in parallel and there are they

121
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:38,909
are roughly the same function this is

122
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,010
give us the ability

123
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,700
to split the seven bit attack equation

124
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,670
into up to 71 bit equation and in

125
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,470
addition in some calculation can be

126
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,650
moved before I feel fall instead of

127
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:04,520
after FL for this is because FL is a

128
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:11,100
affine function so the calculation is

129
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,240
now in before a cell phone and we need

130
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:23,340
to deal with fo one for this we use it

131
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,140
until two of the main observation we use

132
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,400
it one of the version is we can ignore

133
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,880
some part of the key why because we some

134
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,630
oval and even number of values so a key

135
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,790
that involved linearly in the tech

136
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:53,310
equation is cancelled like k of four NK

137
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:58,620
I for one in the first and the second of

138
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,010
the observation is like this because of

139
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,670
the surround by state structure of the

140
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,360
misty one function the main calculation

141
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,620
can be splitted to separate calculation

142
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,040
for example calculate the seven leftmost

143
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,410
bit of the output of f 01 given its

144
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,540
input input can be done like this

145
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,300
calculate the contribution of the left

146
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,900
side and the right side of the input

147
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,050
separately and only the end joining them

148
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,340
together the picture is like this the

149
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:47,730
left side ball so f i1 and the right

150
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,110
side goes well soon if I to with feed

151
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,970
forward the left we

152
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:05,040
that is Excel of this tourism's okay

153
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,980
before moving the next section is

154
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,110
awfully to mention that the designer of

155
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,910
a consuming the successor of misty one

156
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,310
made a small changes to prevent this

157
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,300
witnessing the splitting of FL function

158
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,319
in misty one cannot be done in assuming

159
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:35,550
due to additional notation ill and here

160
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:41,470
as for the surround by state structure

161
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:47,560
in consuming the FI function is for one

162
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,350
feisty structure due to to this changes

163
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,629
and Adele no five or more round integral

164
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:01,750
characteristic is currently known in

165
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:09,730
kissimmee and for a section of

166
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:15,610
algorithms so in our work we use several

167
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,680
techniques one of them is partial sum as

168
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,980
presented by Parkinson a tell in two

169
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,740
thousand the main idea is to get the key

170
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,730
material in several steps instead of one

171
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:42,279
big guess first you get some of the key

172
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,720
bit then you partially the encrypt the

173
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,730
relevant value and finally you reduce by

174
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,569
somatic the number of value you have to

175
00:12:55,569 --> 00:13:00,370
compute before moving the next steps the

176
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,850
next steps are similar you give some

177
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,250
monkey bits you will

178
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,760
encrypt and reduce the number of value

179
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,880
and so on and so on a second technique

180
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,380
is to dimension within the middle first

181
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,470
presented by the novotel in 2012 we

182
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,140
perform a meet in the middle attack

183
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,610
twice one we split the seven bit tech

184
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,050
equation tuto equation a 3-bit equation

185
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,850
and a 4-bit equation and compare the

186
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:50,260
common key this is this second we

187
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,230
modified each equation separately

188
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:04,030
instead of a check if a sum of values

189
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,110
equals zero we split the value to two

190
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,270
groups and check whether the sum over

191
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:17,620
one group equals the sum over the second

192
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:25,200
group ok

193
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:30,610
adding up all technic together we

194
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,740
achieve the following result to recover

195
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:41,440
the 14 9 qubits we need facing one is a

196
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,400
modified characteristics second we need

197
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,690
almost all the code book and say a time

198
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,050
of 2 to the 64 that is roughly the time

199
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:58,630
to decrypt the data the rest of the key

200
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:04,470
can be recovered in two ways one is just

201
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,140
exhaustive search that increase the time

202
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:14,950
to to to the 79 left-liberal way is to

203
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:19,320
use also todo original characteristic

204
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,930
for expert filtering this way the time

205
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:30,040
decrease under the two to the 17 but all

206
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:38,160
the day all the code book is required ok

207
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,620
to sum it we are significantly improve

208
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:52,110
the previous best known attack on the

209
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,280
full masti one cycle by a factor of 2 to

210
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:06,430
the 37 however I will attack is a not a

211
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,300
practical attack due to the amount of

212
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:17,620
data that require in addition our attack

213
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,730
doesn't walk again consuming in part

214
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,200
because the changes that made in its

215
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:32,310
design and that is the

216
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,400
you
