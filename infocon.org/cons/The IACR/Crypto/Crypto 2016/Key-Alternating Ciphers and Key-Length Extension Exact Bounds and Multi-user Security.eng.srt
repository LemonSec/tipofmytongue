00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:09,599
Thank You Vance for the introduction so

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,940
you all know the classic even Manchu

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,249
blocks have a construction which is

4
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:16,560
built on top of a public random

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,460
permutation pie and uses two subkeys l0

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,660
and l1 from this one can directly

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,950
generalize this to 80 rail construction

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:33,030
based on T public permutations x 1 x 2

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,390
and up 2 pi p + 3 + 1 subkeys l0 l1 and

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,309
so on so this the key outer dating

11
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,539
cipher of KAC construction introduced by

12
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,469
bachmann up at all this lovely object

13
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,390
has received quite a lot of attention

14
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,379
lately and for the case of 10 rouse you

15
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,019
can view it as an idea abstraction of

16
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:07,850
AES to capture the security of pee CEE

17
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,570
one typically models is by the

18
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,700
conventional CC is QB notion of block

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,469
cipher under this notion anniversary

20
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:22,979
will be wrought into a reward are an

21
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,600
ideal world in either world advisory is

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,899
provided with two Oracle's to encrypt

23
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:35,939
and decrypt in the real world yo rocco's

24
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,820
who implement the KAC block cipher and

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,899
it's inverse with a random secret key in

26
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,500
the ideal world the implement a random

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,869
permutation f and it's inverse it boat

28
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,500
was that bursary will get access to the

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:03,869
primitives by 12 PI T so have been quite

30
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,570
a lot of papers dedicated in analyzing

31
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,229
the security of ka see this live work

32
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,750
Cohen eyes in a paper by chance ty

33
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,080
burger that achieves an ice empathically

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,470
bow ok

35
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,350
I synthetically tides bow for pee see at

36
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,690
the very first glance the problem is

37
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,290
completely solved now if you look more

38
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,100
closely in that you realize a huge

39
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,740
concrete gap between what is proven to

40
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,280
kill and the best known attacks and this

41
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,490
gap is visualized here or the parameters

42
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,430
of AES meaning they attend rouse and the

43
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:53,680
block length is 128 so prior works are

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,600
with not only quantitatively but also

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,270
qualitatively so concerned with only

46
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,209
security to with respect to a single

47
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:08,200
user but in practice our adversary will

48
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,260
typically attack on mass adaptively

49
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,660
distributing its resources against

50
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,070
multiple users the bursa will be happy

51
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:23,530
as long as it can compromise somebody so

52
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,550
to model the multi-user security in the

53
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,430
real world the Oracles would implement

54
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,890
many instances of the cases of cyber and

55
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,750
likewise in the idea where it would

56
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,630
implement many independent permutations

57
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:47,739
f1 f2 and so on if you want to get multi

58
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:51,670
user security from existing work you

59
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,910
have to use a hybrid adamant but then

60
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,870
there with a degradation factor

61
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,799
proportional to the number of users for

62
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,690
the KAC this loss apiece are necessary

63
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,150
at least I'll when they are only one or

64
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,700
two rouse as recent work have

65
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,850
demonstrated so today we will show

66
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,419
concretely tight boughs for pee CEE just

67
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,580
close the gap between best numbers and

68
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,000
attacks and our results of a both single

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,870
and multi user security

70
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,540
I will show that indeed for pee CEE

71
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,280
multi-user security is quite close to

72
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,380
single user case the underlying our

73
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,660
results and a new proof techniques for

74
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,740
information graphics filthy the extent

75
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,270
and refine existing methods such as the

76
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,260
esco vision technique of battery the new

77
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,440
methods are quite general and might have

78
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,870
potential applications beyond the scope

79
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:10,370
of KAC specifically he had the boughs 4k

80
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,870
AC in a single user case we essentially

81
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,390
achieve the bowels correspond to the

82
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,820
best on attacks in a multi-user case as

83
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,630
expected there's some small loss but our

84
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,090
brazil is do much better than what is

85
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,890
achieved by a hybrid adamant as

86
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:38,060
visualized here so let me now introduce

87
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,720
our proof techniques so our main

88
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,150
quantitative improvement compared to

89
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,900
challenge Tabitha is due to a

90
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,070
generalization of the edge coefficient

91
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,830
technique that we go the expectation

92
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,120
matter when we combine this with a

93
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,090
combinatorial lemma by chillin cybergirl

94
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,480
and we immediately obtain a complete

95
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,380
type bow for single user security of Kaz

96
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,470
anyone have multi use of security we

97
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,400
give a generic translation from single

98
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,010
multi-user security with strong bowels I

99
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,990
stress that the translation is generic

100
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,420
it has nothing specific to Kaz but of

101
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,040
course because the translation is so

102
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,820
powerful it has to be conditional

103
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,050
otherwise there's no hope to beat the

104
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,360
hybrid adamant in all cases

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,490
to understand our techniques we first

106
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,470
need to review the edge coefficient

107
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,580
technique of battery this group method

108
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,800
aims to bow the distinguishing advantage

109
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,980
of two randomized systems s0 and s1 so

110
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,930
when an adversary interacts with either

111
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,139
system it will make queries to receive

112
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:08,470
answers and this information will be

113
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,330
recorded in a transcript ow the

114
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,490
distinguishing advantage is then bounded

115
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,940
by the statistical distance between

116
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,660
distributions of the transmitted that

117
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,780
the two systems produced open we only

118
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,300
deal with steady systems suggest a block

119
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,250
cipher in that case we can rearrange the

120
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,490
order of the queries in a transcript

121
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,260
without affecting the probability that

122
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,900
the system produces that car transcript

123
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,720
and it's wider edge co efficient

124
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,789
technique is so powerful in handling

125
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:55,630
adaptivity so if you want about the

126
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,220
statistical distant universe need to

127
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,770
classify transcripts by good versus bad

128
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,410
ones the next step is to bow the

129
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,000
probability that a random transcript is

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,510
bad and a maximum over all good

131
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,460
transcript of this formula once we are

132
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,039
done with that that the distinguishing

133
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,650
advantage is bounded by the sum of these

134
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,440
two numbers epsilon 1 and excellent you

135
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,270
to understand they have some intuition

136
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,150
while it is true so recall that the

137
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,179
statistical distance is the son of some

138
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:41,799
product and now if we plot some

139
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,900
rectangles whose width and the poster

140
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,290
with a product and height add a second

141
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,060
homes

142
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,900
then intuitively the statistical

143
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,980
distance it's just the total area of the

144
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,760
plotted rectangles and in this picture

145
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,240
the red areas correspond to the back

146
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,630
transcript and the blue areas or smart

147
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,460
to the good ones even this the

148
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,980
escalation technique helps us that you

149
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,170
can about the red area by this orange

150
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,330
rectangle and the blue area by the free

151
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:35,970
one now let's try applying the disco

152
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,770
edge coefficient technique on the case

153
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,839
if problem so record at that verse we

154
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,470
can make two types of queries in either

155
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,980
a construction query to the case epochs

156
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,550
either our premier queries to the

157
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,530
permutations by 12 high p

158
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,790
so the answer of these queries and the

159
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,660
answers will be recorded in a transcript

160
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,090
like this for example here the

161
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,550
transcript tells us that if you increase

162
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,930
you why then you get a sound XZ or if

163
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,680
you query or shrink v2 the inverse of x

164
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,700
3 and you get a string you empat orioli

165
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,250
one can represent a transcript by a

166
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:38,240
graph like this now to determine if a

167
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,900
transcript is good or bad when the

168
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,570
adversely three discs wearying we give

169
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,380
it a key and expand strangled with that

170
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,370
key in the real world Rocky is exactly

171
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,300
the rupee or a block cipher in the ideal

172
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,000
world the key just some random string

173
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,160
independent of something anything else

174
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,980
now this expand is transcript again can

175
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,339
be represented by a draft for example

176
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:12,890
here the graph tells us that if you ex

177
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,700
are the sub pl3 to restring be then

178
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:24,740
you'll get a string z now we say that an

179
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,650
extended transcript is bad if it's grab

180
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,950
contains some part that we call a chair

181
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:36,170
as highlighted here for Beth transcripts

182
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,860
is pretty easy to distinguish for

183
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,400
example here this transcript must comes

184
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,260
from the ideal world indeed initially

185
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,630
the trestle tells us that if you encrypt

186
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,440
why you should get Z but then when you

187
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,810
actually do the inclusion process by

188
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,920
following the chin then we end up with a

189
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,620
completely different cyber attacks which

190
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,339
is a contradiction

191
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,570
and recorded in the edge coefficient

192
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,850
technique you need to bow to numbers

193
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,320
epsilon 1 and epsilon 2 in this guy

194
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,930
batting excellent one is quite simple

195
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,530
but mounting ya number proves to be

196
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:29,710
difficult Shannon Steinberger provides a

197
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,740
pretty accurate estimation for the term

198
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,370
in epsilon 2 but when you substitute

199
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,730
that in the maximum popular you will end

200
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,620
up with a very poor Val so channelside

201
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,560
try to get around at by some twit but as

202
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,050
we saw earlier the bow is only a

203
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,360
synthetically tight so let's pause for a

204
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,600
moment and think why does the escalation

205
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,500
technique fail here the reason is that

206
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,930
it demands a single excellent tool for

207
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,530
all good transcripts see if just a

208
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,650
feel-good transcript misbehave you be

209
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:19,770
school together router in our

210
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,110
expectation matter we just demand that

211
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,800
for there must be some transit dependent

212
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,609
g of town for every good transcript ow

213
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,780
we then computer expectation value of

214
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,920
these val the expectation is taken over

215
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:49,360
all transcripts including bad ones so if

216
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,150
by doing this if just a feel-good

217
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,960
transcripts messer then our epsilon 2 is

218
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,790
still small and again the distinguishing

219
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,010
advantage is bounded by the sum of

220
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:09,130
epsilon 1 and epsilon 2 to understand

221
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,070
some intuition while it is true so

222
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,890
recall that the edge coefficient

223
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,890
technique want to buy all this blue area

224
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,410
by a big rectangle

225
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:24,690
and that can be a waste in some cases so

226
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,250
now instead we'll use some custom met in

227
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,360
a shape to approximate that if you use a

228
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,800
good bow then you can essentially have a

229
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,410
very tight estimation of the blue area

230
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:47,790
here to use the expectation method are

231
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,029
the KC problem recorded challenge

232
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:53,790
traveller re provide us with a very good

233
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,629
estimation and now all we need to do is

234
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,839
to compute an expectation value of this

235
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,879
formula the formula is cap complex but

236
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:10,980
fortunately its expectation is very easy

237
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,160
to compute and we are done with the

238
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:21,029
single user security of kc now let's

239
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:25,709
move on to the multi user setting we

240
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:27,839
will give a generic translation from

241
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,589
single to multi user security the

242
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:34,769
translation is conditional and we call

243
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:39,380
the condition point-wise proximity

244
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,839
specifically epsilon point where Spock

245
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,389
simply means that for any good

246
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:48,389
transcript for any transcript the gap

247
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:51,300
between the probability that the ideal

248
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,009
system produces this transcript and the

249
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:58,800
probability that a real system produces

250
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,399
it must be smaller than epsilon times

251
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,220
the ideal probability post why proximity

252
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,279
is a strong requirements because it

253
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,699
really implies that the distinguishing

254
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:19,910
advantage must be smaller than epsilon

255
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:23,519
so hours of says that and you can

256
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,209
establish by wise proximity for single

257
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:30,600
user security that you immediately get a

258
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,540
similar bow for

259
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,910
use of security so I stress that this

260
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,360
result needs some technical conditions

261
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,180
are the function epsilon but they're

262
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,490
these conditions are mine and therefore

263
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,850
open men's to understand why this

264
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,400
caterham is true let's first consider a

265
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,630
non-adaptive adversary meaning that

266
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:04,550
their constants q1 q2 and so on such

267
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,849
that that Bertram xq1 construction

268
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:12,740
queries on user 1 and so on so in this

269
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,150
setting if we use a habit admin that

270
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,089
already to do is to create some

271
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:23,000
intermediate system between the real

272
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,680
system and ID 1 and then use the single

273
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,370
use of security bow to fill the gap in

274
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:37,190
between X consecutive pairs this is

275
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,580
pretty standard but we need to be a bit

276
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,100
careful in accounting that verse reads

277
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,970
resources for example consider the

278
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:52,100
system's s0 and s1 now all we need to

279
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,070
care is just the construction queries on

280
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,150
the first user it's why they are only q1

281
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:04,880
construction queries instead of Q but

282
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,070
the construction queries are the other

283
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,600
users one vanish that easily internally

284
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,850
they will make some calls to the

285
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,000
primitives and so you have to account

286
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,590
for that primitive queries so the hybrid

287
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,240
agamous give us the sum of some epsilon

288
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,400
but what we want is a completely

289
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,890
different formula for the desires bow to

290
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,790
be bigger than the sum of these a salons

291
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,430
then we need the excellent functions to

292
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,840
satisfy some

293
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,850
super happy with the requirement and

294
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,370
that's the technical restriction that I

295
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:55,700
mentioned previously now the habit

296
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,400
argument that you just seen only works

297
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,900
for a non adaptive adversely for an

298
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,409
adaptive adversely there won't be a

299
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:12,080
priority Constance q1 q2 and so on to

300
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,440
resolve that if we look at an individual

301
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,350
transcript it will provide us with some

302
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,520
transcript dependent numbers q1 to q2

303
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,970
town and so on so intuitively at a high

304
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,419
level all we need to do is to repeat the

305
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,700
previous habit elements but at a

306
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,610
transcript level so that we can exploit

307
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:41,059
these numbers q1 town and so on but in

308
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:43,460
order for that to work you need some

309
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,010
sort of single user security bow at the

310
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,700
transcript level but that is exactly the

311
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:56,929
point wise proximity requirement summing

312
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:00,409
up so today we presented to protect eggs

313
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,200
for the KC problem namely the

314
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,020
expectation method and the truth generic

315
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,380
translation the former is very powerful

316
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,909
in getting comparably tight bowels and

317
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:17,510
it has applications beyond the scope of

318
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,500
KFC for example in our paper we also

319
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,500
consider the axial cascade construction

320
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,320
which is a generalization of death

321
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,890
heights but there must be other

322
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,360
applications for the torrent translation

323
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,779
it is camp elegance but it needs the

324
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,850
point-wise proximity condition not all

325
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,460
constructions meet these requirements

326
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,490
while Simon feistel network that will be

327
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,279
interesting to expand our results for

328
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:55,340
those unfitting cases

329
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,430
and that's it thank you thank you very

330
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,700
much
