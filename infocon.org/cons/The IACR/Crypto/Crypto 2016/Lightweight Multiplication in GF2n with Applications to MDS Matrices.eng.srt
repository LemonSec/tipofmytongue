1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,050
so this talk is about lightweight

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,660
multiplication in finite fields and

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,790
application to linear layer of block

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,879
ciphers and this is joint work with toss

5
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:17,970
and cons and legally under so you

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,760
probably all know the common a common

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,650
block cipher design of a substitution

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,350
permutation network which is based on

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,440
around iterated key alternating cipher

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,159
and every round consists of an sbox

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,700
layer which is made up on the parallel

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,850
application of ended s boxes followed by

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,909
linear layer which is for mixing the

14
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,859
outputs of the S box over the whole

15
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,159
state and today we focus on the

16
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,390
construction of this linear layer and if

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,909
you want to design it the goal is always

18
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,239
to optimize it once in terms of security

19
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,969
of course and is the second step in in

20
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,170
terms of efficiency and lots of

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,180
constructions of linear layers V we know

22
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,979
are based on so-called maximum distance

23
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,649
separable codes also called MDS codes

24
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:17,700
and lots of ciphers follow this approach

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,610
and for example the well-known AES is

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,729
one or one of these examples and the

27
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,009
advantage of this code based approach is

28
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,009
a so-called white race vtg which allows

29
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,259
for strong arguments on the security of

30
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,159
a primitive so let me give an example

31
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,640
what does MDS matrix mean and it means

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,680
that it reaches an optimal branch number

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,649
over two consecutive rounds which means

34
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,500
that we can guarantee an optimal number

35
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,259
of active S boxes for differential and

36
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,310
linear attacks and if you are not

37
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,049
familiar with differential and linear

38
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,240
attacks all you have to remember in this

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,329
talk is that an equivalent formulation

40
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,460
is that every square sub-matrix has to

41
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,509
be non singular and then the matrix will

42
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,819
be MDS and in this example we see that

43
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,010
if we if we choose a generic at field

44
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,710
element alpha then we can make this

45
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:22,110
matrix MDS for a suitable alpha and the

46
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,440
conditions on this property can be

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,960
phrased as polynomials in alpha all you

48
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,550
have to do is you have to compute the

49
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,400
determinants of all these sub matrices

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,280
and then you can see a list of equations

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,410
so a list of polynomials for which alpha

52
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,990
does not need does not have to do should

53
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,860
not be a root of of these polynomials

54
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,080
okay so for example alpha should not be

55
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,330
equal to zero because otherwise we would

56
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,730
have a zero entry which is the one x 1

57
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,700
matrix with determinant 00 or if you

58
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,410
consider okay if you consider other

59
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,800
matrices then you see that these the

60
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,300
other equations have has to have to hold

61
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,370
so then we have two elementary questions

62
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,410
we want to address the first is how to

63
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,440
multiply with an element alpha most

64
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,870
efficiently and the second question is

65
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,180
how to use the knowledge of the

66
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,340
efficient multiplication with the fixed

67
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,740
element to construct lightweight MDS

68
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,030
matrices and there was some reason two

69
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,370
related work on on these questions from

70
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,930
FS e 2015 2016 and recently from Africa

71
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,420
Cup 2016 in the the FSA p.e papers are

72
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,240
about constructing lightweight MDS

73
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,860
matrices under polynomial basis for for

74
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,280
the finite field and a Africa cook paper

75
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,640
focus on the XO current distribution of

76
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,800
elements on the more than polynomial

77
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,380
basis and then this talk we also focus

78
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,760
on on all possible basis for the finite

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,780
field representation so let me first go

80
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,210
to go to this question how to multiply

81
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,750
with an element alpha most efficiently

82
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,209
so we have given such an element and we

83
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,700
want to consider the function f alpha

84
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,090
which maps an element beta to the

85
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,290
element beta x alpha and there is a

86
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,680
natural representation of the finite

87
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,580
here as a vector space with n with n

88
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,680
components so if you want to to consider

89
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,270
this finite field as a deck as an

90
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,490
n-dimensional vector space we have to

91
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,470
choose a particular basis for this

92
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,860
representation and the future if we have

93
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,320
chosen the basis for this vector space

94
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,840
then we can can can form formulate this

95
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,250
this mething as a matrix multiplication

96
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,930
with the matrix depending on this basis

97
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,020
because the function multiplying with

98
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,669
the fixed element alpha is a linear

99
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:09,680
function and the linear function can be

100
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,810
represented with the matrix

101
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,979
multiplication so all what we have with

102
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:20,780
what we need now is we need an

103
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,210
appropriate metric for the efficiency of

104
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,750
a matrix which is called the X account

105
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,410
of a matrix we define it as follows for

106
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,840
an n-dimensional vector we consider the

107
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,620
linear function X or IJ which just

108
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,870
exhaust the ice component to the J's

109
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,389
component and stores the value in the

110
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:45,979
Indy is component and in matrix notation

111
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,289
this is just the identity matrix plus

112
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:52,099
one additional one entry in the IFO and

113
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:54,530
the JS column and all n other entries as

114
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,330
zero and now we define the X account of

115
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,639
an invertible matrix as the smallest

116
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,460
number T such that M can be represented

117
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,389
as T of these X or factors and then we

118
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:09,949
are free of applying a permutation

119
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:14,180
matrix afterwards because permutation in

120
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,460
hardware does not cost any extra

121
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,000
operations so there is to note that we

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,130
are also free to apply this permutation

123
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,979
matrices after every X or step but

124
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:27,530
without loss of generality we can we can

125
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,690
just a mute at the end

126
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,260
so now we know how to measure efficiency

127
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,000
we just compute the number of EXO

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,460
operations needed to implement this

129
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,760
matrix m alpha and it is to know that

130
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,800
for technical reasons we hear a strict

131
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,530
2x or operations without using temporary

132
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,110
registers that means we are using in

133
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,690
place operate operations so we are not

134
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,000
allowed to store an intermediate value

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,730
in an external register and use it

136
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,190
afterwards if you override it here then

137
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,419
it is overwritten but it is it makes no

138
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,190
difference if the X account is small or

139
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,820
equal to 2 and since all of our

140
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,900
constructions will have an X account

141
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,320
smaller or equal to 2 and this makes no

142
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,780
difference in in our case so let me give

143
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,520
an example of this choice of basis

144
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,320
operation so if we if we whispers end

145
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,820
our finite field in polynomial in

146
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,940
polynomial terms which means we

147
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,260
represent all elements as polynomials

148
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,979
and then module we compute modularly an

149
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:44,700
irreducible polynomial then we can

150
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,070
consider the so-called polynomial basis

151
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,810
which is made up on these powers of X

152
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,050
and if we now want to multiply with an

153
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:57,780
element with the element X then the the

154
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,930
appropriate matrix will be of this form

155
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,970
and this is intuitive typically do this

156
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,220
you can see why this is the case this is

157
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,470
just left shift if you want to multiply

158
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,590
a polynomial with X then you shift the

159
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,479
coefficients one position to the left

160
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,850
and later you substitute the X to the

161
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,240
for the term by this X plus 1 which you

162
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,860
can see here in the in the last column

163
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,870
so there is a special this is a special

164
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,190
kind of matrix this is a so-called

165
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,580
companion matrix of obviously reducible

166
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,299
polynomial and in general the companion

167
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,690
matrix is defined as follows for a

168
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,770
polynomial in GF in G of 2 the companion

169
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,409
matrix is defined as having all once in

170
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,560
this minor diagonal and the coefficient

171
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,650
on of the polynomial in the last in the

172
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:55,830
last column hey so back to our question

173
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,050
for a given field element what is the

174
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,420
most efficient basis we want to answer

175
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,420
the following which field elements can

176
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,490
be implemented most efficiently so we

177
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,850
kind of turn the question around and the

178
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,520
first step you we did as we try to

179
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,959
identify elements with optimal X account

180
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,820
based on a search so we randomly

181
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,310
generated n times n matrices with

182
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,430
excellent one we know the form of these

183
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,620
matrices so they must be permutation

184
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,530
matrices with one additional nonzero

185
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,230
entry and then we checked if this matrix

186
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,660
corresponds to the basis and an alpha

187
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,730
such that M is this m alpha beta so the

188
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,250
multiplication with the element alpha so

189
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,280
how to check this you can come up with

190
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,770
the following theorem that test that a

191
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,959
matrix corresponds to an element

192
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,120
multiplication if and only if the

193
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,860
minimal polynomial of this matrix is

194
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,589
irreducible and to remember the minimal

195
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:58,050
polynomial is the polynomial of the

196
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,230
least degree such that if you such that

197
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,640
when you evaluate evaluate the

198
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,040
polynomial on the matrix then it will

199
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,300
evaluate to 0 and now we can check if

200
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,200
this condition here is fulfilled if we

201
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,950
do this you you can see easily see there

202
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,290
exists this element with an X account of

203
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:29,520
one for GF 2 to the 2 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 so

204
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,680
the question is does it go on forever

205
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,310
and unfortunately it is not the case so

206
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,850
even in this very important field GF 2

207
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,880
to the 8 it is not possible to find an

208
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,500
element with the lowest X account of one

209
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,130
so why is it the case we can derive the

210
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,329
following sufficient and necessary

211
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:55,440
condition given an element alpha then

212
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,920
for this element there exists the basis

213
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,070
such that we have this matrix

214
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,480
representing multiplication with alpha

215
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,389
with an X account of one if and only if

216
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:07,790
the minimal polynomial of the field

217
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,149
element is a trinomial of degree n by a

218
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:13,510
trinomial I mean a trinomial I

219
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,610
polynomial with wait three so it has

220
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,720
three nonzero coefficients so the first

221
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,630
I One Direction is very easy to see we

222
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,209
just choose this matrix as a companion

223
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:30,380
matrix of the minimal polynomial of the

224
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,420
field element and then by the

225
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,000
construction of the companion matrix it

226
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,310
will only consist of the permutation

227
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,990
matrix plus another non 0 entry so the

228
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,880
more interesting case is that having a

229
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,040
trinomial of degree n is also a

230
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,610
necessary condition then the proof idea

231
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,510
for this is if we consider an element

232
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,320
alpha and the basis basis B for the

233
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,290
field and suppose suppose we have the

234
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,839
matrix with an X account of one the

235
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,660
first thing you can show is then that

236
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,820
this matrix is permutation similar to

237
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,730
this form so we can we know the

238
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,850
structure of the permutation we apply

239
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,250
and since the the X account is invariant

240
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,890
under permutation similarity we then

241
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,449
only have to show that the minimal

242
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:29,060
polynomial and of this matrix is a

243
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,519
trinomial of degree n and this is more

244
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,019
easier because we already know the

245
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:38,269
structure of this matrix and now we see

246
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:41,360
why it's clear that there are that there

247
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,279
are no elements with X account one in

248
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,040
this field because then let us know

249
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,649
exists an irreducible trinomial of

250
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:51,980
degree eight and so there are much more

251
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,829
other fields for this is the case that

252
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:57,079
there exists no irreducible trinomial

253
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,220
and for example by a result of Swan from

254
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,699
1962 there are no irreducible trinomials

255
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:09,050
of degree 8k for any

256
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,320
show number K so for all these fields we

257
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,779
don't can not find elements with the

258
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:20,709
next account equal to 1 and so on so

259
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:23,870
another thing we investigated is if

260
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,760
there are elements with an X account of

261
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,160
one how many elements are there in the

262
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,760
inner field for a fixed basis and you

263
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,970
can see that there are at most two

264
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,320
elements with an X account of one and

265
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,829
the other element is necessarily the

266
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:41,450
multiplicative inverse of the first

267
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:47,570
element air for a fixed basis so what

268
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,220
about an excellent of two now we

269
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,170
characterize element with an X account

270
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,510
of one what about higher except rounds

271
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,529
and in fact this turns out to be yeah to

272
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:59,600
be very difficult to understand the

273
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,720
structure here so we did experiment we

274
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,760
only have experimental results here and

275
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,120
in particular for for any field I

276
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,050
mention up to the 2048 for which no

277
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,300
irreducible trinomial of this degree

278
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,180
exists we found an element alpha and the

279
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,120
bases such that the X account of this

280
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,170
element is equal to 2 now because of our

281
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,430
necessary and sufficient condition for

282
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,829
the X account of one this result are

283
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:30,850
proven to be optimal so we found optimal

284
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:36,620
x accounts for fields up to g2 a GF 2 to

285
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,850
the 48 and it is open to characterize

286
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,010
elements with higher XO found in general

287
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,060
and because the structure seems to be

288
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:54,050
quite difficult to capture hmm what we

289
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,930
conjecture is that if if we want to have

290
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,020
an X account of two then the minimal

291
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,020
polynomial of the element has to be of

292
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,290
weight smaller or equal to five now

293
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,380
because in all our our experiments if we

294
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,440
have an excellent of two then we always

295
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,110
have a Penta no meal or a trinomial in a

296
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,570
subfield and this is also interesting to

297
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,240
see if we are in a subfield which me

298
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,700
the minimal polynomial does not have fur

299
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,040
degree then the X account can never be

300
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,390
one and if you go to higher fields for

301
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,170
example GF 2 to the 8 then the X account

302
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,060
of the subfield elements are among the

303
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,480
the highest X accounts which is quite

304
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,730
interesting and what is also interesting

305
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:50,370
is that not every minimal Penta nahmias

306
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,040
lead to an ex account of two so there

307
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,490
are pantano meals which cannot which

308
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,700
have a minimal XO count of three which

309
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,130
indicates that this structure is not

310
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:07,040
that easy to see so now let me come to

311
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,660
to our next question how to use the

312
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,709
knowledge of the lightweight field

313
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:15,600
elements to construct the lightweight

314
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,290
and the earth matrices so let me come

315
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,589
back to 0 to the example this example we

316
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:25,350
have the generic element offer and what

317
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,930
we want to do is we want to replace this

318
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,930
generic element by elements with the

319
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,170
lightest XO account in order to reduce

320
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,700
the X account of this and the s-matrix

321
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,050
so now our goal is to minimize the

322
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,360
overhead for the multiplications why

323
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,670
because you always have a static part

324
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,680
for summing up the exponentiation

325
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,430
results and what you can what you can

326
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,589
optimize is the overhead for for these

327
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:57,570
multiplications here and we concentrate

328
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:01,220
on circulant matrix this year with the

329
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,880
powers of an element alpha so if we

330
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,890
denote the X account of some element by

331
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,869
this beta X or symbol then if we want to

332
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:15,630
compute the X account of alpha to the

333
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,329
power plus minus K you can see that this

334
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,640
is bounded by K times the X account of

335
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,250
alpha this is because the X account is

336
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,709
the same for the inverse and then you

337
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,400
can always implement alpha K times and

338
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,220
you have implemented a to the power of

339
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,409
alpha to the power of K

340
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:38,750
so we did a generic search for the MDS

341
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,360
matrix dimensioned up to 8 times 8 and

342
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,159
if we denote the sum of the absolute

343
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:50,270
values of this xbox the exponents k by W

344
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,730
then our algorithm is as follows we

345
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:58,340
searched for w1 up to a predefined value

346
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,600
w max and constructed all circulate

347
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,630
matrices with the power with alpha 2 to

348
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,080
some power such that the absolute value

349
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,289
of the exponent sums up to W and then we

350
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:20,600
can bound the X account overhead per row

351
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,020
where this w times the weight of alfalfa

352
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:34,789
and so the algorithm returns an MDS

353
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:41,090
matrix m with the smallest number w w so

354
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,539
and in in our cases this leads to

355
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,000
slightly lighter MDS matrices null so

356
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,530
far from from the FS e 2015 and 2016

357
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,250
papers so we're able to slightly reduce

358
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,929
the X account here if we use the

359
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:59,240
knowledge of how to choose a different

360
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,440
basis for for the representation of the

361
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,950
finite fields so this concludes my talk

362
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,780
and thanks for your attention
