1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,300
okay we're going to get started welcome

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,460
back everybody I hope you're all

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,139
suitably refreshed after that break and

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,340
we're moving on with part two the room

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,510
session we have something rather special

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,920
to kick things off we have some

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,100
practical crypt analysis and I think

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,570
it's Daniel and live there doing the

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,180
presentation thanks guys take it away hi

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,570
hi I'm Daniel and senior senior senior

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,310
chef daniel ganc in and this is my sous

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,590
chef l'oeuf pokémon of and this is joint

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,140
work with mr pittman and trauma and even

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,850
a room in our title with lack of basic

15
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,519
analysis now who we are we are the trip

16
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:44,379
to 2016 food services team ok so when it

17
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:46,659
comes to side-channel attacks over the

18
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:48,579
past 20 years of research we've shown

19
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:50,289
that this is a very powerful tool in

20
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:51,999
extracting secret cryptographic keys

21
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:54,399
from computational devices and we

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,079
typically among these attacks on what I

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,569
call small devices smart cards sim cards

24
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:01,749
FPGA embedded microcontrollers and what

25
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:03,399
do these devices have in common well

26
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,080
that quite slow the best of them running

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,510
throughout 100 megahertz they're simple

28
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,280
it's basically one chip doing crypto

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,290
when we ask you to nicely it doesn't use

30
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,729
a lot of energy and they're highly

31
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:15,009
mobile well and indeed in terms of

32
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,810
attacks here's just one example we have

33
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,610
a card reader here a coward stuck in it

34
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,990
and the country there has been

35
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,610
acquainted with suitable technology in

36
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,450
order to monitor the cards by a power

37
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,450
consumption and from that deduce the key

38
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,130
now all recently we started exploring

39
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,469
what I call big devices basically

40
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:34,390
laptops desktops several computers and

41
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,820
these in many respects are the complete

42
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,430
opposite when it comes to compare two

43
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,890
small devices there are very complex ep

44
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,770
user on 1 gigahertz they highly complex

45
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,780
billions of transistors thousands of

46
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,310
individual components they use

47
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,560
relatively lot of energy and but the

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,140
relatively static and internal social

49
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,689
analysis well here's another example

50
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,250
this is an antenna picking up there at

51
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:57,930
magnetically

52
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,150
creation of that laptop and extracting

53
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,790
the key now in between these two family

54
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,830
of targets we are actually missing what

55
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,520
I call a mobile devices laptop tablet

56
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,640
phones and these when it comes to facial

57
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,050
analysis are the worst of both worlds

58
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,600
they're fast and complex it's basically

59
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,060
the same a CPU that we were putting in

60
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,130
our laptops two years ago we now put in

61
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,260
our pockets and on the other hand the

62
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,150
user they don't use a lot of energy in

63
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,100
the highly mobile and little is known

64
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,370
about psychoanalysis for these devices

65
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,380
now another very important research

66
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,760
topic that we've been tackling they're

67
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,709
here recently is key extra action via

68
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,900
common food items and for example last

69
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,670
year we shown you that a common Peter

70
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,560
can hold enough equipment in order to

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,340
steal someone's encryption key in other

72
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,989
words you've seen here is key extraction

73
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:48,750
by sausage where or simulating a human

74
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,880
touch we're touching someone's laptop

75
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,520
might compromise his key now this is

76
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,020
very nice but the tread they

77
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,120
unfortunately the common ingredients for

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,100
a hamburger in addition to bread and

79
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,590
meat also include vegetables and very

80
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,940
little is known about the key extraction

81
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,180
properties of vegetables so basically

82
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,830
the main question that we ask how

83
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,170
vulnerable are mobile devices to non

84
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,269
intrusive side channel analysis using

85
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,299
common vegetables and let me go over

86
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:16,920
quickly our results where we show that

87
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,410
reward ecdsa keys can be extracted from

88
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,410
mobile phones were very popular

89
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,750
implementations openssl apples common

90
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,370
crypto Corbitt growing the best and the

91
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,560
brightest here this is applicable to

92
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,570
various forms of many models and make at

93
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,480
both Android and iOS devices and some of

94
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,890
these attacks are steve applicable

95
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,810
despite our our responsible disclosure

96
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,820
but some vendors actually bother

97
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,040
deploying countermeasures so please do

98
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,530
try that at home and now you're going to

99
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,269
give a demo about how to construct an

100
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,250
islet of device for attacking an iPhone

101
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,720
and now I'm going to switch over to my

102
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,310
sushis flab who's going to show you how

103
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,459
to construct an islet of device so here

104
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,799
is a lattice device and as a lot of

105
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,690
fresh vegetables it has bugs inside it

106
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,519
so at the bottom here we have this

107
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,280
antenna and it's connected to a

108
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,020
software-defined radio

109
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,180
then two and a small Android device

110
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,190
which wouldn't submit the signal to this

111
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,620
attack extension then I'm going to place

112
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,990
this I waters on this iphone a device

113
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:19,079
which runs a CD sa encryptions and then

114
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,990
drink just a second magical appeal and

115
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,700
after placing this properly with some

116
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,330
taking slam open technical delays come

117
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,880
on put the lattice on the phone oh here

118
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,070
we go you immediately see that I lattice

119
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,960
picked up a whole bunch of signals

120
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,300
coming in from the iphone now if I were

121
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,060
to take lab signal which looks something

122
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,960
like this and each of these individual

123
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,580
bright green lines is one ecds

124
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,650
information if i were to demodulate it

125
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,120
then i would have got something like

126
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,270
this it really ugly tricks now clean

127
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,310
this up and it reveals more information

128
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,260
and we see here the sequence of double

129
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,210
and add operations performed by the

130
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,300
ecdsa signature algorithm now the

131
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,640
unfortunate part about ecdsa is that

132
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,100
ecdsa is extremely vulnerable to partial

133
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,140
to even partial leakage about secret

134
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,450
notes and after obtaining data from

135
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,030
around 5,000 signatures using the islet

136
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,560
of device where we plug in the

137
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,540
information about the SS secrets into a

138
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,210
lattice and from that using an SVP

139
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,030
server we are able to extract the key so

140
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,680
the take home message from this is that

141
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,930
many reward ecds implementations are

142
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,400
vulnerable to a letter plus lattice

143
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,590
attacks and if you want a few more

144
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,390
here's a dedicated link for for a

145
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,920
website the paper will appear in the

146
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,810
upcoming ccs and i should also mention

147
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,300
the related work Bible Gary kettle that

148
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,520
studies the different implementations

149
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,650
running on Android ok thank you and out

150
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,159
the questions

151
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:04,180
sweet thank you Twitter yeah you're done

152
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:10,850
okay moving on next on is my roots sigh

153
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,310
Rafi and next up will be garage edge so

154
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,380
Korra could make her his or her way to

155
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,790
the stage that would be most appreciated

156
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,460
we're just gonna take a moment here till

157
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,260
these guys remove their vegetables from

158
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,870
the stage Kenny did you did you realize

159
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,900
of course did you realize that so so i

160
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,450
can now has one for your best paper

161
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,860
award who I could kill who heike kills

162
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,620
playa heels for different Europe so at

163
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,900
four different events he won a best

164
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,400
paper award effectively a gold medal

165
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,560
that's a record does it make Michael

166
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,000
Phelps the I could kill some swimming I

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,080
don't know but what I can tell you is

168
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,990
that some guy called Kenny won his sixth

169
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,360
gold medal today on the Olympic track

170
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,820
cycling so there's a lot to be proud of

171
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,300
for people called Kenny thank you thank

172
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,480
you six gold medals that's Britain for

173
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,370
you we're good at cycling so I think

174
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,930
we're ready for the next speaker so

175
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,330
let's move on welcome to the stage my

176
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,880
route to take it away oh I have just one

177
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,570
slide so I don't have any need for that

178
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,370
yeah welcome to transition thank you

179
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,190
thank you know needs to applause folks

180
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,060
when NSA sends you to people they're not

181
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,730
sending you their best people they're

182
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,310
not sending you they're sending bad

183
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,590
standards thence they're sending key

184
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,360
squirrel they're sending do Ollie's

185
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,720
ederson sending back doors that is why

186
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,840
we're going to kick out all illegal NSA

187
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,480
attendees starting next year in addition

188
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,880
to that i'm calling for a total and

189
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,460
complete shutdown of cube journalists

190
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,100
from entering this conference by the way

191
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,080
I love government people and government

192
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,820
people love me a lot of government

193
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,950
people won't work for me and we have

194
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,630
great relationships my poll numbers are

195
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,460
through the roof between three-letter

196
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,250
agencies trust me leaving and you know

197
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,500
why that is that's because when it comes

198
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,580
to trade um sorry

199
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,550
key exchange agreements they are the

200
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,819
worst dfa Hellman is the worst stealing

201
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:19,219
or I mean stealing our keys and said we

202
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:21,020
should be building the wall I'm sorry a

203
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,259
paywall nobody builds walls better than

204
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,719
me believe me folks we're going to build

205
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:30,050
a paywall on a I ACR and make them pay

206
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,360
for it it's gonna work great believe me

207
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,429
speaking of which have you heard of this

208
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,519
crack off principle let me tell you I'm

209
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,630
very very highly educated I have I have

210
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,640
very good advisors I have very high IQ

211
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,880
don't don't feel bad I know math I have

212
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,459
I have the best numbers you know I know

213
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:54,769
I know quotes I know I noticed the shift

214
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:57,410
cipher and believe me just just don't

215
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,149
tell people what could you're using and

216
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:01,760
you're safe just just go with like des

217
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,180
ECB with md5 or something so so yeah

218
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,040
we're going to repeal the bad blood

219
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,510
principle and then it's going to be

220
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,959
great and quantum computer current some

221
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:20,899
computers are hoaxes thank you thank you

222
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,480
very much and next up we have a paper

223
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,269
which as I absolutely no Olympic theming

224
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:28,430
in it whatsoever as far as I can tell so

225
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,050
feel free to boo all the way through

226
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,779
this presentation folks okay take it

227
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,110
away next up is Sandra Sandra come to

228
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:46,480
the stage please yay this is the work on

229
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,329
the discovery lab problem on in pairing

230
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:53,709
based cryptography use that uses

231
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,470
cultural sector e finite fields and this

232
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,470
is a work done by all these people sorry

233
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,500
I'm I won't have time to enumerate all

234
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,350
of them so let's go for four characters

235
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,510
3 by Rihanna pairings what we need is

236
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:17,810
two groups cyclic groups and the first

237
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,660
one is G

238
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,290
e4 where G is a is an order a subgroup

239
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,140
of the surface of one of the two sep--it

240
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,839
singular curves defined by these

241
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,540
equations and n are numbered prime

242
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,800
numbers and GT is a orders a subgroup of

243
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,329
the extension field after e to the six

244
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:48,050
times N and for what then appearing on g

245
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,990
and GT is a mapping that sends two

246
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,269
points of G to one element in GT and

247
00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:02,890
that is non generate nondegenerate

248
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,480
balanar and for Chris a graphic purpose

249
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,450
we need to we needed to be efficiently

250
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:14,810
comfortable now for with respect to the

251
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,670
difficult man and for secretary reason

252
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,610
we need the deal the discrete log

253
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:28,970
problem to be had in this in G and also

254
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,860
in GT because of the mob attack which

255
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,690
was the the first to use pairings in

256
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:41,270
cryptology now if you see all these that

257
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,120
was they was used they can be used in

258
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,790
many protocols including the island

259
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,720
based different of Sakai hibiscus ihara

260
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,110
the three-party diffie-hellman of you

261
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,529
the identity based encryption of bonnie

262
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,360
franklin and the short signatures of

263
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,170
vanillin session there are many orders

264
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,220
and these protocols can be used in

265
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,579
cryptography with very efficient

266
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:15,350
implementations that was done for

267
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:21,170
example for a level of security to 60 60

268
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,490
60 bit then for that then Bernie bernal

269
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,990
in session Galbraith Arizona vulnerable

270
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,620
kimlin presented some implementations on

271
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,720
the 97 extension and for a level of

272
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,430
security to to the 80 you have also been

273
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,800
a lynch sofía vergara licensed under

274
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,899
Granger paestum for the degree extension

275
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:52,620
163 and for the soul for the so famous

276
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,279
level of security 129 bit of security

277
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,120
you have a MIDI n curson and managers

278
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,209
who proposed in 2007 this the 509

279
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:09,209
extension also implemented by Bashar at

280
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:14,070
all and for krypter krypter krypter

281
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:20,880
analytically the guys Hayashi Chima

282
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,779
Hayashi shinohara eat a kg in 2012

283
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:32,209
presented a break of that field of 97

284
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:35,339
extension degree in this amount out of

285
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,959
time which is just amazing and they were

286
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:44,120
using the jewel a CA er gorilla and for

287
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:52,260
extension 163 we used the 2013 brake

288
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,220
froze our brains and could break the

289
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:05,490
much more field of size of extension 163

290
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,270
in comparative to the first one it's

291
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:14,240
just one thousand times less in time and

292
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,880
one months ago what we broke is the 129

293
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,310
bit level of security that uses the jew

294
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,940
the jew payable alberini with

295
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,700
representation of and descent of grand

296
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,240
je granules umbral in in 222 or 23

297
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,820
careers

298
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:46,090
and we have some estimations for a

299
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:51,510
higher level which is of number of bits

300
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:56,860
121 192 and here what we use which is

301
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,250
new here is the delay weeks descend and

302
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,120
we estimate to break this field this

303
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,860
field we estimate the time that we have

304
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:11,320
to run the algorithm like this so for

305
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,560
more details about this work just see my

306
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,070
PhD thesis that's it thank you thank you

307
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:27,490
very much so we survived the teaser well

308
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,970
done okay next up we have Sandro karate

309
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,040
talking about the archives of the IOC

310
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,880
and next after that will be 0 much matsu

311
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,310
so if Matt Susan could make his way to

312
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,350
the stage that would be most welcome go

313
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,850
ahead so as some of you probably know

314
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:50,500
I'm Swiss and that comes with some

315
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,770
advantages so for one with beautiful

316
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,560
mountains as opposed to the Austrians

317
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,530
with a plus in our flag we get free fun

318
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,110
do all the time recognizable passport

319
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,370
and we get free access to the archives

320
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,560
of the international olympic committee

321
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,950
and as it so happens just before this

322
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,740
conference I went down there to Lausanne

323
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,370
and I

324
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,710
had a look at what kind of interesting

325
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,950
documents they have there so I found a

326
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,830
number of very curious reports so here's

327
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,750
the first one written by some guy called

328
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,200
Restless Zika virus protection for

329
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:37,640
Olympians I try to really did had some

330
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,140
interesting stuff in it I could really

331
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,720
figure it out so I went to the next

332
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,700
report which was written by ulrich

333
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:53,390
morrow I hope I got that right i also i

334
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,870
also tried to read that it was quite

335
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,970
abstract so i'm not sure i could follow

336
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,360
everything

337
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:06,970
yeah so don't worry about me i'm i'm at

338
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,010
nyu now so it's a kids anyway I also

339
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:20,409
found this bye bye Eugene duties very

340
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:23,199
interesting report on life lessons I

341
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,589
look into it so here's like part of the

342
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,929
table of contents so it's like chapter

343
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:34,510
15 is like my favorite sayings then here

344
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,580
is how I get post Docs to run around

345
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,710
with silly amounts of frame and I don't

346
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,570
a nice essential soon so okay so if you

347
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,340
didn't get the shrimp joke so it's like

348
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,260
I was I came here on sunday i was

349
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,419
hanging out that the dinner and then I

350
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:55,240
got this message on my phones like it's

351
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,480
it

352
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,309
so yeah we try to please and so I got

353
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:16,769
this ball and then somebody from UCSB

354
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:19,129
took the ball away from me so it was

355
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:24,690
quite a mission anyway seems whoever

356
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,350
wrote this to me was very happy and but

357
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,749
then you know seeing the mornings like I

358
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:37,100
wasn't quite sure what to do with it

359
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:50,760
so our answer yes I'm really running out

360
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,450
of job options here is so anyway after

361
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,360
some time I I decided to put the shrimps

362
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,230
in the fridge and turns out that I just

363
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,180
checked before and they were still there

364
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,900
so

365
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,340
so yeah people are suggesting I auction

366
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,700
them off so if you feel like

367
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,480
contributing another 384 times twenty

368
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,730
seven dollars to pretty schmancy we can

369
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,060
do that later anyway another report was

370
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,680
by this guy hunts garay who reflects on

371
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,800
you see and he looked at you know what

372
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,990
asynchronous communication looks like in

373
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,810
useless so if if you if Alice tries to

374
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,430
send frames to Barbie turns of the new

375
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,910
see the adversary might eat all of them

376
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,840
and what we're really interested in is

377
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,220
that all the friends get eventually

378
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,230
delivered and none of them are eaten I

379
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,960
don't want to explain this anymore it's

380
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,740
like but you can do it by you know

381
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,260
having the adversary specify some delay

382
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,730
that for some strange reason he has

383
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,380
doing unary so anyway let's just skip

384
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:21,220
that and go to the next report

385
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:30,149
so this guy Martin Martin hurt he

386
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:32,759
actually in his report there's the

387
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:35,039
constant runny synchronous MPC protocol

388
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,459
which is used to secure against an

389
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:41,309
adaptive adversary the corrupt up to and

390
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:43,319
third of the players it's obviously

391
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,859
constant ground makes black box use of

392
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:51,479
one-way functions so let's skip that if

393
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,879
you're if you're interested you can read

394
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,099
the print report and I thought that

395
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:58,259
instead of having an acknowledgment

396
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:14,969
slide I put up apologies thanks I was

397
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,849
great so next up is shinichiro might sue

398
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:19,649
and Chris biker could make his way to

399
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:28,859
the stage please over to you can hear me

400
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:31,009
okay

401
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,110
okay so my thought is not a joke so

402
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,120
today I would like to introduce new

403
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,340
Olympic Games holbrook with the client

404
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,080
Brock Jane okay so let me think about

405
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,179
assault team sports team spot is a

406
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:52,130
cooperation between us to distribute

407
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:55,400
autumn last entry and the soul so in

408
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,080
general suggests and clear consensus

409
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,380
roof to play game and so to win so you

410
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,529
need so we're all emerged strategy

411
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:06,440
tactics and team members with diverse

412
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,020
three strings I think that as I she

413
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,350
added a good team and the sauce over 30

414
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,080
years or history of the crypt is a good

415
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,799
big game in this world I think that saw

416
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,500
recently so we have the servant problem

417
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,309
about the TRS but also center so kini

418
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:27,679
person so with your help I think that as

419
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,140
a TS probe protocol become a so mature

420
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,289
thank you but also in the case of

421
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:35,659
Bitcoin block chain I think that this is

422
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:38,659
not much enough that we have so many

423
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:41,779
things to the results so we back to the

424
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:45,039
solution a lot of the Olympic spirit

425
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,010
ideas are these forties and we object as

426
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,429
security toodles so we have so serious

427
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:56,539
cases that ow so the ether in digital

428
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:59,570
israel-based project had a chance to

429
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,960
rode over 50 million dollars and after

430
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,870
that the out cases we need so more

431
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,149
secured brockton technology for all

432
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:10,549
aspects rock-tenn technological efforts

433
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:13,789
to protect rock chain and so we have

434
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:16,490
many athletic events in this technology

435
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,010
that Brockton is aspect of the network

436
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,539
technology console always with

437
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:23,059
cryptography and applications or any

438
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,760
others of business logic included in and

439
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,510
we need so many sir researches on on it

440
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,140
and so we are now so building new or

441
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,480
attack stadium for Brockton technologies

442
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,450
this is so called BF dot network and so

443
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,520
we are now building as a neutral table

444
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,130
Athena research test Network this is

445
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,260
rhykker so NSA head for the Internet

446
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,250
technology and so this is also by the

447
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,690
produced by the international

448
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,580
universities and each diversities

449
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,300
becomes a proxy node and do research on

450
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,280
Brock day and its application it is not

451
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,880
related to security and so we always

452
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,700
have they're so sweet several nodes from

453
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,190
united states united kingdom of japan

454
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,830
and we are now adding more nodes and we

455
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,880
encourage you to join this new piece

456
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,370
assessment and the next match of this

457
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,170
Olympic game is a scaling with going

458
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,660
back sure this will help in october

459
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,030
eight and nine at military and

460
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,950
submissive that ryan deceptive a second

461
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,350
and so we encouraged to submit the new

462
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,570
attacks from the taco in brockton thank

463
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,689
you

464
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,080
okay moving along next up Chris

465
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,930
and beyond Chris will be Sandra Diaz

466
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,780
Santiago if she's here great good to see

467
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,950
Chris take it away ok good ok so just

468
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,350
announcing challenges for learning with

469
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:58,260
errors over rings oh that was a freebie

470
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,190
I'm gonna have to work a little harder

471
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,620
for the rest of the jokes but this is by

472
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,390
my student Sarah Crockett who

473
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,710
unfortunately couldn't be here this week

474
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,640
and me so real quickly ring Alda gooey

475
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,190
learning with there's over rings

476
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,840
informally the problem is in the search

477
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,390
version to find a hidden secret ring

478
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,030
element given many noisy products with

479
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,370
that element so you see these crypto

480
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,100
talks with a I comma B I and B is s

481
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,930
times AI but with a little bit of noise

482
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,060
added to it okay and then the decision

483
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,130
version is similar it's like distinguish

484
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,740
such noisy ring products from just

485
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,020
uniformly random ring elements okay so

486
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,060
these are these are the problems we're

487
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,950
using so but formally you know you have

488
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,260
to define this stuff an instantiation of

489
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,480
bringing lwe is given by specifying a

490
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,940
ring a modulus and error distribution

491
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,160
maybe even a number of samples that the

492
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,840
adversary has and then once you fix

493
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,020
these things you have a proper ring lwe

494
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,810
problem and instantiation so this is an

495
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:59,670
attractive post quantum candidate for

496
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,410
several reasons one is that we have

497
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,150
supporting asymptotic worst-case

498
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,590
hardness proofs related to ideal

499
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:08,580
lattices in the ring and the recently

500
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,890
there are many many experimental rural

501
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,570
deployments that tour is considering at

502
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,640
Google actually has deployed it in an

503
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,890
experimental capacity on its canary

504
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,950
version of Chrome and what they found is

505
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,710
it's pretty guard pretty fast so that's

506
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,460
good now there's one thing we have to

507
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,840
notice that the these practical

508
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,750
instantiations do not use the kinds of

509
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,310
parameters that are supported by the

510
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,650
worst case artist proofs there instead

511
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,360
supported by crypt analysis because what

512
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,610
we've noticed over many years is that

513
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,310
this these intentions seem to be hard

514
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,050
even if you use you know slightly

515
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,790
smaller error than recommended or even

516
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,320
much smaller error than

517
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,509
than the theorems asked for if you make

518
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:49,740
it too small then the problem becomes

519
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,419
easy but there's kind of a no man's land

520
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,039
here which is not covered by the

521
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,399
theorems yet may never be but also you

522
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:58,230
know crypt analysis can't seem to break

523
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,049
it given the efforts so far so in order

524
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:04,740
to further develop more confidence in

525
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,570
these kinds of problems we're announcing

526
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,190
the ring l.d.b.d challenges so these are

527
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,649
challenges for 516 instantiations of

528
00:27:10,649 --> 00:27:12,960
search ring lwe and the related problem

529
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,880
learning with rounding over cyclotomic

530
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,710
rings which are the most commonly

531
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,009
proposed and implemented versions doing

532
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:21,419
decision challenges is tricky for

533
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:22,769
reasons that you can read in the paper

534
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:24,570
but we give a wide variety of

535
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,490
instantiation 'he's ranging from toy

536
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,980
which you should be able to break in

537
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,419
maybe under minutes on your laptop once

538
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,370
you get things working too easy which

539
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,600
should be breakable probably in a month

540
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,440
or a couple months to very hard so

541
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,480
there's a whole variety of things if you

542
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,399
think you can get some lever into any of

543
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:42,690
these things there's probably an

544
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,730
instance out there for you that you can

545
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,429
try to attack power of 2 cyclo tomic's

546
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:50,519
powers of three powers of five powers of

547
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:53,190
2 x powers of five prime oriole

548
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,379
cyclotomic that's the one on the last

549
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:57,990
Pro moderately sized Prime's anything

550
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,029
you like errors of various widths

551
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:03,350
ranging from trenta which is what the

552
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,789
worst-case hardness theorems for ring LW

553
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:09,600
ask for to Grande which is like what lwe

554
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,690
theorems ask for too tall which is what

555
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,759
is typically used in practice too short

556
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,320
which is like pretty aggressively short

557
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,840
i would think pretty risky moduli of

558
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,110
different forms etc etc the number of

559
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,090
samples okay so a core issue in

560
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,649
developing challenges of publishing

561
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:27,029
challenges for problems like ring all

562
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:29,250
the buoy is that a dishonest challenger

563
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,250
could publish four challenges which are

564
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,049
too hard or even impossible to solve

565
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:36,000
simply by adding a whole bunch of error

566
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,269
or just putting out random junk and no

567
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:40,799
one would be the wiser they'd never be

568
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,149
able to detect it and the Challenger

569
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:43,830
would say AHA this is a hard problem no

570
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,110
one's ever solved it okay so this is

571
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,909
different from factoring and discrete

572
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:49,889
log where if you pick you know

573
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:51,840
unbalanced primes or something you're

574
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,250
just making it easier for the attacker

575
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,460
so this is a way to be dishonest and you

576
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,019
know if you're dishonest it makes the

577
00:28:58,019 --> 00:28:59,760
Crypt analyst angry and you wouldn't

578
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,490
and one is angry so how do we know the

579
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,460
challenges are properly generated well

580
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,870
the answer is simple but this is

581
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,210
actually the implicit answer given by

582
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,060
prior challenges for example the entry

583
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,950
challenges in lwe and multivariate

584
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,110
Quattro quadratic challenges so if like

585
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,730
mckayla maroney you are not so impressed

586
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,460
with that answer we have a better one a

587
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,410
non-interactive verifiable cut and

588
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,320
choose protocol which works like this

589
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,600
for each instantiation all 516 of them

590
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,880
we have actually generated 32 instances

591
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,560
and we've bundle them all up into an

592
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,870
archive which you can download right now

593
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,930
on BitTorrent and this so this stage is

594
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,690
complete now tomorrow around noon the

595
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,220
NIST randomness beacon will tell us

596
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,350
which instances to be the official ones

597
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,260
and we will then spoil the rest by

598
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,970
revealing their secrets and the

599
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,710
pseudo-random generator seeds that we

600
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,020
use to produce them okay that will

601
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,370
happen on Friday because I have to get

602
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,590
home okay so we're going to post these

603
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,540
on friday and then anyone can verify

604
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,630
that the spoiled instances look good you

605
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,040
know their errors are small enough and

606
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,320
the prg see it actually generates the

607
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,300
exact instance that we put out which

608
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,800
should give you confidence that the

609
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,050
official ones are also good because if

610
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,550
they weren't good we'd have a pretty

611
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,160
good chance of being caught and you know

612
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,340
caught cheating okay so that's pretty

613
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,900
much it there's a website which has

614
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,970
paper links instructions on how to

615
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,010
verify things and so forth long URL

616
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:29,220
short URL take picture Oh since this is

617
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,720
my only chance to stand in front of you

618
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,310
and announce these things the challenge

619
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,250
archive has this shot 256 hash and it

620
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,410
was time stamped on the blockchain on

621
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,360
october fourteenth which is like several

622
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,800
days before the nist beacon so no

623
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,800
shenanigans there okay and oh for our

624
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,000
protection we're signing all the

625
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,850
archives under the pgp key with this ID

626
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,770
but don't use the ID because there is a

627
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,720
fake make sure it has this fingerprints

628
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,240
okay good get cracking

629
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:05,770
ok John Kelsey if you're in the room and

630
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,549
it's going to be your turn soon hey John

631
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:12,280
ok and next up it's one of this group of

632
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,240
authors I guess Gina is the speaker no

633
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,650
okay introduce yourself and go ahead

634
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:23,230
Thanks ok so good evening ladies and

635
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,990
gentlemen I am here to tell you a tale

636
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,110
about the Crypt olympic games and i

637
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,760
would like to mention that the outdoors

638
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,840
of this metaphorical tale rd- as Garcia

639
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,120
lil Maria Rodriguez Enrique's gnarly

640
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,340
crews Cortez and meet Sandhya Santiago

641
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,010
and we have a little help of this artist

642
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:45,280
address cortes de Valles and artists do

643
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,059
sing in a cryptographic conference so

644
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:51,760
let's start a long time ago the

645
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,059
cryptographic game was a question of

646
00:31:54,059 --> 00:32:02,580
life or death so fortunately

647
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:05,740
unfortunately sometimes history has not

648
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:11,410
been fair so we know that until 2013

649
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,020
Alan Turing granted a posthumous pardon

650
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,970
by the Queen and was until 2015 that

651
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,140
these women obtained some recognition by

652
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,929
but for his work in the contribution

653
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:29,799
during World War two so fortunate

654
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:32,940
luckily for us twenty years later

655
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,250
cryptographic games not so dangerous so

656
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,820
now some new disciplines appear as you

657
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:43,809
can see here so here we have the top

658
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:47,890
greatest crypto crypto eclipse so maybe

659
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,450
we are missing something we apologize

660
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:53,169
for that so we have a sorry we have

661
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:56,650
probable probable wrestling post quantum

662
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:02,620
volleyball beach by Larry so also we

663
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,879
have some

664
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:07,539
sticks so here we can see all the all

665
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:11,799
the cryptographic conference as you know

666
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:14,319
so the winner in these conferences our

667
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:19,690
cryptid with 36 editions and then we

668
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,929
have a row crypt with 35 then Asia crib

669
00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:26,579
with 22 in the crib Africa trip and

670
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:30,249
Latin crib just with three traditions by

671
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:34,119
now so what are we doing me in the

672
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:36,449
meantime in Latin America so we already

673
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:42,129
trying to do our best effort so but as

674
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:45,669
we can see we need to to do a lot of

675
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:51,940
work now so I take this opportunity to

676
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,209
introduce to this group of girls we are

677
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:57,519
for girls cryptographic cryptographers

678
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,949
Latin American s from instituto

679
00:33:59,949 --> 00:34:03,009
politécnico national so we are trying to

680
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:05,919
make a difference by girl power so if

681
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,899
you want to know more about us you can

682
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:12,579
see our web page or email and also our

683
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:26,349
Facebook so thank you okay so please evo

684
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:28,569
get ready next up is Joan Kelsey who

685
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:31,589
will be representing Belgium play so

686
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:34,268
well we've outsourced tower development

687
00:34:34,268 --> 00:34:35,679
of crypto standards to Belgium haven't

688
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,460
we told you so so I'm going to talk

689
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,710
about the hash function pentathlon so

690
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,629
little history here if you know the

691
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:45,969
modern pentathlon in the Olympics is

692
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:48,518
supposed to be sort of roughly based on

693
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:51,969
the five events that that would that

694
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:53,829
would capture what a 19th century

695
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:55,268
soldier should know so there's like

696
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:56,949
fencing to capture sword fighting and

697
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,180
there's a shooting event and a horse

698
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,920
right horseback riding in a couple of

699
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,440
their events so I want to talk about a

700
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,420
an event that's really important it's

701
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,730
the modern hash functions and tafel on

702
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,579
right so if you have a hash function or

703
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:11,140
something that use it that does stuff

704
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,910
like a hash function does you actually

705
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,200
would like to do a lot of things with it

706
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,910
so fixed links hashing that's what

707
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,540
everything does shot too

708
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,060
five everybody to fixed-length hashing

709
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,940
also you know with the shakes in 5002

710
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,310
you see variable length hashing so you

711
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,660
can generate as many bits as you need

712
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,610
from the output but there are also a

713
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,660
bunch of other things you might like to

714
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,180
do like keyed hashing like H Mac but you

715
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,190
can do that more efficiently or a fast

716
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,870
parallel hash where if you have a huge

717
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,780
long message you can take advantage of

718
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,700
parallelism to hash the thing and get it

719
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,850
get an answer fast also hashing is to

720
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,200
pull of strings so if you have five

721
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,930
strings as your input you don't just

722
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,400
concatenate them and do the wrong thing

723
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,720
that the hash function actually does the

724
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,820
right thing for you part makes it kind

725
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,310
of a possible encoding so those are our

726
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,260
events so the contestant is ket Jack

727
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,620
which actually we selected as the Shah

728
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,780
three winner and wrote in and put into

729
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,750
phipps 202 and so we have two of these

730
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,940
things in phipps 20 to the fixed length

731
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,130
and variable ink hashing are already

732
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,230
defined in phipps 202 but we didn't have

733
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,150
good ways to take catch I can make them

734
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,010
do these other things yet you kind of do

735
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,660
it with other constructions but it's

736
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,060
nice to have something specified so we

737
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:24,110
have a new draft as p800 185 and this

738
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,830
specifies for new functions ok first

739
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,080
function is called see shake its shake

740
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,640
it's the same its variable length hash

741
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,050
functions you just like a hash function

742
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,760
but you can ask for as many bits output

743
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,310
as you want but it has this extra

744
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,990
advantage that it has a customization

745
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:42,080
string so you can get you this lets you

746
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,160
do something a little bit like strong

747
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,050
typing for hash function you can say

748
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,790
what it's for that may or may not be

749
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,440
useful it's not clear exactly how to use

750
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,240
that in protocols but it's Lee simply it

751
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,830
maybe well maybe we'll make the world a

752
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,950
better place we also have kmac for key

753
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,530
hatches does the scheme that was defined

754
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,700
originally for catch act for Keith

755
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,890
hashing we also have a fast parallel

756
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,480
hashing scheme that lets you take

757
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,070
advantage of parallelism and we have a

758
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,140
tuple hash that encodes the strings for

759
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,420
you in a possible way and you does

760
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,850
everything right so this is all in 50 in

761
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:15,440
this new draft of 800 185 so all of

762
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,780
these functions have these properties

763
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,370
domain separation from each other and

764
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,990
from all the Shah threes they have

765
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,360
support for user selected customization

766
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,980
strings they have you know variable

767
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,630
length output you can use them as as off

768
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,740
which means you don't even have to know

769
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,570
how many output bits you need when you

770
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,360
start drawing outputs from them

771
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,670
so hopefully this is useful with this is

772
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,160
right now out for out for public comment

773
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,130
a deadline is what September 30th and

774
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,870
you can see the email address you can

775
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,970
see the URL please look at this document

776
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,640
tell us what you think if we're if you

777
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,660
think it's good you think it's bad

778
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,690
whatever we'd like to hear from you and

779
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:58,760
that's everything thanks a lot ok so

780
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,430
mostly please get ready and next up is

781
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,260
somebody who is actually Belgian namely

782
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:07,400
Eva that's met so at the ram session in

783
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,950
europe clipped they're actually they

784
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,950
call the tram session and what we saw is

785
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,590
that truck was actually doing

786
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:17,540
weightlifting and what was the actually

787
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,330
trying to lift yeah amazingly he was

788
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:24,020
trying to lift is er ok so this is not

789
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,210
what I drew and I'm thankful to

790
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,730
basically the organizer of the term

791
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,590
session at euro crypt who made that

792
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,170
slide and so basically it is making

793
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:37,610
photography great again so what about

794
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:43,220
having Clinton again so what will it

795
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,640
mean for us ok because we only care

796
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,050
about ourselves and something may be

797
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,620
unexpected so can you expect the same

798
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:57,290
again so in our field that means key

799
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:06,460
escrow again are you ready I am are you

800
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,400
the FBI they are ready okay so always

801
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,820
fifth the FBI said that basically the

802
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,640
agency is collecting data and that will

803
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,220
be presenting it next year after Clinton

804
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,770
wins for sure in hopes of sparking a

805
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,630
national conversation about law

806
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,130
enforcement okay so you be better ready

807
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:31,960
what about Clinton and research haha

808
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,820
what about that will dramatically change

809
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:40,010
why would it maybe so I think there will

810
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,330
be lots of money for research and

811
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:47,320
obfuscation are you understood the point

812
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,920
why because it means an aqua skated

813
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,550
government is just great okay you mean

814
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,740
no longer know how it works it no longer

815
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,680
know what it does but what if people

816
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,260
complain you remember the invite the

817
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,380
talk yesterday if things don't work

818
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,830
blame the cryptographers so if you don't

819
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,350
like obfuscated government it just blame

820
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:16,370
the cryptographers is there a solution

821
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:21,560
ah you know the Putin hacked the Clinton

822
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,250
campaign and made big news so can put in

823
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:30,050
hell up this time and I'm not going to

824
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,200
put a picture of Putin here

825
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,100
unfortunately the answer is no they

826
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,050
don't have a technology okay so they

827
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,480
will not be able to help this time so

828
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,610
the question is then who the heck has a

829
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:44,030
technology amazingly the Koreans do have

830
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,690
a technology for those of Europe 2015

831
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,270
they were breaking basically this multi

832
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,970
linear Maps okay so who do we have to

833
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:57,009
ask yeah the Koreans

834
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:09,030
thank you so Alison please get ready and

835
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:14,580
first up right right now is multi you

836
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,319
okay so I didn't find this in the

837
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:41,750
Olympics I really looked very hard and I

838
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,310
don't know what happened you know so it

839
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:48,530
was act so but with the number the time

840
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:53,089
that I have I have to to speed so okay

841
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:55,220
so I'm going to talk about destroying

842
00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:02,720
subliminal channels and subliminal

843
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,480
channels are the subject of that I

844
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,490
called clipped ography at the time 20

845
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:11,420
years ago and these are hacked

846
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:16,400
implementations and you know they are

847
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,400
subtle and the time they were kind of

848
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,640
theoretical but then this lattice came

849
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,700
and told us that actually they are being

850
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:33,829
used and now I called the attacks on

851
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:36,290
cryptography cryptography clipping the

852
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:41,329
power of the attacker and many people

853
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:45,319
work on it many defending mechanisms

854
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:47,810
that are coming up combining

855
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:50,750
architectural assumptions and crypto

856
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,900
very few functionalities being

857
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:59,569
considered there's no agreement on their

858
00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:01,609
model there are various models as I said

859
00:43:01,609 --> 00:43:03,260
architectures are involved and it seems

860
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,380
complicated and to do blackbox

861
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,160
reductions can fail so the state of the

862
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,970
art there are mechanisms that assume

863
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:17,770
that the key generation is honest and

864
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:21,400
use deterministic encryption because the

865
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,349
randomization is the source of

866
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:26,630
subliminal channels and so on decrypt

867
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,849
ability assumption in which the check

868
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:30,920
here knows how to decrypt or assuming

869
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,010
trusted we randomizers so there are

870
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,589
various trusts assumptions and you know

871
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:39,339
the cats or the lattices don't like it

872
00:43:39,339 --> 00:43:43,790
so the question that we say we ask is

873
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:44,960
can we

874
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,890
she've standard cpa security for public

875
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,099
key encryption without these extra trust

876
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:56,660
assumptions and on the way the big

877
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,490
hurdle is to destroy the subliminal

878
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,830
channels there is a model there's

879
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,810
adversary there's the the watchdog

880
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,750
there's the user who is the adversary

881
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,710
controls all the component and tries to

882
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:12,260
subvert the system so of course we need

883
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,359
a technique to do it and the technique

884
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:20,510
that we suggest is decomposed and Imelda

885
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,450
May up you know it's essentially modular

886
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:26,359
design break the system into pieces and

887
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:30,740
a new new task a new functionality of

888
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,390
this you know we know it's good for

889
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,119
software engineering for testing but now

890
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,359
it will be good for testing by the

891
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:41,390
watchdog against subversion so this is

892
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,000
so systems like this with when the

893
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,410
randomness is fed into the key

894
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:48,050
generations are our bed we don't know

895
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:52,190
how to do it even if we put random

896
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,330
Oracle in the middle and there is still

897
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:58,839
subversion this this is kind of known

898
00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:01,490
they still exist this aluminum channel

899
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,700
so we decompose into the component and

900
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,670
these enables the watchdog to test each

901
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:12,160
component wise by itself and its kind of

902
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,930
we have a combination of combining the

903
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:17,720
randomness in that's the in a nutshell

904
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,900
and also testing the component allah

905
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:27,290
program checking methods ok so this

906
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:30,830
gives the result stego free randomness

907
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:34,280
generation key generation and encryption

908
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,180
and thank you very much

909
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,240
thank you so for those standing over

910
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,130
there are still a few a few free seats

911
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:47,980
here and from and then you will be able

912
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:52,600
to enjoy Allison's talk and she will

913
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,150
have a little help from her friends so

914
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:58,120
Allison please take it away thanks so

915
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,500
I've been thinking a lot this year about

916
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,090
these conversations we've been having in

917
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,980
our community about the divide between

918
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,620
theory and practice and I'm having a

919
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,090
little bit of an existential crisis

920
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:08,680
about this because it seems to me that

921
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,800
applied people have more fun they get to

922
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,190
be measured on cool metrics like speed

923
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,450
participate in things like breaking

924
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,940
things whereas theory is a much more

925
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,330
esoteric sport it's more subtle and more

926
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:24,130
subjective and measured in vague terms

927
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:27,940
like gold and silver holy grails so I've

928
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,840
been thinking about what to do about

929
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,030
this and considering the ways that

930
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,310
theorists have tried to event address

931
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:35,260
this divide in the past we've tried

932
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,690
ignoring the problem we've tried

933
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,760
absorbing the problem into a theoretical

934
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,090
model

935
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,200
we've tried ignoring the problem some

936
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,090
more when that theoretical model doesn't

937
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:48,670
seem to capture everything so really it

938
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:52,450
seems like we've tried everything so I'm

939
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:54,940
here to suggest a new path forward for

940
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,820
theory in integrating with practice and

941
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,620
so the new sport that we like to propose

942
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,980
is conversion if we simply convert all

943
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,630
the Crypt analysts to be theorists our

944
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:07,930
assumptions will be safe forever so the

945
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:10,270
new york-area cryptographers would like

946
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,760
to give you a demonstration of what this

947
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,830
would look like today so I like to thank

948
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,620
Nadia henninger to be our first

949
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,860
volunteer of a crypt analyst to

950
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:32,980
potentially be converted all rights this

951
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,290
is this is going to be tough so bear

952
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,590
with me

953
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:45,069
ever since I was a child I tried to be

954
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:49,779
the best so what happened my family and

955
00:47:49,779 --> 00:47:53,410
friends all said I was blessed so what

956
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:57,099
happened it was supposed to be all so

957
00:47:57,099 --> 00:48:00,279
exciting teaching crypto at university

958
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:04,209
but I allowed my fate to be shaken but

959
00:48:04,209 --> 00:48:07,089
what was the matter with me I've always

960
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:10,029
longed to prove the impossible to

961
00:48:10,029 --> 00:48:13,719
encrypt things no one ever dare this was

962
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:16,479
the time for me to step up so then why

963
00:48:16,479 --> 00:48:20,679
was I so scared hacker who factors

964
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:24,429
puppies what's so scary about that I

965
00:48:24,429 --> 00:48:28,529
must trust that my math is mightier

966
00:48:28,529 --> 00:48:33,219
always has my back and I must be clearly

967
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:37,970
devout I can't have even one shred of 10

968
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:41,540
I believe

969
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,180
the Lord God created

970
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,770
universe in which the

971
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:52,260
hi

972
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:56,690
out of Ewing has your paw

973
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:07,420
I feel the stress i know that i was

974
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:12,720
going to things my man

975
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,880
Oh

976
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,520
Oh

977
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,870
I believe

978
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:53,770
right

979
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,800
Oh

980
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:05,099
to just believe and now I can feel the

981
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:07,859
excitement since the thing I was born to

982
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:12,300
do and I feel so incredible to be

983
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,200
sharing my faith

984
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:20,789
if you ask the attacker itself but you

985
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:25,339
must assume without any doubt and

986
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:30,220
I believe

987
00:50:30,499 --> 00:50:34,220
