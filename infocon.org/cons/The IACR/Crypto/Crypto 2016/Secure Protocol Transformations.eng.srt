1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,069
thank you for introduction so the

2
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:08,870
tapestry is secure for her

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,369
transformation and the modified

4
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:14,900
computation involve a combination

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,260
between two or more parties without any

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,320
information or input and output in order

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,930
to capture potential attacks there have

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,670
been a variety of security model

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,100
discards the sensitive started snowin

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,000
vision 1980s for example with where the

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,309
bursary is malicious or not whether a

12
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:37,070
particular is county or not and other

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,060
operational parties can be corrupt in

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,399
fact there are more dimensions to

15
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,430
discuss so this makes the low landscaper

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,809
of Pacifica quite complex

17
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:58,210
hence natural question is where we can

18
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,340
automatically transform results from one

19
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:07,430
model into the others no there are human

20
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,189
inventions of Fowler questions for

21
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:12,079
example where we can you know file

22
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,209
simplify critical results for instance

23
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,490
pTWC at the a provides a protocol which

24
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,130
to ensure 1/3 and the low pimping or

25
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,829
deny has a protocol which will raise

26
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:28,100
your lesson help can we convert a

27
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,229
protocol in bit of elasticity

28
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:32,509
region into a protocol with higher

29
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:38,139
security like in norman penetration and

30
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,880
through transformation we would also

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,429
like to know whether the efficiency

32
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:46,340
technically barata for one model can be

33
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,719
extended for the others hence not deny

34
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,810
of the protocol can be more mature with

35
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,039
respect to the security model and we

36
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,649
also like to have actual technique

37
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:03,679
schneider used ad hoc in the literature

38
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:06,709
as a transformation theory such as a

39
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:12,710
superior elimination so we have a few

40
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,060
results in our paper

41
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,060
personally we pre-render

42
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,270
work up a batch transformation we also

43
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,940
give a few transformations in this

44
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,660
setting a prime this transformation to

45
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,420
existing protocols in order literature

46
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,980
we obtains a pure result as a repair

47
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,349
already and we also have impossibility

48
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:40,900
results regarding records transformation

49
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,540
and so let's see the mango papaya past

50
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:55,600
Reformation twister major aperture of

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,450
interest in this framework is protocol

52
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,450
scheme a perfect scheme is a program

53
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,810
that converts functionality into a

54
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,910
protocol for example

55
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,910
Yoshio so here is the whole scheme at a

56
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,160
yard sale my honest secure protocols and

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,640
webparts transformation is it yourself

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,640
portal scheme for a target model data

59
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:29,350
use a source model as a local but but we

60
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,280
have to be helpful so because hi the

61
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,410
products being temporary because you

62
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,049
know the source model and construct a

63
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:41,799
protocol for a from scratch it won't be

64
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,180
a meaningful principal mention right so

65
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,810
we do not allow the perpetual convention

66
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,540
to act on the functionality the

67
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:59,109
regularly it only used as a box for

68
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:03,940
example here she can only depend on at

69
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,430
SFA box and pipe is defined using a

70
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:15,030
patriot spy purposes in general the

71
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,608
PayPal transaction can assess the source

72
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:21,700
mode or proto's beings multiple times

73
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,610
and there can be multiple source models

74
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,390
so PayPal transamination can be used for

75
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,160
security augmentation data transform

76
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,380
weekly secure protocol spins into a

77
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,900
swagger protocol schemes for example the

78
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,680
IPS comparable issue either uses a skin

79
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,410
of usage security with earnest maturity

80
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,890
and the skin or semi RSS security to get

81
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,650
a scheme of usage security with no

82
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,230
honest majority and it used to

83
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:08,150
weak weak secure source models and

84
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,700
generate targeted strongest cue target

85
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,590
Amato protocol and PayPal transformation

86
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,370
can also used for efficiency leveraging

87
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,660
their improving the efficiency of

88
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,360
multiple protocols by company weakly

89
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,380
secure but efficient the protocols for

90
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,360
example the paper break hearts

91
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,650
transporation uses a first loss ratio

92
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,830
skin by one and still has facial skin

93
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,730
pi2

94
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,240
to get a faster hydrate your skin

95
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,630
it's the not improved security level of

96
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,170
pi/2 but it does improve its efficiency

97
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:54,680
by combining a faster protocol by one

98
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:02,000
and so in you know people we we tip

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,460
several paypal transformations for both

100
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,350
security augmentation

101
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,840
efficiency leveraging send essential

102
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,570
thing of many of these transformations

103
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,140
is a new security model called partial

104
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,670
identifiable abort and this in this

105
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,750
statement the bursary is allowed to cost

106
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,960
about in time but when an opponent

107
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,520
happened a subset or party is identified

108
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,150
with at least in operation of land

109
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:44,550
our cooperative so it sent home for one

110
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,449
have identified Bob about people to

111
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,000
parties are identified in about event

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,280
then at least one of land is cropped so

113
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,190
how to identify dropout is useful as an

114
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,790
intermediate security notion for example

115
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:12,139
we can if we want to get a for security

116
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:17,039
photo scheme from photo skins in the

117
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,860
GWAC city region we can take a partial

118
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,370
identifiable as a intermediator step so

119
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,350
the transformation from partial

120
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,320
identifiable about to food security is

121
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,840
can be achieved by Prairie enumeration

122
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,430
in each repetition the equitable parties

123
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,370
from the given protocol and if an app or

124
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,460
even a parent a group is identified with

125
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,599
at least 50% of them are corrupt and

126
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:55,410
then with the activity group the

127
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,570
procedure is repeated until there's no

128
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,530
anymore abort event so if our initial

129
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,520
set is earnest majority then the active

130
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,820
state will always keep earnest maturity

131
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,310
to implement that idea we requires the

132
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,590
input and of the shared by local team

133
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,789
secret sharing and this can be done by

134
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:29,240
$10 secretion in process mix so we spend

135
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,070
24 measuring from partially identifiable

136
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,279
to food security it's the transformation

137
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,339
from food security to ensure that

138
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,089
one-third and semi-arid security with

139
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:45,120
ratio won't help to pass your identifier

140
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,420
boat

141
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:55,279
and the duties we constructed a new

142
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,290
PayPal chance of management by modifying

143
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,560
the IP as a jerk emotion the basic idea

144
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,279
of IPs is to lower the virtual server in

145
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:07,220
a head using active rescuer outer

146
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,120
protocol and implemented each double by

147
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,010
a semi unless the secure inner protocol

148
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,940
and the cooperation in inner protocol

149
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,810
can then be Wickery detected using a

150
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,610
watched this mechanism in IPS the what

151
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,060
is the mechanism is implemented using OD

152
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,560
hybrid but for the honest majority

153
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,420
setting here is the vision that you use

154
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,079
with OT we call G can be implemented

155
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:47,450
efficiently in we call the protocol the

156
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,269
sender has the impure AP and receiver

157
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:54,020
has a input X and the receiver is this

158
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,899
patio to to output express B so in a

159
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:00,620
first ROM

160
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,220
they send their the input of the shares

161
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,370
of their input to all the parties the

162
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,640
parties computer dose of experts be no

163
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,690
curry and in the second one the puppies

164
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,730
standard assures ex-parte to the

165
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,920
receiver and then the receiver

166
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,250
reconstructed the value because any

167
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,990
attack

168
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,640
correspond to 18 achieved to express be

169
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,430
the security can be guaranteed by using

170
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:41,089
healthy encoding and IPS county security

171
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:44,480
with abort the part is about SOS

172
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,230
shootings reported by a watcher here we

173
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,279
modify it to be a one half identifiable

174
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:59,840
abort so take a it is and halt

175
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,540
the Pressman episodes from the watch

176
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,390
channel later Mickey's and the

177
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,400
pestilence and Kofi countered

178
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,140
Switzerland here we can either Mickey or

179
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,320
goofy is lying but from a public view

180
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,840
you can also be the President himself is

181
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:26,610
lying so to identify a set of two so we

182
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,070
did have Mickey and goofy along the

183
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:35,000
views publicly so if Mickey goofy

184
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,860
does has inconsistent view then either

185
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:46,560
one upland is nine and if McCann goofy

186
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,700
has consistent view then the president

187
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,340
would be able to identify one who change

188
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,370
the water like Mickey's line or

189
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,390
Goofy's lying

190
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,550
so combining these techniques we have a

191
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,949
transformation from photos piensan

192
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:15,370
picture WCCT region to the partially

193
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:23,920
identify a power port and we can improve

194
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,860
the efficiency further by it's probably

195
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,769
to the recent majority stating and use

196
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:34,889
an expanded web to specify the watchlist

197
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:42,510
so applying this transformation to know

198
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,959
it's written protocols we could have

199
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,279
power in calories first if we use

200
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,680
efficient a protocol for danke issue at

201
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,339
go6

202
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:57,130
then we can get a constant rate protocol

203
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,120
where the communication cost is only

204
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,170
depends on the number of artists and for

205
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,130
natural circuits we have almost linear

206
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,339
communication per party with a uppermost

207
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:16,360
ratio since our divisions holds from

208
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,990
Norway this arithmetic circuits it can

209
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,060
be considered as a complimentary result

210
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,490
of pentane some very useful skill which

211
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,230
has efficiency for no depth circuit and

212
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,160
a prime further efficiency leveraging we

213
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,230
has almost linear total communication

214
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,589
with near optimal to assure this

215
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:45,760
improved once near once at the threshold

216
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,100
in danke Schon Oh God

217
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,250
and we also have a high cost knackers

218
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,209
your knowledge but from two-party

219
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:59,589
multi-party computation similar to the

220
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:04,959
results of come in and musu but using a

221
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,850
constant number of commitments ok so

222
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,610
let's go on the impossibility result

223
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,060
no personal impossibility is

224
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,880
functionally by passport protocol it's a

225
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,030
power function professor of course this

226
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,640
first defined in goes to like a twelve

227
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,070
assuring one wave function and here we

228
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:37,580
tip and unconditionally results so

229
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,100
functionally proper protocol consider

230
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,100
transformations without using any source

231
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,470
models and just produce a protocol by by

232
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,240
box using the function narrative and the

233
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,270
function memory we consider here - sure

234
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,720
approve is a boolean function

235
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,340
parametrized by a prince to Train

236
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,930
parents between alpha and F alpha is at

237
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,560
a price y equals one people know if it's

238
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,160
all y equals alpha as an impossibility

239
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,040
we show less no propulsion summation

240
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,130
from seminars to to a creepy security

241
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,339
the two surest we assume the existence

242
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,920
of one-way functions and consider a

243
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,850
memory old energy proofs so to sum up

244
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,160
all right to give you a take-home

245
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,770
message 2020 well in a protocol for one

246
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,530
model consider is imprecation to other

247
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,280
models superpowers misinformation

248
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,630
usually you can imply quite a few

249
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,290
calories and when develop a new MPC

250
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,430
technique Singapore whether it's a

251
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,220
PayPal chance information and there are

252
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,730
many open questions affordable in the 9%

253
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,000
home we'd like to know back bath

254
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,430
transpiration between more models for

255
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,900
example the but the transmission from

256
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,050
synchronous set into a synchronous

257
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,520
setting and with also nineteen normal

258
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,019
impossibility results that are separate

259
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:34,019
the different models you know bypass

260
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:40,889
square and I suppose I would like to see

261
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:44,550
more and better and PC protocols to new

262
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:50,530
bypass transformation so thank you

263
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:56,350
