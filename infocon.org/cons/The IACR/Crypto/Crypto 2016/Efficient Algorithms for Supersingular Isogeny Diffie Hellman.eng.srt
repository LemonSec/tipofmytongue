1
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,340
thanks for the introduction good morning

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:07,819
everyone

3
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:11,330
yeah so this is joint work with my my

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,790
two colleagues at MSR Patrick longer and

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,110
Michael narrator a both up the front

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:20,300
here okay so we've heard some different

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,529
opinions on when or if quantum computers

8
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:26,599
are going to come and destroy all the

9
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:28,909
public key crypto that we're currently

10
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:32,210
using and a lot of people some people

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,410
think that it's never going to happen

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,460
some people think that they already

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,340
exist and a lot of us have are in some

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,840
camp somewhere in the middle but the

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,820
agencies and companies around the world

16
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,190
are doing their due diligence and have

17
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,539
announced that the standards are going

18
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:51,460
to be updated in the next decade or so

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,850
anyway so in August last year you might

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,410
have seen the announcement from the NSA

21
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,160
that the the sweet B cryptography will

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,739
be the the sweet base is going to be

23
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:06,670
updated to include post quantum

24
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,460
algorithms and in this just this month

25
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,170
following a sequence of announcements

26
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,700
nest have said and even said last night

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,480
that they're going to be pushing for an

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,640
agenda over the next five years with a

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,460
deadline late next year to look at post

30
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,940
quantum candidates now this is just the

31
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,370
examples in the States but in Europe and

32
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,140
Asia and all over the world there's many

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,090
many many companies groups and

34
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,760
organizations that are investing a lot

35
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,460
of time effort money into examining post

36
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,810
quantum candidates to see what we're

37
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,350
going to do to replace all of these all

38
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,610
of these things that will fall if a

39
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,900
quantum computer or when upon some

40
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,720
computer comes so in our group we've

41
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,610
been seriously looking at this problem

42
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,090
as well and and in general when you go

43
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,440
and look at any of these documents that

44
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,040
talk about post quantum cryptography you

45
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,710
see sort of four common themes or four

46
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,510
common arenas that people are

47
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,010
considering or seriously considering to

48
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,869
look for post common quantum primitives

49
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:11,269
lot of space a lot of space stuff like

50
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:14,150
Andrew and LW it's ring variance code

51
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,910
base cryptography hash based and

52
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,550
variant based and often after these sort

53
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,000
of four strong pillars of post quantum

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,230
primitives you see a paragraph or a

55
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,460
subsection mentioning all the other ones

56
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,710
and sometimes you see isogen e-base

57
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,860
mentioned along alongside some other

58
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,600
ones but we sort of from all the study

59
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,200
we've done so far we think that that my

60
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,510
sahjhan ii base is worth being

61
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,120
considered as one of the five the five

62
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,680
pillars that we should be looking at for

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,710
post quantum public key public key

64
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,020
crypto so and this were in this talk

65
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,690
we're going to be looking at this fifth

66
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,150
one I saw Janee based crypto why it was

67
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,880
super super senior Janee dippy help and

68
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,720
it was introduced by Jo and de faire in

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,860
2011 I think one of the reasons that it

70
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,880
it might not yet be considered as as

71
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,350
stronger of an option as the other four

72
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,060
is because of simply because it hasn't

73
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,650
withstood the test of climates it's much

74
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,020
newer than these other four but on the

75
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,600
other hand it really offers a lot more

76
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,320
or in some situations it shows a lot of

77
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,750
potential compared to these two these

78
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,920
other four primitives in particular yes

79
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,080
it's it's a lot younger and it's so that

80
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,080
the conference is is a bit smaller but

81
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,140
so the key sizes the the best attacks

82
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,170
against si th are exponential in in the

83
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,930
size of the the prime field and

84
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,810
therefore we've we've got a primitive to

85
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,820
do a GP home and whether the public keys

86
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,700
are a lot smaller than a lot of these

87
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:58,720
other variants and so oh yes okay so the

88
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,550
first thing I want to warn you about is

89
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,230
not to be deterred by the word super

90
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,450
singular because for those that have

91
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,400
been in the game of code base crypto for

92
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,030
a long time will know that super senior

93
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,220
kerbs have had a rough ride in in

94
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,290
cryptography starting with the original

95
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,940
ACC papers that recommended super

96
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,310
singular curves as an option because

97
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,959
they were easy to count the number to

98
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,100
write down the number of points on them

99
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,710
and then in the 19th we saw the attacks

100
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,080
by by fray rock and the attack that

101
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,150
showed that we could use appearing to

102
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,100
attack the the finite field version and

103
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,080
then they were brought back when

104
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,400
pairings were used for constructive

105
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,850
purposes and then we decided that there

106
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,110
were ordinary pairing friendly herbs

107
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,190
that were better than super singular

108
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,979
curbs and in recent times those super

109
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:43,570
singular curbs that that seemed to

110
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,400
survive that that the low characteristic

111
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,690
ones as you saw in the last talk have

112
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,930
been have been attacked but all of this

113
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,090
is kind of irrelevant with respect to

114
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,780
this talk because all of those highs and

115
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,300
lows of super singular curves have

116
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,900
related to the discrete log problem and

117
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,340
the point is that in this work the

118
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,990
discrete log problem is is irrelevant

119
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,639
this has nothing to do with a discrete

120
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,100
load problem in fact the curves that

121
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,590
that we use in s idh you'd be

122
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,120
hard-pressed to find a curve that has an

123
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,500
easier discrete log problem in there

124
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,090
then the curves we use so the discrete

125
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,470
log problem is easy on these curves it's

126
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,800
got nothing to do with that so the word

127
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,270
super singular makes you feel cautious

128
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:27,070
don't try to ignore that that hunch okay

129
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,030
some basic facts about about ice dodging

130
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,240
ease for anyone that's done the basics

131
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,419
of elliptic curve cryptography you deal

132
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:40,539
with isogen ease all the time if you're

133
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,910
computing it doubling that the

134
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,680
multiplication wait that's a nice so

135
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,840
Janine it's just a particular case of

136
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,220
Adar sorry where the where the delay in

137
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,200
the co-domain that the curves you wanna

138
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,930
need to or the same curve but as sahjhan

139
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,960
is is more general than that then the

140
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,220
multiplication by M that which is

141
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,450
endomorphism and isogen e is is a it's

142
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,510
an app that takes points on the curve

143
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,539
e12 points on the curve e to so when you

144
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,250
come to double the point you do some

145
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,020
computations in its x and y-coordinates

146
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,490
and magically you'll end on the on the

147
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,220
same curve and i Sajid e is kind of even

148
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,630
less magic than that if you like you

149
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,760
still do some computations in the x and

150
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,770
y-coordinates but you land on a

151
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,889
different curve it's all it's it's all

152
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,370
very natural because it's a it's a group

153
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,450
homomorphism and so it's it's there's a

154
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,130
very natural one to one correspondence

155
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,830
or connection between

156
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,409
sajin ease and and their colonel so if

157
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:46,020
you write down a colonel a specifier

158
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,599
colonel by the definition of it being a

159
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,360
group homomorphism if if the isogen e

160
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,840
maps a point p to the identity or the

161
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,750
point infinity if you like then it would

162
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,669
map any multiple of that point to the

163
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:04,379
point infinity so it's we naturally have

164
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:06,360
this correspondence between a nice ogyny

165
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,710
and it's colonel

166
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,139
and it should be said that i so up to

167
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,780
isomorphism if you if you specify a

168
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,610
subgroup on an elliptic curve there

169
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,150
existed isogen e and an image curve that

170
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,280
unique i sahjhan e an image curve such

171
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,370
that that subgroup is that is the kernel

172
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,940
group and and we write the weird the

173
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,810
right that the the image curve is the

174
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,940
sahjhan ET one order to the a one

175
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,960
question with with the subgroup you know

176
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,509
a degree the degree when i've sahjhan is

177
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:41,389
the number of elements in its kernel

178
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:43,740
which is the same as its degree as a

179
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,150
rational map so you should think of a

180
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,990
nice our journey as being as i said a

181
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,870
generalized the the general case of an N

182
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,240
on autism which is whether the two

183
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,270
curves are the same and if you're used

184
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,190
to dealing with an isomorphism then an

185
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,690
isomorphism is just a nice ogyny of

186
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,469
degree one where the where the kernel is

187
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:07,169
trivial and so high degree of Sajha need

188
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,330
to have a non-trivial kernel but these

189
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,430
are just a nice our journey is just a

190
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,060
general a generalization of these these

191
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,710
two things that we're probably used to

192
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,090
dealing with you've done even the basic

193
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,279
ECC stuff okay so here's a here's a

194
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,810
brief history of s ideation where it

195
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,000
where it comes from

196
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,500
in 2006 after a series of papers russian

197
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,990
papers by starburns Albany's and his

198
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,099
advisor or us observe they proposed

199
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,140
doing ice la journée based

200
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,610
diffie-hellman

201
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,490
but they chose ordinary curves to

202
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,110
instantiate the the diffie-hellman in

203
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,420
2010 Charles Djou and sukharev

204
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,089
gave a quantum sub-exponential Albert

205
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:58,110
to attack to attack the ordinary case

206
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,439
when that when the the curves used were

207
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,110
ordinary so in 2011 gerund DeFeo fix

208
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,660
this by choosing why instead choosing

209
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,399
super singular currents for those that

210
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,019
don't know the difference that it

211
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,610
there's a lot of equivalent definitions

212
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,050
of ordinary and super singular but an

213
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,639
elliptic everything is either one or the

214
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,709
other so the natural thing to do if

215
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:19,529
ordinary curves were were broken or or

216
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,600
there's a sub R exponential attack was

217
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,069
to look at the super singular case and

218
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:25,470
that's what Jared if AI did successfully

219
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,360
in 2011 so the the yeah as I said

220
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,649
there's a lot of equivalent definitions

221
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,240
you can see silver honor or any of the

222
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,589
good elliptic curve books to see what

223
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:35,699
the difference between super singular

224
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:40,100
and an ordinary is but for our purposes

225
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,350
the the important thing is that the the

226
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,860
endomorphism ring of super singular

227
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,439
curves is non commutative in in the

228
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:50,699
ordinary case it's commutative and

229
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:52,100
that's what allowed them to do this

230
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,009
quantum sub-exponential attack but this

231
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,499
non commutative commutativity of the

232
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:01,319
animalism ring is what what makes the

233
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:04,050
attack not work in the industry the

234
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,249
singular case so that's what gives us

235
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:08,910
this these confidence that at least that

236
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,709
attack isn't applicable in the super

237
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:16,379
singular case okay so this is kind of a

238
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:20,610
cheat sheet for for you that if if you

239
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,929
don't take anything else away from the

240
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,839
talk if nothing else makes sense then

241
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,449
hopefully you just take this slide away

242
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:29,339
on the in the two left columns we've got

243
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,379
the the diffie-hellman that we're used

244
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:33,660
to doing finite field diffie-hellman an

245
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,360
elliptic curve diffie-hellman where our

246
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,199
elements elements modulo prime our

247
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:42,709
exponents are typically integers and

248
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,569
we've got these analogs of you know the

249
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:47,279
fundamental operation in diffie-hellman

250
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,220
based base crypto exponentiation in the

251
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,910
group and of course the hard problem is

252
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,370
that is the discrete log problem the

253
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,269
inverting that operation so in the SI d

254
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:04,139
h case our our elements are curbs in a

255
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,339
nice ogyny class i'll talk more about

256
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,060
that in a second

257
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,160
and our secrets are are the ice Lajja

258
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,800
knees okay and so the the fundamental

259
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,630
operation that we're going to do in SI d

260
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,720
h is to to get our secret ice dodging e

261
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,029
and to map it and to apply it to a apply

262
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:26,110
to a curve e and output the isogen he

263
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,320
evaluated at that curve okay so the the

264
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,089
problem that we're basing our security

265
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:32,709
on is given the curve and its image

266
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,300
curve to go and find what that secret

267
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,350
eye surgeon he was now although this i

268
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,820
said that it's only been around since

269
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,490
2011 we've got some confidence because

270
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,709
this problem this general isogen e

271
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,899
problem has been studied by by

272
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:48,820
mathematicians and and cryptographers

273
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,920
for some time it's appeared in in

274
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,990
several other contexts as well so we've

275
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,610
got confidence that it is hard to solve

276
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:01,959
now what do these as far as what what

277
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:04,300
sort of a setting we've got what it

278
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,519
looks like it's you shouldn't really

279
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,329
think of the elements as being a group

280
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:13,899
it's not a group as such but but what

281
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,110
we've got is a very well connected graph

282
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,750
a well connected regular graph where the

283
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,329
nodes are elliptic curves or rather

284
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:24,519
isomorphism classes of elliptic curves

285
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,230
so every node in this graph is an

286
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,600
elliptic curve and the edges in the

287
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,279
graph are the ISO journeys between them

288
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,500
and in a super singular case we've got a

289
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,300
really big graph it's well connected

290
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,269
it's it's regular and it's got this this

291
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:39,279
nice property that but Gerald if I talk

292
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,569
about this Ramanujan property where

293
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:45,279
we're told but if you from from any

294
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,779
point in the graph so long as you work

295
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:50,350
you walk far enough you you can land at

296
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,199
any other point in the graph and and in

297
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:55,209
s idh we certainly work much further

298
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:56,829
than that to make sure that from any

299
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:59,319
point in this regular graph we can land

300
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:05,589
at any other point ok so here's here's a

301
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:08,529
very simplified version of s idh here's

302
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:10,480
their side eh in a nutshell sweeping a

303
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,920
lot of details on the under the rug in

304
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,250
this slide but there's this public base

305
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,959
curve a not that everybody has and what

306
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:20,500
alice is

307
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,190
is she's gonna choose her secret ice la

308
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,360
journée and the way she does that is

309
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,140
just by choosing a secret subgroup on

310
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,380
ignored

311
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,880
remember subgroups and our journeys are

312
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,170
in or in correspondence with one other

313
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,330
so Alice chooses this secret subgroup

314
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,590
and computes the isogen e @ e nought

315
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,100
computes 5a and publishes her public key

316
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,510
as a of a a technicality is that alice

317
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,190
is going to compute - - I so journeys

318
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,660
and Bob's going to compute three isogen

319
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,220
Eve's as long as these two things that

320
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,080
co-prime it just it's just a nice way to

321
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,310
make sure that they don't interact with

322
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,950
each other and and everything is

323
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,540
well-behaved but Bob's going to do the

324
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,570
same thing he's gonna evaluate his

325
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,580
isogen e at the base curve and publish

326
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,720
his public key EB then they're going to

327
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,540
compute some different isogen e to land

328
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,300
at the shared secret baby now the

329
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,860
obstruction that Jaron DeFeo had to

330
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,900
overcome this kind of non-trivial

331
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,450
obstruction is that because the anymore

332
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,000
isn't ring isn't community even they

333
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,430
that fire Bay could not just be applied

334
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,910
to to this image curve as is and so a

335
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,350
technicality that I won't get into too

336
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,810
much details about is how they overcame

337
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,000
this but essentially what they have to

338
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,840
do is and I ask you not to worry about

339
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,700
keeping the details here but these are

340
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,940
just for for future reference what they

341
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,300
have to do is is evaluate also evaluate

342
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,850
their isogen ease at some generator

343
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,050
points and this means that they can that

344
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,060
they can eventually arrive at the same

345
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,670
kernel so without without this extra

346
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,650
information it's hard to know what what

347
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,780
these five be - and fly a - should be

348
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,690
but so long as Alice and Bob not only

349
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,580
compute their I VI sahjhan his curve but

350
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,120
also evaluate the ISO Janee at some

351
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,620
public generators and each other's

352
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,450
public generators then that's enough for

353
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,420
them to arrive at this this shared

354
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,490
secret so that's the obstruction that

355
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,300
was overcame in this 2011 paper and I

356
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,940
should say that because these the nodes

357
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,890
in the graph isomorphism classes the

358
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,450
shared secret is the jain variant which

359
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,820
is which is the same regardless of

360
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,380
which curve they arrive at as long as

361
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,500
it's in the same isomorphism class okay

362
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,120
so that's how that's how a side eh works

363
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,880
in a nutshell there's some some details

364
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,130
that have swept under the rug like the

365
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:48,740
fact that in these secrets are chosen as

366
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,180
subgroups of the torsion and the torsion

367
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,250
to Jeannette two-dimensional which is

368
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,420
why there's which is why there's two

369
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,970
points here chosen we the way we

370
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,500
actually choose this secret subgroup is

371
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,810
to choose a secret scaler and to compute

372
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,650
this this is two-dimensional PA plus si

373
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,170
si times Q a which chooses a unique

374
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,970
subgroup in the two-dimensional torsion

375
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,640
we couldn't just fix one generator here

376
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,870
because it would always be the same

377
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,670
subgroup that we're in okay so what

378
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,280
about the security again sweeping many

379
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,700
details under the rug but the security

380
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,140
that the setting is these elliptic

381
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,720
curves over FP squared where P is a

382
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,030
large prime all super singular elliptic

383
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,010
curves are defined over FP squared and

384
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:40,400
our hard problem here is not only given

385
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,220
the curve and its image but given those

386
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,980
two points on the curve and their image

387
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,260
under the ice ogyny so it looks like the

388
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,580
ice large any problem with a little bit

389
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,200
of extra information that that is

390
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,270
believed not to add any advantage at

391
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,010
least in the abstract sense of the

392
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,510
problem so the the hard problem is

393
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,560
you've been given the curve in its image

394
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,330
try to find this secret ice dodging e

395
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,920
what would the secret subgroup that was

396
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,650
used equivalently to compute that I so

397
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,270
Janine the only difference between this

398
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,579
and in general the general I such any

399
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,430
problem is that because of the nature of

400
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,550
the system the isogen e that we're

401
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,829
dealing with here has a fixed public and

402
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,670
smooth degree but yet we believe that

403
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,400
this doesn't the problem is still very

404
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,780
very hard under this under this

405
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,950
situation now the best known attacks the

406
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,290
best known classical attacks are big our

407
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,030
paid the 1/4 in the in the prime

408
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,480
characteristic of the field and and

409
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,590
that's the best classical attack and the

410
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,870
best quantum attack is is big our pay to

411
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,880
the one on the seeks now the knife sort

412
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,519
of

413
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,039
confidence confidence building fact

414
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,840
about this is that these are sort of

415
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,669
given this this problem of trying to

416
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:54,789
connect trying to connect two nodes in a

417
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:56,470
graph whether the degree of the

418
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,720
connection is known this is a classical

419
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,659
sort of problem in in computer science

420
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:04,149
called the core problem and as as J

421
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,120
under Fela say these complexities are

422
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,539
optimal for for such a problem so the

423
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:13,029
best known attacks are currently generic

424
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:15,309
which kind of reminds us of a cc in a

425
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:17,919
way the best known attack is Paulo right

426
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,870
which is generic it doesn't use any of

427
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,080
the underlying structure which is which

428
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,830
is confidence building for now but it

429
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,940
should be said and I should have said

430
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,320
earlier that one of the things that we

431
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,740
really like about the SI th being having

432
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,279
such small keys is the keys are so small

433
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:38,259
but even if these attacks even if

434
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:40,179
different attacks come around where

435
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:42,220
these exponents are even better

436
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,929
the problem is still very interesting so

437
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:46,450
long as it's not a catastrophic you know

438
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,950
sub-exponential or polynomial time

439
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,879
attack then si th is very interesting

440
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:54,970
compared to the other the other for the

441
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,889
other for post quantum primitives okay

442
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,259
so let's start to talk about how we how

443
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:05,470
we do these computations we need to

444
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,100
compute we need to compute progenies of

445
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,889
some degree now it should be said that

446
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:13,299
computing in our journey of degree of

447
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:16,350
primed ignorant prime degree L has

448
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,360
complexity at least big are labelled so

449
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,419
it's a if exponentially large primes

450
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:25,629
it's these algorithms exponential but we

451
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:29,980
need an exponential number of of isogi's

452
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,769
and kernel subgroups for this for this

453
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:36,330
problem to be hard so the upshot is that

454
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,649
the authorities must have exponential

455
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:40,269
degree but to be able to compute them we

456
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:41,769
need to do these things in logarithmic

457
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:43,509
time and so we can't do that unless

458
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:46,149
they're unless they're smooth so we're

459
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:47,379
going to only be using our slider needs

460
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:49,960
a degree L to the e 4l being a two or

461
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,100
three and so this is how it this is

462
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,990
briefly how it works

463
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,030
suppose we've got a point R naught of

464
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,100
order - to the - to the 370 - this is

465
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,680
actually from our implementation the

466
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,010
parameters that we used then of course

467
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,830
we can't specify all - to the 372 points

468
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,650
in the kernel of that in a subgroup of

469
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,510
not to compute that isogen e in one go

470
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,400
we have to factor this thing into two I

471
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,740
sahaja news so what we're going to do is

472
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,740
start with our naught and multiply it by

473
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,550
2 to the 371 to almost kill it and then

474
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,890
this point has order 2 which means that

475
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,350
we can we can proceed from a naught to

476
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,520
e1 using a to our journey and then we

477
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,400
evaluate that to isogen e add our not to

478
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,800
get our 1 and then we almost kill our 1

479
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,080
on the new curve and we keep doing this

480
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,350
all the way down until we've computed

481
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:47,470
371 to isogen is the product of which is

482
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,410
the is the large the large secret our

483
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,800
slow journey I should say that there's a

484
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,780
much faster way than this sort of this

485
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,790
is like the naive way in in the in the

486
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,440
gerund DeFeo and and Plouffe art paper

487
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,210
or the extended version AP they show a

488
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,980
much faster way but but the purpose of

489
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,420
this talk it's just to show that there's

490
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,920
two types of arithmetic that's going on

491
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,910
in s idh namely there's a lot of

492
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,200
arithmetic happening on a fixed curve so

493
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,150
when we when we're varying points on a

494
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,880
fixed curve and then we have to compute

495
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,990
a nice odd you need to get to a new

496
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,670
curve and do arithmetic on that new

497
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,740
curve so it's not only the traditional

498
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,570
ECC arithmetic that we're used to but

499
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,990
also this last large in the arithmetic

500
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,760
okay so the motivation for our for our

501
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,880
work was we looked at the the original

502
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,100
implementation the proof-of-concept

503
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,090
implementation that which was which was

504
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,200
really encouraging in terms of

505
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,550
performance but we wanted to know

506
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,190
whether we could securely deploy sid8 in

507
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,220
practice and I suppose one of the one of

508
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,450
the fundamental things we wanted to do

509
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,940
was to see if we could mimic be the

510
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,800
level of constant time side-channel

511
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,620
resistant software that we that we've

512
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,210
come to be able to implement in there in

513
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,670
the traditional number theoretic

514
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,550
settings so we wanted to sort of strive

515
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,810
for that same level of constant time

516
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,180
behavior and see whether this brought up

517
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,080
any new issues as far as as far as soid

518
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,400
age goes so

519
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,080
as far as performance goes we sort of

520
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,690
had three three improvements over the

521
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,880
over the original implementation but

522
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,890
I'll only briefly talk about one of them

523
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,380
today namely not number one if you want

524
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,180
to learn about the other two then come

525
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,250
up and talk to one of us or read the

526
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,040
paper so I'll talk about this projective

527
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,510
isogen ease and and the fact that we're

528
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,680
now working in p1 everywhere in one

529
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,310
slide so in a CDH as I said we we

530
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,690
usually move around with different

531
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,380
points on one fixed curve in s idh we do

532
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,350
that as well as move around with we move

533
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,430
around with different points on a fixed

534
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,260
curve and then we change curves and move

535
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,810
around on a new curve so the the this

536
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,640
contribution was sort of mimicking what

537
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,800
was already done in the e CDH case by

538
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,740
Montgomery and others which was to show

539
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,560
that instead of working with both the x

540
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,830
and y coordinates on a curve or rather

541
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,690
when you cast out into projective space

542
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,020
to avoid inversions you work with XY z--

543
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,050
that in p2 instead of working with all

544
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,580
three of those you can drop one of the

545
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,480
coordinates you can drop the

546
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,150
y-coordinate and just work in in p1 so

547
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,710
this is what Montgomery's showed you

548
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,660
could do very efficiently when the curve

549
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,110
is fixed in our case we wanted to do

550
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,320
that and to do the same thing when we

551
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,370
when we proceeded from curb to curb

552
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,730
around the eye so Janine graph so it was

553
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,650
particularly nice especially in the case

554
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,530
of Montgomery curves where instead of

555
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,660
updating these a and B coefficients from

556
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,180
curve to curve we decide to work we've

557
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,830
been projected ly to avoid inversions

558
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,750
and we realized that instead of working

559
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,570
with all three projected coordinates on

560
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,360
a curve like this we can again ignore

561
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,960
the B coefficient when when working in

562
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,130
the Montgomery form and the reason is

563
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,410
that the B coefficient all it does is

564
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,030
tell you whether you're on the curve or

565
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,920
it's quadratic twist and in the context

566
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,160
of s idh both of these things have the

567
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,320
same gain Darien so it's it's kind of

568
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,030
nice that we can ignore whether we're on

569
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,620
the curve or it's quadratic twist we end

570
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,000
up with the same shared secret even if

571
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,010
we ignore these these B computations so

572
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,230
the arithmetic of Montgomery on the on

573
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,820
the curves we're able to do a similar

574
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,900
arithmetic in the I so Janine in the I

575
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,169
so Jenny graph ok just quickly this is

576
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,090
these are the parameters we chose we

577
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,960
were striving for a 128 bits of security

578
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,640
against the best known quantum attack so

579
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,049
our prime is roughly seven sixty eight

580
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,690
bits in size this is our starting curve

581
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,299
that's public for everybody to know

582
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,380
here's the number of points on the curve

583
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,790
it's got an easy easy DLP we public

584
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,049
parameters these are the generators that

585
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:58,570
Alice and Bob have to know of each other

586
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,480
to evaluate their Asajj needs at their

587
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,490
secret subgroup or secret misogyny is

588
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,270
chosen by 48 by private keys their

589
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,710
public keys are 3-3 x coordinates which

590
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,860
represent the the exponents of the the

591
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,110
evaluated life slow journey and also

592
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,179
determine the evaluated curve the

593
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:21,070
details are in the paper and at the end

594
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,299
of the day they come to compute this

595
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:24,490
this common J invariant one element of F

596
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,270
P squared which is a 188 bias okay let

597
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,360
me quickly talk about performance so in

598
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,790
this this is our our performance

599
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,110
compared to the prior implementation

600
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,910
it's somewhere between two 2.5 and three

601
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,320
times faster than that work but I should

602
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,840
say that there's a there's a lot of

603
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,980
different things going on and namely

604
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,780
that the most important one is that this

605
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,630
work is is in constant time so the prior

606
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,220
stuff did a lot of inversions but was

607
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,200
was calling non constant time inversion

608
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,540
routines for that in our case we avoided

609
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,090
a lot of inversions because we wanted

610
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,740
them we wanted to compute them using

611
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,520
Fermat's theorem in constant time so a

612
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,890
decent decent saving over the the prior

613
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,270
work and just very quickly I thought

614
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,150
that one other thing that we thought was

615
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,740
really good to look at was to see how

616
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,590
this how this would perform whether with

617
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,530
a hybrid a hybrid scheme that was

618
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,980
incorporated classical ECC with post

619
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,120
quantum si bah

620
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,580
so the the motivation here is especially

621
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,799
because si D H is so young

622
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:33,070
we might want to pair this with with the

623
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,390
elliptic curve discrete log problem to

624
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,919
at least give us some sort of strong

625
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:36,679
classical Garen

626
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:37,730
see that these things not going to fall

627
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,629
to anything but a quantum computer and

628
00:26:40,629 --> 00:26:44,289
in heighten that the hybrid pace is very

629
00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:47,600
very attractive especially in the in the

630
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,460
terms of SI d h because you can do a lot

631
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,590
of co-chairing you've got all this

632
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,970
arithmetic lying around to do the

633
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,999
montgomery ladder on your on your super

634
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:57,590
single occurs anyway but of course for

635
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,100
the ECD LP we don't want we don't want

636
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,990
such a curve we want it to be to have a

637
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,299
hard a CD LP so it's as easy as just

638
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,009
changing one constant and using all the

639
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:10,610
same software and for very little for

640
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,960
very little overhead yeah you get a lot

641
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,490
more classical security based on a much

642
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,080
more long-standing problem which is

643
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,200
which is quite attractive all right I

644
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,309
thought I'd finish on a slide that

645
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:26,690
compares s idh to some of the popular

646
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,600
lattice primitives are out so this is

647
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,049
the performance of these are the

648
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:34,429
performance numbers taken from the paper

649
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:37,730
Frodo which which looked at implementing

650
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,509
a plane lwe like diffie-hellman analog

651
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:45,110
and so you can see the trade-off here in

652
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,369
the in the last column you've got the

653
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:47,659
size of the public keys and it shows

654
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:49,820
that SI DHS is significantly smaller

655
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,100
than these are the letters these are the

656
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,619
letter schemes but you show that we have

657
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:56,899
a quite a significant performance gap

658
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:59,690
here but what I should say is that these

659
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:00,919
numbers of these numbers are for the

660
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:03,999
plane C implementation of this work and

661
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:06,769
this is really favorable to the lattice

662
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,450
primitives for example our assembly

663
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,960
implementation is you know 14 or 15

664
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,850
times faster than our plane C

665
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,200
implementation and the speed-up on the

666
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,869
other cases isn't isn't anywhere near as

667
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:20,360
extreme so when you come to look at this

668
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,919
look at a hard core implementation of

669
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,210
these schemes it's sort of much closer

670
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,490
than this gap suggests but nevertheless

671
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,830
this is this is what it looks like it's

672
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,269
a trade off for small keys for a little

673
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:32,360
a little slower performance for a

674
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,129
ephemeral diffie-hellman I should give

675
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,529
some just finished by advertising that

676
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:37,879
there's a paper coming into a decrypt

677
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:39,679
I've got to stop paper coming to a

678
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,379
decrypt that's talking about public key

679
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:46,639
validation and there just got accepted a

680
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:48,559
as you picked by Galbraith at each on

681
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,860
ent

682
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,899
and so our library only supports

683
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:53,789
ephemeral aside eh there's some issues

684
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:57,120
with public key validation there thanks

685
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,389
very much
