1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,940
okay thank you very much do you hear me

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,130
that's just fine good yeah good moring

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,990
I'm very happy to be here very excited

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,140
to be here at Krypton I really enjoyed

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,759
the weather in Santa Barbara I enjoyed

6
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:21,890
it so much that two nights ago at the

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,630
annickap alone I got a bad sore throat

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,760
so I will try my best but if you don't

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,279
understand just raise your hand wave and

10
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:36,170
I will repeat good so in this work we

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,530
studied the quantum security of

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,350
classical encryption schemes before you

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,440
start shouting post quantum wait a

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,210
second

15
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,119
so just to fix the ideas I'm only going

16
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,729
to talk about symmetric key encryption

17
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:55,600
scheme or secret Keys encryption schemes

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,860
this is I mean there's nothing fancy

19
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,350
here it's one of the simplest

20
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,000
cryptographic primitives that you can

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,549
think of you just have one secret key

22
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:06,080
and then you have one encryption

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,320
procedure and one decryption procedure

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,020
each of them map respectively plaintext

25
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,060
to ciphertext and cybertek's to plain

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,640
text and this primitive is classic so

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,010
whenever you see the yellow box it's a

28
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,450
classic encryption scheme okay so what

29
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,310
can we say about the security of of this

30
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,620
encryption primitives so usually when we

31
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,450
model security of the schemes we have

32
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,180
something like this in mind so we have

33
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,610
some adversary and since we look at

34
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,920
computational security here we consider

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,360
the adversary to be bounded a

36
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,930
polynomially bounded machine and the

37
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,780
adversary interacts in a classical way

38
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,870
with the scheme and after some

39
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,060
interaction it breaks the security of

40
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,380
the scheme whatever it means so then

41
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,390
when we look at the security of the

42
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,460
schemes against quantum adversaries so

43
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,729
what what we usually do is we give the

44
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,549
adversary access to a quantum computer

45
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:12,670
so now we model the adversary as a

46
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,890
bounded quantum machine but the

47
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,530
interaction with the scheme is still

48
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,170
Seagal because this game is a classical

49
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,540
object and this is usually what we call

50
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,990
post quantum security now I would like

51
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,410
to show you why this might not be enough

52
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,230
sometimes so there might be cases where

53
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,569
you want to give a bit more power to the

54
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:38,590
adversary so usually what the model that

55
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,910
we have in mind is something like this

56
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,250
so we have an adversary and the others

57
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,500
are is trying to compromise the security

58
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,860
of some external target some user but

59
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,370
what might happen in reality is

60
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,580
something similar to this scenario so

61
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,290
the target of the adversary might be a

62
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,920
tiny encryption device using some fancy

63
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,220
technology we already have chips using

64
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,560
you know optoelectronics components and

65
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,819
optic fiber so one thing become more and

66
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,130
more like this people start having fun

67
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,830
and become creative so this is what

68
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,709
happens so what you see here is a

69
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:23,769
commercially available equipment for

70
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:26,590
performing fault analysis attacks on

71
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,870
chips so you know there are this crazy

72
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,519
hacker people having a lot of fun

73
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,420
shining lasers into your chip and

74
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,920
pouring liquid nitrogen on it and

75
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,230
changing the voltage of the electricity

76
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,959
and by interacting in with the device in

77
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,019
an unexpected way they can extract

78
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:52,390
information we should not be available

79
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,600
and this is this thing's was supposed to

80
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,700
be you know science fiction until I

81
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,859
don't know 20 years ago but nowadays we

82
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:02,079
have a whole branch of cryptography

83
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:05,829
devoted to designing systems resistant

84
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,930
to this kind of attacks so what we

85
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,299
advocate in this case is the following

86
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,519
quantum security beyond post quantum

87
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,140
security what we mean is that the

88
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,169
adversary might be able to get quantum

89
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:28,180
interaction with the classical device

90
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,480
this is this was our first motivation

91
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,310
but there are other scenarios where this

92
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,540
is this might happen so very briefly for

93
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,010
example you might consider the case

94
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,470
where a classical primitive is used as a

95
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,640
sub protocol or a component or of a more

96
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,550
complex or involved quantum protocol and

97
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,320
then it's not clear how the security of

98
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,990
the classical primitive combines with

99
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,270
the security of the role protocol this

100
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,470
is what's important in security

101
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,110
reduction you might also have this kind

102
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,620
of fort attack let's call it so we're a

103
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,590
honnest user wants to run a classical

104
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,250
algorithm hare quantum computer and then

105
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,320
at the end of the measurement at the end

106
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,320
of the computation measure the outcome

107
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,600
in order to have a classical result to

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,520
send over the internet or whatever and

109
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,040
then your adversary might temper and

110
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,130
interfere with the measurement operation

111
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,840
and be able to assess quantum

112
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,680
information before the measurement

113
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,180
finally you might also have obfuscation

114
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,150
so the adversary might receive the code

115
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,950
for performing encryptions in an

116
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,910
obfuscated form but then he might run it

117
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,210
on his quantum computer and then to some

118
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,370
extent it might be able to at least

119
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,150
partially you know interact quantumly

120
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,710
with the widow classical primitive so

121
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,450
this sounds strange we are not the first

122
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,070
one to consider this kind of of model in

123
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,600
particular I want to mention this work

124
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,040
by Bonnie and xandrie from 2013 where

125
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,350
they look at the security of encryption

126
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,300
scheme and of classical encryption

127
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,940
scheme and they model the fact that the

128
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,270
adversary could be able to perform

129
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,510
quantum queries of this form so instead

130
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,100
of asking for the encryption of one

131
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,750
message and receiving back the

132
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,830
encryption the adversary might query the

133
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,560
encryption Oracle on a superposition of

134
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,390
messages and get back a superposition of

135
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,530
encryptions so what's the situation so

136
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,080
far the situation so far so then the

137
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,760
results from their paper look as follows

138
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,070
so first of all if you try to define

139
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:50,939
reasonable or at least an intuitively

140
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:54,399
intuitively good notion of security in

141
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,789
this model what you obtain is a Ana chi

142
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:01,449
is an unachievable security notion then

143
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,069
what you can do is to obtain a

144
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:05,800
compromise so to switch to an almost

145
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,789
classical security notion and this

146
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:12,069
compromise works because you can show

147
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:13,689
that it's achievable and it's strictly

148
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:18,069
stronger then indistinguishability under

149
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:20,019
chosen plaintext attack which is the

150
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:23,139
standard that let's say the minimal

151
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:24,699
security notion that you consider

152
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,830
classically and the situation looks like

153
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,860
this so on one end you have equivalent

154
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,709
notions of indistinguishability and

155
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:35,379
semantic security for the classical

156
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:37,779
world on the quantum side you have a

157
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:39,399
very strong notion that you can not

158
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:42,069
achieve and in between somehow you have

159
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:44,699
this almost classical

160
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,439
indistinguishability notion so what we

161
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,979
do oops what we do is we extend this

162
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:53,829
framework and we complete the you know

163
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:56,740
that the framework for analyzing the

164
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,939
security of of encryption schemes by

165
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:03,399
defining a new security notion quantum

166
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,089
indistinguishability we show that it's

167
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:09,159
strictly stronger than other previous

168
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:10,869
notion we show that it's achievable and

169
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:15,249
then we show equivalent notions of

170
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:18,009
semantic security and let's see how we

171
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:20,740
do it so in this thing we shall be

172
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,449
anything indistinguishability is a

173
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:24,300
security notion for encryption scheme

174
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,069
where you have an adversary the

175
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:29,829
adversary produces two plain texts of

176
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:33,370
his choice the two plaintiffs are sent

177
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,458
to a Challenger and the Challenger

178
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,039
selects one of the true plaintext at

179
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,899
random without telling the adversary

180
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:42,938
encrypts it and sends back the

181
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,740
encryption to the adversary and we call

182
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,680
this the challenge phase the goal of the

183
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,380
adversary is to guess which one of the

184
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,339
two plaintext was encrypted click this

185
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:57,160
is a classical notion and also it can be

186
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,620
extended to a stronger notion which is

187
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,779
called indistinguishability under chosen

188
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:03,850
plaintext attack where we give the

189
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,250
adversary the possibility of performing

190
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,970
one learning phase before and after the

191
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,120
challenge faced by learning phase I mean

192
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,310
the adversary is allowed to query a

193
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,319
polynomial number of times the

194
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:19,360
encryption Oracle adaptively on

195
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,389
plaintext of his choice

196
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:23,889
so what Bonnie and Xandra did this

197
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:26,949
almost 1 - almost classical security

198
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:31,180
notion is they extend the security

199
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,779
notion to a quantum adversary where the

200
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:38,589
learning phase is now quantum but the

201
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:41,980
challenge phase is still it is the

202
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,199
classic so why is this so first of all

203
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:50,019
they show that this notion is a tree

204
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,569
bubble and if 3 it's strictly stronger

205
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:56,019
than the classical one it and you might

206
00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:00,990
wonder why don't why can't you just do

207
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,250
quantum indistinguishability phase as

208
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,560
well well what happens is that if you

209
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,990
try to do this in the more natural way

210
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,310
you obtain this notion which is

211
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:09,970
unachievable

212
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,680
it's unachievable because there is an

213
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,360
attack which is completely independent

214
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,670
of the encryption scheme that you

215
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,920
consider and it always allows the

216
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,750
adversary to distinguish the encryption

217
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,920
of difference at our positions if you

218
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,329
have questions I can show you later this

219
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:30,399
so yeah this notion is unachievable what

220
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,370
we did instead is the following so we

221
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,069
started from this consideration and we

222
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,819
looked at the implicit assumption that

223
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:43,480
you have to make in order to define this

224
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,779
unachievable notion and then we said ok

225
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,459
can we do something different I mean

226
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:52,720
whenever we we have to make a choice can

227
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,550
we can we do something different and by

228
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,550
looking at all the options we span this

229
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,639
tree of security definitions and then we

230
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,240
look at it so the by choice I mean I

231
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,579
don't know can we rule out some form of

232
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:10,480
entanglement

233
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,500
how can we give additional constraints

234
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,649
of the adversary so the first thing we

235
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:22,060
do is we cut off the tree we cut off the

236
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,880
branches which do not make sense because

237
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,769
some of these options are are not

238
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,310
compatible with each other from from

239
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,279
what is left we remove the notions which

240
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,500
are still unachievable because of the

241
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,260
same attack of the fully quantum notion

242
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,410
and then of amongst the few left

243
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,519
candidates we pick up the one which is

244
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,829
more it's more targeted to our security

245
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:54,130
model and I I don't have time to go into

246
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,230
the detail of how we do this but very

247
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,420
briefly just to give you an idea these

248
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,790
are the main differences with the

249
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,360
unachievable notion so in the

250
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,820
unachievable notion whenever you have an

251
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,949
encryption Oracle this is basically

252
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:12,540
assumed to be a gate like a quantum gate

253
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,980
embedded in the circuit of the adversary

254
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,810
and this models a scenario where the

255
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,300
adversary has almost complete control of

256
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,160
the encryption power of the encryption

257
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,190
device or in this case the target in our

258
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,940
case instead we look at this model so we

259
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,949
consider a challenger as an external

260
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:38,670
device as an external quantum circuit

261
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,639
and the adversary has some communication

262
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,449
channel with this Challenger so he can

263
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:48,220
query that the Challenger runs a

264
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,510
proposition of of encryption which is

265
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,370
more suited to you know a network

266
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,350
scenario where the adversary wants to

267
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,730
compromise some external target another

268
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,639
difference is the following so usually

269
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,690
what what you might consider is the

270
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,389
adversary selects one quantum state of

271
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,240
his choice this state is sent to the

272
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,339
Challenger the Challenger encrypts the

273
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:17,829
state and send it back we consider

274
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:20,860
something slightly different where the

275
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,329
adversary is not allowed to

276
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:25,399
quantum states directly to the

277
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:28,339
Challenger but he is only allowed to

278
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:31,069
select a classical description of a

279
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:33,889
quantum state then this quantum state is

280
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:36,230
going to be built by the Challenger

281
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,600
encrypted and sent back what do I mean

282
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,239
by classical description it's it's

283
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,489
nothing terrible it's I don't mean that

284
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,079
the adversary has to specify the

285
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,069
amplitudes of the state I only mean that

286
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:53,329
the adversary specifies the quantum

287
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:56,899
circuit producing the state why we do

288
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:59,899
this the reason is that classically

289
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,259
there is no difference between a message

290
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,149
and the classical description of the

291
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:07,220
message in the quantum world there is a

292
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,279
huge difference because the former I

293
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,589
mean if you can fiend up if you can

294
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:14,360
directly feed the message to the

295
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,189
Challenger you can entangle yourself

296
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,189
with the state and this is something

297
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:21,110
which we consider a bit unreasonable in

298
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,209
our scenario but we can get rid of this

299
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:26,350
well I will show you later

300
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,959
the last thing is usually when you

301
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,600
consider encryption operations this is

302
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,480
what what is done in this is the

303
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,549
canonical way of evaluating a classical

304
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:42,739
function as a unitary you you do it like

305
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:46,999
this because this allows you to revert

306
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:51,529
to invert the operation even if the

307
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:55,009
function is not invertible but in our

308
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:57,049
case we are not dealing with one-way

309
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:59,269
functions or anything like that we are

310
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:02,449
dealing with encryptions with by their

311
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:06,230
own nature they are reversible

312
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,350
operations so what you can do is this

313
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,079
type of operation instead so you can

314
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,739
simply encrypt on the fly you know that

315
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:21,980
the quantum register now these kind of

316
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,779
operations are very well known and

317
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:26,149
studied and you might know them as

318
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:29,689
minimal Oracle's and it is well known

319
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:32,299
that they are very different from what

320
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,490
we call type 1 in particular they are

321
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,269
more powerful because if you want to

322
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,490
build a circuit computing the type to

323
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,720
operation you need the secret key

324
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,619
despite this we can show that in our

325
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:48,399
model

326
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,199
they are both acceptable so by keeping

327
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,809
in mind this differences we define our

328
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:59,290
notion of quantum indistinguishability

329
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,269
under quantum cruising plaintext attack

330
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,790
it is easy to see that it's at least as

331
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,389
strong as the other achievable notions

332
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:09,429
but we can say more we can say that it's

333
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:12,360
strictly stronger and how do we do this

334
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,119
well consider the following scheme this

335
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:18,399
is a very standard encryption scheme

336
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,610
which uses a pseudo-random function to

337
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,889
generate a key for the one-time pad

338
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:28,600
basically it's a it's a the standard

339
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,029
construction that you probably know from

340
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:34,899
your textbooks and Bonnie and Zander

341
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:37,269
showed that as long as the PRF is

342
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:41,079
quantum secure this notion this scheme

343
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:43,959
achieves their security notion but what

344
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,269
we what we can show is that this scheme

345
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,600
is insecure according to our notion and

346
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,119
this is a consequence of a more general

347
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:54,819
impossibility result that we give which

348
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:57,069
covers a much broader range of

349
00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:59,980
encryption schemes the impossibility

350
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,399
result goes as follows so whenever you

351
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,439
consider an encryption scheme which

352
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,569
works by you know taking the plaintext

353
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:12,250
encrypting it and appending some

354
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,799
randomness independent of the plaintext

355
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:22,148
we say that whatever is not independent

356
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:24,490
of the plaintext is what we call the

357
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,240
core function of the cipher and we say

358
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,330
that a scheme is quasi length preserving

359
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,070
if the score function is a bijection

360
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,240
basically it means that the scheme does

361
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,380
not meaningfully increase the size of

362
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,559
the encryption in respect to the size of

363
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,460
the plaintext and there are a lot I mean

364
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,710
a lot of examples we have

365
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,789
like this so for example I keep spoiling

366
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:57,340
my slides I'm sorry

367
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,340
for example the gold rect scheme

368
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,860
one-time pads block ciphers in ECB mode

369
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,950
stream ciphers these are all all of them

370
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,440
are of this form and our impossibility

371
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,799
result is if you have a scheme which is

372
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,620
quasi length preserving then it cannot

373
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,580
be secured according to our definition

374
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,370
which is terrible because then you might

375
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,140
wonder okay what do you do with the

376
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,740
security definition what's the problem

377
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,130
here

378
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,309
the problem is that you know whenever

379
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,929
you have an encryption procedure this

380
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:34,419
works by mapping plaintext to a

381
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:36,850
ciphertext space in an unpredictable way

382
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:42,240
but for a quasi length preserving scheme

383
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,730
this mapping is actually a permutation

384
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,399
on a smaller subspace which is somehow

385
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:53,169
easy to identify so what happens now is

386
00:18:53,169 --> 00:19:06,909
that yes so you see if you have so you

387
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:09,610
have one plaintext this is mapped to a

388
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,270
ciphertext in this smaller subspace and

389
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,830
therefore if you have a distribution of

390
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,740
plaintext this is mapped to a

391
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,899
distribution on the smaller ciphertext

392
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:23,470
but keeping the amplitudes and now you

393
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,090
see the problem because if this

394
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:29,470
distribution becomes smoother also the

395
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,039
target distribution as spread as it can

396
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,159
be it gets smoother and smoother until

397
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,220
you arrive at you know the uniform

398
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,049
distribution and the uniform

399
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,850
distribution is mapped to a uniform

400
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,159
distribution of ciphertext in the target

401
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:47,700
space what does it mean it means that

402
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,809
there are quantum states quantum

403
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:54,899
superposition of messages which are left

404
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:57,340
unchanged by the encryption operation

405
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,429
and this is a consequence of the fact

406
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:02,289
that in the quantum world if you want to

407
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:04,750
encrypt one qubit you need

408
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,610
two bits of classical information we

409
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,610
have seen it at the talk by if Kay

410
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,430
before that for the quantum one-time pad

411
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,690
you need one bit

412
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,830
for the form asking 0 1 & 1 bit for

413
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:23,860
masking plus minus so these states are

414
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,240
easy to distinguish and then you it's

415
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,600
clear that you cannot reach satisfiable

416
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,260
security a security argument if you have

417
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,060
this problem how do we overcome this

418
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,020
problem well this is our solution we

419
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,480
consider an additional randomness space

420
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,390
next to the plain text space and we

421
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,630
merge the two spaces together at this

422
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,310
point what happens is that the mapping

423
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,770
of the quasi length preserving scheme is

424
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,470
broken in the sense that now you don't

425
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,540
have anymore this easily identifiable

426
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,550
subspace in particular now if you have a

427
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,430
uniform distribution a uniform supper

428
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,780
position of plaintext

429
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,220
this is mapped this is spread in a

430
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,530
larger space in an unpredictable way

431
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,500
depending of the of the randomness so if

432
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,450
you change the randomness it's spread in

433
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,950
a different way you change the

434
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,630
randomness again it's spread in a

435
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,440
different way how do we what do we do

436
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,870
with this well we consider a family of

437
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,610
quantum resistant pseudo random

438
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:37,960
permutations then our encryption key is

439
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,270
a permutation and it's inverse and when

440
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,190
we want to encrypt a message what we do

441
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,430
is we just so first we append some

442
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,350
randomness to the state and then we

443
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:52,360
encrypt and this construction is secure

444
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,300
according to our definition of course it

445
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,380
does not keep the size of the plaintext

446
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,360
but this is exactly what we need for

447
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,900
achieving this level of security and

448
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,800
yeah the idea of the proof is to

449
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,440
consider the mixer and the mixer state

450
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,740
coming out from the encryption okay so

451
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,650
just to sum up I'm just in time this is

452
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,190
the situation that we have now so we

453
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,220
have

454
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,890
we completed this framework for studying

455
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,110
the security of classical encryption

456
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,920
scheme in in the quantum world there is

457
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,820
more so first of all we show that the

458
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,160
assumption of the classical description

459
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,179
is not necessary we can get rid of that

460
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,650
because all of our results basically

461
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,559
holds even for arbitrary quantum states

462
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,830
the only thing is that this classical

463
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,840
description makes things a lot easier

464
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,520
and it's more reasonable in our in our

465
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,880
scenario where the adversary is not able

466
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,600
to to watermark somehow the Challenger

467
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,730
next what we do is we can show we can

468
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,330
extend our construction basically we use

469
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,820
our construction with some sort of

470
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,970
randomized the ECB mode of operation so

471
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,340
we can extend it to deal with messages

472
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,770
of arbitrary size so we are not

473
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,940
restricted to you know one block

474
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,140
depending on the size of the permutation

475
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,400
but we can deal with arbitrary messages

476
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,549
and finally some other interesting

477
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,520
directions to look at look at public

478
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,450
encryption everything should work fine

479
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,970
in theory but better be careful so we

480
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,059
haven't really looked at that CCA

481
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:49,690
security again cc1 should be trivial to

482
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,669
extend CCA through as much three here

483
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:56,590
and finally a patch a general patch to

484
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,360
transform

485
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,750
schemes security according to the almost

486
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,120
classical definition in two schemes

487
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,350
secure secure according to our

488
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,460
definition so this concludes my talk

489
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,780
thank you very much and if you have

490
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,480
questions

491
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,540
you
