1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,910
this is probably the only talk you're

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,809
gonna get hear from somebody who's

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,790
absolutely unqualified in terms of

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,169
academic background to speak to this

5
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:15,120
audience whatsoever

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,039
so I'm going to look here at some

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,920
history and trends together and try to

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,630
look at what I think kind of some of the

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,160
interesting research frontiers going

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,080
forward or going to be so if I just

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,880
start looking at the problem with just

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,950
doing a cryptographic operation

13
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,840
historically we were really limited in

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,250
the amount of computation we could do

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,219
and so you've got these various manual

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,489
schemes the Enigma the EM 209 various

17
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,499
mechanical sorts of cipher machines and

18
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,260
this limitation on computation really

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,510
limited security but when things scale

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,309
the as I think all of you know that

21
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,319
favors the defense from a cryptanalytic

22
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:51,359
perspective and makes offense really

23
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,760
hard so you go from single DES to triple

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,960
des it's only three times as much

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,719
computation 2 to the power 56 times as

26
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,640
much work to do the attack and so this

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,010
kind of scaling means that basically the

28
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,129
defense wins and I'm gonna make what is

29
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,350
it in one hand the absolutely most safe

30
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,520
prediction and kind of an interesting

31
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,890
one at the same time the triple aes-256

32
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,020
I think absolutely never get crypto

33
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,689
analyzed in terms of crap classical

34
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,460
crypt analysis so we've reached this

35
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,420
point where the algorithms have won and

36
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,340
obviously though if we map the winning

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,950
of the algorithms over to the real world

38
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,479
you can see just a huge number of

39
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:28,740
different breaches occurring and

40
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,259
security isn't going well in practice

41
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,060
despite the fact that we have these

42
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,740
algorithms that have won and you can

43
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,240
think oh well that's a security problem

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,009
we're crypto people things are actually

45
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,020
ok in the crypto world and no matter how

46
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,670
you look at it they're actually not ok

47
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,039
so if you're trying to protect a key

48
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,509
that's going to protect your Bitcoin

49
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,240
that's a pretty easy problem how to hold

50
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,890
a key so somebody doesn't steal it and

51
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,560
do maybe an occasional transaction with

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,170
it but the number of successes at

53
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,630
holding high-value keys versus failures

54
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,979
and the places where we actually get

55
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,049
data like if somebody steals your

56
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,880
Bitcoin you actually can see it in the

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,079
places where we get this kind of

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,670
feedback we can see that we're failing

59
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,530
terribly and even in the places where we

60
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,419
don't usually get feedback the leaks

61
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,979
coming out of the NSA are telling us

62
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,629
that we're failing in many of those

63
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:14,519
areas as well at least against that kind

64
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,890
of adversary so our

65
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,830
world is not a very very good one right

66
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,959
now so one of the places that I sort of

67
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,520
like to do is I like to look to other

68
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,860
fields and see kind of what's going on

69
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,600
there what the history is so if we go

70
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,580
back to the Middle Ages if you needed an

71
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,410
amputation or you needed a surgery of

72
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,570
some kind your physician wasn't gonna do

73
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,580
it to for you he was gonna stand you

74
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,980
over to a barber because the barber was

75
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,600
the guy that would go chop stuff off the

76
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,160
it the physician didn't want it didn't

77
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,650
want to deal with that that was people

78
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,480
screaming and messy and the patients

79
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,459
often died and so you had this divide

80
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,100
between the academic physicians and the

81
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,380
barbers who went off and actually did a

82
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,560
lot of the applied stuff and we are kind

83
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,150
of in this same era of history so if we

84
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:07,470
look at this I mean they practice right

85
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,480
now yields some really really bad

86
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,670
outcomes as some that are good even for

87
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,500
inexplicable reasons so you may be

88
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,360
getting the right outcome for reasons

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,430
that we don't really truly understand

90
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,340
why and if you looked at research I mean

91
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,130
I think at least the practice practice

92
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,780
people would say that research is really

93
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,910
painfully divorced from practice in many

94
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,739
cases not all and this has gotten a lot

95
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,660
better in the 20 years that I've been

96
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,340
involved in this community but it's

97
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,220
still a major issue and so you what you

98
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,959
end up happening is quite predictable I

99
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,940
mean theory is struggling with just the

100
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,840
messiness of reality and the theory

101
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,209
isn't applicable then because to the

102
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,100
real world and the practice then ignores

103
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,019
the theory because if you're a practiced

104
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,090
person and you attend a conference and

105
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,410
you can't even understand a single word

106
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,660
that was said you don't really gain from

107
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,010
that and if you started actually

108
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,510
implement you know the fully homomorphic

109
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,980
encryption algorithm that was just

110
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,299
presented that it seems like it might

111
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,100
solve your problem and you get your code

112
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,720
working correctly and then you just

113
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,970
realize that it's going to be many many

114
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,010
many centuries before anything returns

115
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,380
you haven't actually achieved anything

116
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:10,799
useful

117
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,600
so you just ignore all of that stuff and

118
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,228
so you get this gap and if you're a

119
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:18,180
practice person it's really frustrating

120
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,180
to go and read some of the kinds of

121
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,320
things that get written and if you're a

122
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,419
theory person you get so frustrated with

123
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:25,860
the kinds of questions that practice is

124
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,099
asking so but in in this in the same way

125
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:30,150
that you

126
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,310
well meaning people in the Middle Ages

127
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,440
trying to do their best practice has to

128
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,780
go on you can't just stop and say look

129
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,550
you've got a leg with gangrene in it

130
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,410
yeah the amputation is still probably

131
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,479
better than doing nothing you still have

132
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,669
to go and do your best to protect these

133
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:47,639
systems that people are using so I came

134
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,440
into this when this divide was something

135
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,729
even greater than it is today

136
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:52,080
you know if barbers can do surgery

137
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,940
pre-veterinary students can clearly do

138
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,040
cryptography and so I got curious about

139
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,840
cryptography discovered the sideout

140
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,300
crypt news group that the old people in

141
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,500
the audience will know what I'm talking

142
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,669
about and the young ones maybe not

143
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:06,810
discovered from there interesting things

144
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,220
and the Stanford engineering library

145
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,810
there were all of the proceedings of the

146
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,610
old crypto conferences and I went down

147
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,570
there and discovered all kinds of

148
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,870
interesting stuff and met up with Marty

149
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,370
Hellman in the Stanford crypto group in

150
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,169
parallel I had this problem called

151
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:21,539
tuition and again I shouldn't complain

152
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:23,130
now because it's gotten a lot worse but

153
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,539
I had to come up with enough money to

154
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:25,289
pay my tuition

155
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,210
I discovered that compared to working in

156
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,620
the food service Hall doing crypto

157
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,289
consulting was fantastic and worked for

158
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,289
RSA for a bit implementing things

159
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:35,340
discovered some issues like the rc4

160
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,000
related key problem kind of early on

161
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,410
also learned about patents for better

162
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,720
and for worse those of you who pay my

163
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,280
company licensing money probably wish

164
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,510
that I hadn't learned it but at the same

165
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,880
time those are an important way to be

166
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,889
able to monetize research despite all of

167
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,169
the warts in that process I also got an

168
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:53,849
interesting project that paid a lot of

169
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:55,349
my tuition working for Microsoft where

170
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:57,030
they were trying to do try before you

171
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,490
buy software and the CD format was

172
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,870
relatively new you could put lots of

173
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,760
programs on it the idea was you'd be

174
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,349
able to distribute a CD to lots of

175
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:06,479
people and then the people who had paid

176
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,520
for the software would by unlock codes

177
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,229
or perhaps you'd even have some trial

178
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:12,660
period first and so I probably broke 40

179
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,490
or so of these schemes over the course

180
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,020
of a few years and that paid my tuition

181
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,220
and the guy in the marketing department

182
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,570
thought it was great because he could

183
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,039
just send these things to me and I'd

184
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,840
send him back a little hack and so we

185
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,919
had this kind of thing that kept on

186
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,479
going and that basically paid my way

187
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,630
through school it also let me sort of

188
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,070
peek behind the curtain because there

189
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,990
was this idea whenever you're new to a

190
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,760
field you have this idea well gosh like

191
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,320
people who are doing this really must

192
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,419
know what they're doing they're you know

193
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,550
they're old they you know they give

194
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,650
invited lectures they're like you know

195
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,810
they've got to be some like sort of

196
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,529
wizard

197
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,329
behind the curtain and peeking behind

198
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:46,949
and seeing that even companies that were

199
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,529
doing as good a job as any were not

200
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:52,199
really sure what they were doing was

201
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,059
kind of an eye opening an interesting

202
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:55,859
experience and so when I finished my

203
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:57,869
biology degree Marty Hellman retired he

204
00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:59,579
kept sending me some projects that he

205
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:01,529
was no longer doing consulting that was

206
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,359
the seed capital for my company which

207
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:05,819
started out by doing services mostly

208
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,169
breaking stuff and then trying to

209
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:09,529
sometimes pick up the pieces afterwards

210
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,359
so there was a presentation at Stanford

211
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,299
I can't remember who gave it

212
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:16,259
introducing mainly linear cryptanalysis

213
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,239
which is relatively new but also talking

214
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:19,589
about differential cryptanalysis

215
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:22,139
and I thought it was kind of cool but I

216
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:23,729
went off and figured I'd go try to

217
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:26,369
improve this and implement it and make

218
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:28,649
it you know work as best I could and it

219
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,029
was really really frustrating because

220
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,699
the correlations were just terrible I

221
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,409
mean dealing with things that were you

222
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:36,719
know 2 to the minus 50 when all you've

223
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:39,299
got is you know a PC of this era wasn't

224
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:41,429
very fun and I couldn't get the attacks

225
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:43,649
to work but I had known from profiling

226
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:45,479
the code that I had written that the

227
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,579
there were these different non-constant

228
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:50,159
timing effects that were popping up

229
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,479
because sometimes the code will run

230
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,539
faster than other times and understood

231
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:55,829
the reasons why these were there and

232
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:58,189
that led to the timing attack paper that

233
00:07:58,189 --> 00:07:59,969
Benedict mentioned in the introduction

234
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:01,559
I'm not going to explain the attack here

235
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,569
because I think we've reached the point

236
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:04,679
where everybody in this audience knows

237
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:06,889
or if you don't you can find the paper

238
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:09,569
so but very very the one sentence

239
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:10,769
summary though is that given a whole

240
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:12,509
bunch of timing measurements from a

241
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:14,549
device with a key you can use some

242
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:17,299
statistical techniques to identify

243
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:19,109
correlations that can let you figure out

244
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:21,809
what that key is the implications of it

245
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:23,699
are maybe a little more interesting I

246
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,379
mean from just a practical perspective

247
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,779
you know this gave me the kind of strong

248
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:29,519
correlations that I wanted I mean the

249
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,379
kind of thing that I could go do and

250
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,000
play around with with the PC that I have

251
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,009
so this was enormous ly fun compared to

252
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:36,659
trying to make differential

253
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,339
cryptanalysis actually work against a

254
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,669
live cipher and there's some things here

255
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,860
that are also just when you look back in

256
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,929
hindsight just seemed just absolutely

257
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:48,629
incredibly obvious like that every

258
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,670
little tiny side channels can court can

259
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,410
expose keys I mean we have these

260
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,179
cryptanalytic techniques that we're

261
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:56,279
exploiting much much much smaller

262
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,750
correlations

263
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,130
and so when you get something strong

264
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,840
like the difference of you know many

265
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,570
clock cycles that you can measure that

266
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,910
that ends up being important from a

267
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,420
cryptographic perspective it also is now

268
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,880
I think obvious to people that the real

269
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,290
implementations that we have in the

270
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,880
world aren't these sort of tidy black

271
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,240
boxes where M comes in and C comes out

272
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,890
and everything just happens through some

273
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,900
completely opaque machinery that we have

274
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,120
no insight into but there are all kinds

275
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,380
of things going on inside there that

276
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,110
become important and also tied to that

277
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,660
optimization the the whole quest of

278
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,120
computer science to get the M translated

279
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,400
into the C as fast as possible actually

280
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,810
can make things a lot worse when you're

281
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,690
trying to worry about security and tie

282
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,040
to this then is the question of this

283
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,440
disconnect between the algorithm and

284
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,630
what its requirements are in the real

285
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,290
world against what you actually end up

286
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,850
what what the security assumptions

287
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,500
underpinning the strength of that

288
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,420
algorithm might be and so you end up

289
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,880
with these incorrect assumptions that

290
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,890
the implementer makes and there's not

291
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,200
even any language that we typically have

292
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,420
for expressing really what assumptions

293
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,040
there are and verifying it those

294
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,660
assumptions are met by an implementation

295
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,700
and then last of all is a theme I'm

296
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,100
going to talk on several times talking

297
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,750
really this idea that the cryptic

298
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,640
cryptography is a lot more than just the

299
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,620
algorithms and the implementation than

300
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,420
the algorithms in the mathematics it's

301
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,760
actually how you solve a problem for

302
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,130
somebody and I'll talk about that a

303
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,650
little bit more later so back to history

304
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,040
so started the cryptography research had

305
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,930
clients to where as having me do various

306
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,060
projects a lot of them were deploying

307
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,220
smart cards at this time and there were

308
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,960
some just crazy security claims being

309
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,730
made around how it taking out 15 million

310
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,830
dollars and this massive equipment lab

311
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,050
to actually break anything and you know

312
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,390
I had student loans still just out of

313
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,339
school I didn't have 15 million dollars

314
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:48,839
to go attack these the way you're

315
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,420
supposed to attack them so I said I took

316
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,640
on protocol reviews and started looking

317
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,960
at the protocols people were using and

318
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,330
they were horrible and you know there

319
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,160
were things like time memory trade-offs

320
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,050
against DES or places where you could

321
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,010
get you know a loss of identical

322
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,330
plaintext with many keys and if you

323
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,470
could break any key you could load

324
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,390
arbitrarily large amounts of money onto

325
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,730
it you know max that

326
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,590
using DES in ways where you could

327
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,240
actually use the same key for encrypting

328
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,890
chosen messages and break the Mac makes

329
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,690
all kinds of terrible stuff mean RSA

330
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,030
where you did a cert where you put the

331
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,020
public key inside just with no padding

332
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,430
whatsoever inside a slightly larger

333
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,590
certifying public key and many of these

334
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,560
systems had proofs of security you know

335
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,300
you know with big quotation marks around

336
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,920
it so lots of things were bad in these

337
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,450
kinds of things it was kind of fun

338
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,100
because again you could go out and make

339
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,360
these systems better see what's going

340
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,520
wrong but one of the other things that

341
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,230
you quickly find if you're working doing

342
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,700
analysis and practice is that as soon as

343
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,870
you break somebody's system they get

344
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,390
defensive and defensive means they deny

345
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,800
it the attack works so I had to go and

346
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,030
implement the attacks to show that I

347
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,980
could load money into these things

348
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,320
or break the break the protocol in

349
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,170
practice and when I did this I also went

350
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,610
and figured okay these guys surely have

351
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,200
read about the timing attack papers that

352
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,490
I wrote so they must have fixed that so

353
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,170
I looked for timing attacks on these

354
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,450
devices and they were just consistently

355
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,010
bad again I mean you could break RSA

356
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,770
through leaks of whether the result mod

357
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,770
P or my Q is larger and the CRT pin

358
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,810
verifies are still in lots of devices

359
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,580
one was a little comparator that runs

360
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,660
through and checks the number of

361
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,390
characters that match the other thing

362
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,830
you could do that you know he wasn't

363
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,390
cryptographically interesting but you

364
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,580
could see what the sort of decision tree

365
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,470
and the in the software was for commands

366
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,110
coming in so if you send a command byte

367
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,960
and it says and another one another one

368
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,180
it's an illegal command how long it

369
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,040
takes you to tell you that tells you how

370
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,650
many plausible bytes were submitted and

371
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,660
so you can find the subspace of all

372
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,610
commands that the thing can support and

373
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,590
so finding these undocumented testing

374
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,480
and backdoor commands was another thing

375
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,890
that just kept popping up so there'd be

376
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,470
the magic you know magic global password

377
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,090
for all the devices with a mem compare

378
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,570
on it and so finding a bunch of those

379
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,700
other issues like time to read time to

380
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,010
reset to reset counters so in a lot of

381
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,620
eeproms you first go through if you're

382
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,000
going to have a counter that the write

383
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,220
function will do a bit clearing

384
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,500
operation first and then it will go and

385
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,030
set the bits back in so if you have a

386
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,320
reset counter that says you're only

387
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,720
allowed to put a counter that says

388
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,520
you're only allowed to check a pin ten

389
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,220
times as a user well if you zero your

390
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,110
counter and then set the bits well if

391
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,430
you set a reset right in the middle the

392
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:24,780
counter

393
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,400
back to zero and we still see this

394
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,050
problem regularly today so this isn't

395
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,700
the kind of thing that's quote unquote

396
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,290
fixed it's just not cryptographically

397
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,720
interesting and we also did some glitch

398
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,330
attacks as well but again glitch attacks

399
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,280
we just cause the device to output its

400
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,990
entire memory space as opposed to

401
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,330
breaking the crypto in some more

402
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,850
mathematical sort of way so I was doing

403
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,190
these and I wanted better data so I went

404
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,870
off to Fry's Electronics and bought the

405
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,490
cheapest oscilloscope but they had I

406
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,870
think it's about two hundred and thirty

407
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:57,120
dollars you know CRT screen took I had a

408
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,780
RadioShack electronic project lab that

409
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,460
my parents had bought me who are

410
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,830
actually in the audience here today that

411
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,970
I happen to have laying around which had

412
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,370
resistors in it so I took some alligator

413
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,550
clips and stuck the resistor in on one

414
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,910
of the smart cards I had and instantly

415
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,700
could see keys so just one of those like

416
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,130
oh my gosh people just clearly haven't

417
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,770
ever had a cheap oscilloscope a resistor

418
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,450
and a cryptographer together in the same

419
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,060
room what an earth is going on here

420
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,040
you'd think that there was like some

421
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,660
reaction that would occur so you can see

422
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,460
all of those sorts of stuff even like

423
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,930
des which you might think okay you're

424
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,160
not going to instantly see that on an

425
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,630
analog scope but a lot of the software

426
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,490
implementations would do the C and D

427
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,990
shifts we've got this twenty eight bit

428
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,730
shift register so you shift the thing

429
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,470
the bit comes off the end if the bits

430
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,690
zero well you just do a shift if it's a

431
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,580
one you have to move the bit back in and

432
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,950
so you could see the des Keys falling

433
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,560
out as well and with des that we can

434
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,530
only do that at night because the CRT on

435
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,660
the oscilloscope has such a crappy

436
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,370
phosphor that if there was any light

437
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,740
coming in then you couldn't see it with

438
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,840
enough persistence so so this was a

439
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,610
problem so finally okay there's enough

440
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,350
stuff and braking here we went we spent

441
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,450
you know several thousand dollars and we

442
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,070
at this point was myself on Josh Jaffe

443
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,900
who is a actually a friend of mine that

444
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,960
I'd hired and I was my my first employee

445
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,130
so we went we got a digital storage

446
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,270
oscilloscope and this was like

447
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,190
absolutely amazing cuz you know we could

448
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,170
do stuff in the daytime now we were no

449
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,510
longer like vampires and so we could you

450
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,800
know this had storage we could see

451
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,630
one-time events we've managed to get the

452
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,090
data pulled into the PC this was a

453
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,980
picture from one of the press articles

454
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,140
and both oscilloscopes that we owned at

455
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,460
this time were carefully stacked in the

456
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,810
background to show much equipment we had

457
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,490
to give you a comparison until

458
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,050
you know the labs that had real real

459
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,380
equipment unless Josh and Ben who were

460
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,680
my co collaborators on this so at the

461
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,150
same time we did this major push on

462
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,040
countermeasures because you know when

463
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,810
you're seeing a new attack that's

464
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,160
causing all kinds of devices to fail

465
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,050
saying things are bad and not doing

466
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:55,950
anything about it

467
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,540
on one hand isn't useful and also

468
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,890
there's the question okay I've got a

469
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,089
company here I need to actually make

470
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,890
some money so that was one of the things

471
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,480
that we did was to find a little bunch

472
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,190
of patents yeah and I kind of regret I

473
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,690
never actually got around to submitting

474
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,279
a paper to conferences describing the

475
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,440
countermeasures we've came up with if

476
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,910
you want to kind of see what the sort of

477
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,070
muddled state of mind at that time was

478
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,510
though you can actually go and go and

479
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,000
see these things but in parallel we were

480
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,650
looking at smart cards and I actually

481
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,270
said broke breaking everything we tested

482
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,589
there was one smart card we couldn't

483
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:24,300
break and could we put it in the reader

484
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,550
and we wouldn't do anything at all it

485
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,020
turned out there was actually no chip on

486
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,820
it at all they had just put a little

487
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,890
piece of foil on and that was the first

488
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,050
smart card review that we came along

489
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,970
with we actually there is no security

490
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,470
problems that we were able to find in

491
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,290
the smart card this was a bank that was

492
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,910
trying to impress their customers with

493
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,260
their their new smart card technology at

494
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,910
the same time this came up there was

495
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,450
some fairly complicated questions that

496
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,430
were coming up here there were customers

497
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,020
we had who were panicked about the

498
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,390
problem they had you know payment

499
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,040
systems in the field including some

500
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,410
where you could in a non auditable way

501
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,390
load arbitrarily large amounts of money

502
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,270
into them and you know what do you do

503
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,709
and I was under NDA's and things got

504
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,900
complicated fortunately somebody at one

505
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,420
of our clients had briefed all of their

506
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,250
senior VPS about what to do if they were

507
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,709
asked about the issue and a reporter

508
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,449
asked a question that had nothing to do

509
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:20,040
with cryptography and the guy gave the

510
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,679
response about what this this power

511
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,359
analysis thing and the reporter realized

512
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,020
hey there's something kind of

513
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,720
interesting here and his name is Jeremy

514
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,000
I forget the names reporter's name but

515
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,740
he wrote an article in Australia and

516
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,540
finally that kind of allowed us to talk

517
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,110
about what was going on in retrospective

518
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,110
I don't quite know how long keeping

519
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,090
something like this quiet amongst one's

520
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,920
sort of clients and their inner circle

521
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,870
is the ethical thing to do and the

522
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,490
responsible disclosure discussions

523
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,800
around software obviously don't apply

524
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,550
always the same way to hardware like

525
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,320
these question last night about Philips

526
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,550
with their light bulbs it's another

527
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,980
classic example what what do you do here

528
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,540
when you have lots and lots of light

529
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,460
bulbs in the field and that's a lesser

530
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,140
issue than something where you have you

531
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,120
know a significant payment scheme where

532
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,890
large amounts of money can be can be

533
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,030
stolen so again in retrospect this is

534
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,380
absolutely completely obvious I mean the

535
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,890
idea that electrons moving around affect

536
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,240
your power consumption I mean they have

537
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,620
to come from somewhere and you can see

538
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,510
them coming in and that you're gonna get

539
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,670
eeehm emanations based on the movement

540
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,080
so I mean this is just this isn't even

541
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,970
like physics this is sort of pre physics

542
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,790
here and that these measurements are

543
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,170
correlated is secret intermediates mean

544
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,490
obviously these transistors are

545
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,700
processing your secret intermediates and

546
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,030
again same kinds of things around

547
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,810
cryptanalysis being able to use tiny

548
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,270
correlations I mean I still all the time

549
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,410
I'm running into people who think well

550
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,660
gosh I have a little tiny 80s circuit in

551
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,810
my giant big ASIC surely you can't pull

552
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,880
the key out from that and if anybody

553
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,200
who's in doubt about that the answer is

554
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,970
yes you can and you don't need strong

555
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,880
correlations to break Keys but even that

556
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,550
is not obvious to a lot of people who

557
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,880
haven't looked at the cryptography and I

558
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,650
think the most important thing though

559
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,840
that again it's obvious in hindsight is

560
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,640
that the strong algorithms are the

561
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,500
beginning of cryptography and not the

562
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,110
end of cryptography so I've been using

563
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,700
this sort of phrase obvious in hindsight

564
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,000
for a while and and part of the thing

565
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,310
that anybody who's a practitioner here

566
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,260
is going to be thinking well telling me

567
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,550
that this was obvious in hindsight

568
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,370
really isn't very useful because you

569
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,590
want to actually know in advance what

570
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,850
the problem is now it actually is useful

571
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,990
if you want to assign blame

572
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,090
but in aside from that it again doesn't

573
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,310
help you protect a system so the

574
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,870
question of why the problems aren't

575
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,060
obvious beforehand is one of the things

576
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,380
that we actually have to understand if

577
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,700
we actually want to make practice better

578
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,280
and the analogy that I like to think of

579
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,900
for this is one of fractals so if you

580
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,300
think of a system it's kind of like a

581
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,070
fractal and you've got these different

582
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,470
levels that you can look of detail and

583
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,410
at the very finest level of detail when

584
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,150
you stare at something it's absolutely

585
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,890
obvious that you may be looking at a bug

586
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,900
I mean if I give you the you know the

587
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,850
lines of code Apple had was going to go

588
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,370
to fail here now it's pretty quick for

589
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,809
you to understand that

590
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:07,149
this is the not the right way to

591
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:08,769
actually implement your certificate

592
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:10,480
verification so the individual

593
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,009
vulnerabilities are really obvious

594
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:13,840
especially if you have this sort of

595
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,970
n-squared amount of effort where you can

596
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,679
take every line of code in every

597
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,179
academic paper that has been written and

598
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:20,470
try to see whether there's a match

599
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,759
between the problem that might be in

600
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,320
that line of code and this academic

601
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,720
paper but the amount of human brain

602
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,549
power required to do that is absolutely

603
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:28,179
staggering

604
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:30,070
there's another view of the system where

605
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,080
you can step back and say okay let's

606
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,460
look at this whole system in its

607
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,409
totality you can actually get a pretty

608
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:36,850
good idea of what some of the risk

609
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,200
profile here is I mean if you're gonna

610
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,999
tell me that you're gonna go launch a

611
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:42,279
new Bitcoin exchange using the same

612
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,960
kinds of key management approaches as

613
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,970
some of the other Bitcoin exchange like

614
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,340
I can give you probably a pretty you

615
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,690
know within an order of magnitude

616
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,549
guesstimate that your risk is probably

617
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:53,769
pretty high that your your bitcoins are

618
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,179
going to get stolen now I have no idea

619
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:56,440
what your bug is going to be or which

620
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,139
employee is going to be the insider that

621
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:01,179
breaks you or what is going to go wrong

622
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:03,369
but I can understand very quickly that

623
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:04,960
the risk profile of what you're doing is

624
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,110
actually pretty high so if we step back

625
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,259
and look at there are three trends tied

626
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:12,820
to this that are really driving the

627
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,490
technology industry today we have

628
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,389
exponential growth in the number of

629
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:17,649
devices that we're making

630
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:20,379
we have probably also exponential growth

631
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,299
in the economic value of the data that's

632
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:24,820
going on those devices and through

633
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,529
Moore's law and related trends we have

634
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:28,480
exponential increases in the amount of

635
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,399
complexity of those devices so if you

636
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:32,080
put the bad guy hat on for a second this

637
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,269
means I have more targets more reward

638
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:35,769
when I break something and more

639
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:37,690
vulnerabilities so these three trends

640
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,389
together make the defensive job very

641
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:42,759
difficult and you can look at what

642
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,499
happens as the complexity of a system

643
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:46,840
increases that your odds of getting all

644
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,379
the bugs out fall off basically

645
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:51,429
exponentially so if I double the number

646
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:54,700
of lines of code I roughly square my

647
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,679
chance of being successful at getting

648
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,929
the bugs out if I assume that my number

649
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:00,369
of bugs is proportional to the number of

650
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:02,590
lines of code reality is usually worse

651
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,940
because you have these unintended

652
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,200
interactions that occur between

653
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,049
components if you look at the number of

654
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:09,669
interactions and you say that my bug

655
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:11,860
rate per interaction stays constant my

656
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,960
probability of success falls off at

657
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,759
those the fourth power and even worse

658
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,440
than that if you have a

659
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,210
you're number of engineers working on a

660
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,490
system doesn't scale with its complexity

661
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,840
or number of interactions so lots of

662
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,940
things work against you as systems get

663
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,980
more complicated and I will come back to

664
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,610
that in just a second

665
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,560
1924 there was the silver bridge that

666
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,630
was built over the Ohio River and it was

667
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,880
a really innovative design instead of

668
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,800
using steel cables they used

669
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,480
high-strength steel eye bars that you

670
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,060
can just kind of see barely on the you

671
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,650
know here so this isn't a cable you've

672
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,990
got chunks of metal that are holding up

673
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,480
the sides of this bridge and being a

674
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,340
crypto talk everything always of course

675
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,720
is depressing so you kind of know what

676
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,850
happens to this bridge and it collapsed

677
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,710
in 1967 and create awareness of what

678
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,840
structural engineers call fracture

679
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,000
critical components things were if they

680
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,270
fail something catastrophic occurs so

681
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,830
how many fracture critical components do

682
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,930
you think there are in a typical mobile

683
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,790
phone or connect the device today and

684
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,950
you start looking at papers like you

685
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,630
know the row hammer papers and the

686
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,640
number of software lines of code you

687
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,380
have and the things that you actually

688
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,720
assume working perfectly and you're

689
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,180
somewhere around maybe ten billion

690
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,650
fracture critical components in a

691
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,780
typical device right now now if we

692
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,240
continue scaling at Moore's Law which is

693
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,800
the doubling every 18 months which isn't

694
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,870
exactly right but good enough for kind

695
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,430
of an approximation it means that about

696
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,550
10 years worker and have a trillion

697
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,780
individual single points of failure in

698
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,940
the devices that we're making and you

699
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,260
might think well maybe we're not going

700
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,640
to scale that way but you look at things

701
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,460
like the coming of AI and its use in

702
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,920
computer systems we may actually end up

703
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,870
scaling faster than that rather than

704
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,790
slower than that

705
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,200
now this defenses defenses we've got

706
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,000
today have failed to scale to the

707
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,130
problem that we have right now in time

708
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,980
and when you start looking at these more

709
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,810
complicated devices and these connected

710
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,550
things we're actually taking a problem

711
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,170
that we're failing at right now and

712
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,390
we're making it orders of magnitude more

713
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,700
difficult for ourselves so things like

714
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,950
the question how sophisticated the

715
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,020
vendors you know Philips with they're

716
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,280
connected light bulbs I already talked

717
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,630
about you know they are pretty

718
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,160
sophisticated in terms of their security

719
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,830
understanding compared to a lot of the

720
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,630
vendors that are currently making

721
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,120
devices that are not connected and you

722
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,800
look at the product life span we're

723
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,750
going from disposable connected products

724
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,700
to very long-term products

725
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,080
we're looking at devices where you know

726
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,360
I'm willing to spend an hour making sure

727
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,520
my PC works properly I'm not willing to

728
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,200
spend an hour to make sure every light

729
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,730
bulb in my house works properly

730
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,970
I'm tolerant of my PC or my phone having

731
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,440
some issues because it's a very valuable

732
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,900
thing to me an individual light bulb is

733
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,240
not nearly as valuable you know my my

734
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,770
car has a much more physical impact on

735
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,990
my world than my mobile phone today so

736
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,060
the potential for damage again is

737
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,130
changing and the number of software

738
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,290
platforms we have with iOS and Android

739
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:06,100
and PC and Mac may be on on traditional

740
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,450
computing devices in Linux you know

741
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,070
maybe five or six of them we're gonna

742
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,930
start having this huge proliferation of

743
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,880
different firmware images that aren't

744
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,380
even really platforms you're gonna have

745
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,870
firmware version 1.7 that somebody

746
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,820
cranked out for that particular release

747
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,710
of light bulbs and it may not even have

748
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,230
a traditional OS and all the stuff

749
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,940
attached to it and the on device

750
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,500
security tools that you're used to so

751
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,850
all of these things that we've been able

752
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,480
to do to manage security and make the

753
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,120
problem even be survivable we're going

754
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,150
to start losing a lot of those tools so

755
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,400
what do we do and I'm going to look at

756
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,220
sort of two parts to this here one which

757
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,260
is focusing on outcomes and one looking

758
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,790
at some some foundations that we need to

759
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,390
build so when you give a talk one of the

760
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,470
first things you want to trying to do is

761
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,300
figure out what is absolutely everybody

762
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,730
agree on well we kind of agree that the

763
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,350
probability of cryptanalysis for our

764
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,450
best algorithms is very small and the

765
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,860
probability of a mistake is very large

766
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,140
so I think everybody wants to narrow

767
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,580
this gap and there are sort of two

768
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,640
general approaches so the FBI has one we

769
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,900
make the probability of cryptanalysis

770
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,940
really really huge and this gap goes

771
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,420
away that's not what I think we should

772
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,640
do I think we need to try to figure out

773
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,350
how to get this probability of mistakes

774
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,440
to be a lot smaller so we need to start

775
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,060
thinking of probabilities not

776
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,670
certainties and this means that a proof

777
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,400
is no longer a proof of anything it's

778
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,110
evidence you don't have a hundred

779
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,440
percent confidence in a proof itself

780
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,140
because people can make mistakes I have

781
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,880
certainly had math exams where I was

782
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,680
told to prove something and I came up

783
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,540
with a proof and it was wrong and we've

784
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,760
had errors and proofs before you can

785
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,440
have automated proof checkers they can

786
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:44,620
have

787
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,470
bugs but even much more important is

788
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,480
that the assumptions and the relevance

789
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,370
of that proof to the real world may be

790
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,770
very tangential and in many cases a

791
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:56,050
proof that gives you confidence that is

792
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,720
misplaced is a dangerous thing in fact

793
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,010
generally if you look at the history of

794
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,930
cryptography the place where things

795
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,570
really really go wrong is where you

796
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,280
believe something is strong and it's not

797
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,540
one other thing to keep in mind about

798
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,490
proofs when you're looking at a real

799
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,750
world that's got this exponential

800
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,730
scaling is that you may have some gap

801
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,860
between your proof and reality but the

802
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,600
size of that gap typically scales

803
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,429
exponentially as the system's get more

804
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:23,559
complicated so if you say well okay I'm

805
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,480
assuming that the software is correct if

806
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,640
I have 50 lines of software that has a

807
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,130
certain probability of being a correct

808
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,900
assumption if that's the software

809
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,610
complexity scales up to five million

810
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,230
lines of code I have a very different

811
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,059
probability of being able to actually

812
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:39,850
achieve a correct assistant that meets

813
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,640
that correctly so if you look at the

814
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,830
different kinds of systems that we've

815
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,780
built there's a question what is the

816
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,010
probability we're actually going to get

817
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,530
the outcome we desire and certainly we

818
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,970
can see in retrospect that for the

819
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,650
Germans with the Enigma machine that

820
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,210
they did not get the outcome they

821
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,330
desired or the Bitcoin exchanges or you

822
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,040
know with our operating systems and you

823
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,170
know I am with SSL three is the lead

824
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,820
author and that certainly there were

825
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,460
some surprises there that you know the

826
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,300
the protocol

827
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,610
on one hand did certain things fine and

828
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,929
certain but the little things that you

829
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:15,010
miss are critically important from a

830
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,750
security perspective and we have a

831
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,480
history in our community of being

832
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,570
massively overconfident and there's some

833
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,330
reasons why this happens it's partly

834
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,250
that our brains are tricking us because

835
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,440
when we think we understand something

836
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,210
like I think I understand transistors

837
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,309
that doesn't mean I actually understand

838
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:35,290
operating systems even though I can map

839
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,059
the operating system sort of some have

840
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:38,559
some model in my mind that connects

841
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,670
these two together but you have these

842
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,590
emergent properties that make you feel

843
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,390
comfortable with the things you

844
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,190
understand and you tend to be a lot more

845
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,740
blinds to the things that you don't the

846
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,000
same thing happens in crypto you feel

847
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,350
like you understand an algorithm so you

848
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,970
infer that you might understand the

849
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,530
protocol built with those algorithms but

850
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,290
really we don't and when you go for a

851
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:58,269
protocol to an implementation

852
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,889
an executable to some you know

853
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:02,649
absolutely critical use case that the

854
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:06,369
world needs that that connection gets

855
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,519
very very hard and we our brains tell us

856
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,229
we understand it when we don't and we

857
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:12,239
get overconfident

858
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:15,070
so one of the important research

859
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,749
questions here is to ask the question is

860
00:29:16,749 --> 00:29:19,149
what does cryptography for fallible

861
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:22,149
humans look like not cryptography for

862
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:25,809
people who are you know working in a

863
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:28,779
world of just pure mathematical symbols

864
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:30,789
but in a world where we have you know

865
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:33,039
biological people who are building

866
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,959
things in the languages we have today

867
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,639
with the transistors we have today and

868
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:38,529
one of the things that you very quickly

869
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:40,179
realize is that our goals need to be

870
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:42,459
around safety and assurance we don't

871
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:44,799
generally need to be 10 times faster we

872
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,320
need to be 10 times fate safe safer and

873
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,239
we need to come up with systems where a

874
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:52,289
mortal practitioner can usually succeed

875
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:55,119
if you look at medicine most of the

876
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,619
doctors who are practice practicing

877
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:58,359
today are not absolutely

878
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,919
state-of-the-art researchers they're

879
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,619
ordinary enough GPS working in ordinary

880
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:03,879
enough environments and there are

881
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:05,709
certain things that they can do that

882
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:06,909
mean that for most of the patients

883
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:09,489
walking through they helped more than

884
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:11,320
they heard and we need to be able to get

885
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,969
to the point where we can do that and it

886
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:13,899
means making some pretty different

887
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:15,820
assumptions and different metrics and

888
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,679
different trade-offs you need to look at

889
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,320
implementation risk is a critical part

890
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,299
of what makes a system better than

891
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:24,190
another system you how many lines of

892
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,259
code and especially use cases are needed

893
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,929
how do we achieve high test coverage for

894
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:31,359
something I mean if you have a security

895
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,700
critical branch that needs to be done

896
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,559
correctly by software that the attacker

897
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:37,869
can tickle but the defenders tests

898
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,089
harness won't actually Explorer

899
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:42,099
correctly that's something with a very

900
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:43,929
high likelihood of being a failure and

901
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,849
to go build a system that has that kind

902
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:47,440
of design property in it is something

903
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,059
where you're putting the ultimate people

904
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:50,950
who are using it at a significant amount

905
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,229
of risk we need to figure out what you

906
00:30:53,229 --> 00:30:55,299
know how to build safety margins and

907
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:56,979
what they mean if you look at this

908
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:59,049
building around us if it was designed by

909
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:00,519
computer scientists they would have

910
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,109
optimized out almost all of the

911
00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:03,309
structural supports because they are

912
00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:05,919
clearly unnecessary but when the

913
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:06,789
earthquake comes

914
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:08,619
we're actually would like to have those

915
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:11,259
there and if you think about in your you

916
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:12,010
know how much

917
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,560
money have you spent indirectly paying

918
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,780
for completely unnecessary things like

919
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,610
airbags and redundant structural

920
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,680
supports you're spending hundreds if not

921
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,900
thousands of dollars a year for things

922
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,690
like safety and yet we're in a world

923
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,250
where you walk up and you say look I'm

924
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,200
gonna add two cents to the price of this

925
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,630
thing to make you safer people say well

926
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,430
I don't know if I can afford a two cent

927
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,350
budget yet the amount of Steel that went

928
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,660
into this building is probably two cents

929
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,000
for each of us just sort of amortized

930
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,460
over the time that we're here it means

931
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,200
we have to be very different than we're

932
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,940
currently being about our terminology

933
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,280
and our understand ability to other

934
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,290
stakeholders so when you write a paper

935
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,240
which is in math terminology and you

936
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,100
hand it over to a programmer there's a

937
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,320
big language gap there and if you can't

938
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,760
clearly understand what it means in

939
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,680
terms of bits and bytes you don't have a

940
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,500
system that is safely implementable you

941
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,000
have a an interesting mathematical

942
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,260
construction but you don't have

943
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,520
something that should probably be used

944
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,740
in the real world it means we have to be

945
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,870
very precise about things like what is

946
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,970
the internal state that you're going to

947
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,070
track what are the computations you do

948
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,330
what are the messages that come in and

949
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,410
out you know when I think about

950
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,990
protocols in the post SSL world having

951
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,970
had lots of scars that are covered up by

952
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,690
my shirt here from having designed that

953
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,610
you know if you have a I've learned that

954
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,410
if your protocol isn't completely clear

955
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,510
from the message perspective the

956
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,830
computation perspective and the state

957
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,430
perspective

958
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,870
whichever one of those three was

959
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,060
ambiguous or underspecified tends to be

960
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,320
the place where the security problems

961
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,660
are lurking so we need to document those

962
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,920
things with the document our assumptions

963
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,260
a lot better and then you get questions

964
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,210
like best practices and now they're

965
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,380
probably a bunch of you in the audience

966
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,580
who nothing now this is just a practice

967
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,770
guy best practices has nothing to do

968
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,660
with what I'm doing but if you actually

969
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,770
want your stuff to have real-world

970
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,540
impact we actually have to figure out

971
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,880
how to translate into what the real

972
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,190
world actually can use like what should

973
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,590
a cryptographic API look like and if you

974
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,210
look at pkcs 11 is not what a

975
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,180
cryptographic API probably should look

976
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,500
like I think we can do better than that

977
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,930
but I don't think we know even from a

978
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,550
research perspective what are the

979
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,190
properties that we can reasonably

980
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,990
achieve what does it look like I mean

981
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,440
giving somebody just raw mod exp as your

982
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,600
sensitive API and assuming that you've

983
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,160
got your untrusted thing they can do a

984
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,580
mod exp with a secret

985
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,100
he doesn't feel good I think we can do

986
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,020
better than that and we have to

987
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,130
ultimately figure out how to get things

988
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,530
to be more resilient so this is actually

989
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,620
a really really important graph if you

990
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,110
think about it if you were to go back to

991
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:42,740
the 1960s and had the 1960s aviation

992
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,430
safety success rate today several of us

993
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:50,510
would be dead but through time there has

994
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,150
been exponential improvement in the

995
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:57,140
safety of air aviation travel if you

996
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,240
were to draw a similar plot I don't have

997
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,560
good data for it but looking at the

998
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,020
safety of electronic systems we're

999
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,910
probably getting exponential increases

1000
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,410
in the danger that we're exposing people

1001
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:10,280
to and this means that in order to do

1002
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,050
this there were a couple of things that

1003
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,030
the aviation industry figured out pretty

1004
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,920
early on first of all that they had to

1005
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,120
build a culture of safety

1006
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,949
it wasn't about whether it was possible

1007
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,659
for the plane to get from point A to

1008
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,820
point B it's what's the probability that

1009
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,679
plane fails to get from point A to point

1010
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,139
B it also required realizing the

1011
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,730
aviation was a whole lot more than just

1012
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,940
aerodynamics because questions of what

1013
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,590
does the user interface in that cockpit

1014
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,870
is an issue that gets a huge amount of

1015
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,060
thought because if that user interface

1016
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,370
is something that a somewhat distracted

1017
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,949
tired moderately competent pilot is

1018
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,389
going to make a mistake on when one

1019
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,790
component fails that's not a good thing

1020
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,020
because there going to be people who are

1021
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,840
going to make that mistake so if we want

1022
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,730
to step back and say what can we do to

1023
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,469
try to make this situation better

1024
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,780
besides just bemoaning the scope of the

1025
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,690
problem my argument here and my thesis

1026
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,640
for the rest of my talk or the final

1027
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,650
part of it is that we actually have to

1028
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,210
be able to make foundations that can

1029
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,440
bear what I term is the security

1030
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,120
pressure so when I think about a

1031
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,070
security system there's a certain amount

1032
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,080
of desire attackers have to break it

1033
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,520
there's a certain amount of work they'll

1034
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,530
put into it and it's hard to sort of

1035
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,150
quantify this but you can get a sense of

1036
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,860
how much pressure is going to come to

1037
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,600
bear on the system and if it can't

1038
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,920
withstand that pressure and it fails

1039
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,900
then you end up with the attacker

1040
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,760
winning and some catastrophic outcome

1041
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,960
generally for the person who's on the

1042
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,380
defense

1043
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,210
conversely if it can take the pressure

1044
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,040
then you end up with a system that can

1045
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,680
function pretty well in the real world

1046
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,610
so what do we need to do to make

1047
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,900
foundations here that are strong enough

1048
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,150
now we know that at the lowest layer we

1049
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,260
have crypto algorithm

1050
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,050
that look pretty good and there we

1051
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,840
understand this problem we have the

1052
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,150
basic building blocks that we need you

1053
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,670
know ciphers hashing signatures key

1054
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,710
agreement I put secret sharing and

1055
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,090
threshold schemes on here as well and

1056
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:56,150
they're vastly underused but if you pick

1057
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,520
the just basic building blocks that you

1058
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,290
need to construct this building around

1059
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,850
us with we have those mathematical

1060
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,950
constructions now there's one little

1061
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,900
asterisk around quantum resilience not

1062
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,150
being as boring as the practitioner

1063
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,460
would like although of the things that

1064
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,950
are causing fatalities in the near term

1065
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,350
quantum attacks are pretty low on that

1066
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,450
and we don't have scaling and cubits at

1067
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,550
this point so it's an important issue

1068
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,750
and I think it's one that's being dealt

1069
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,570
with in the right way but it's not the

1070
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,180
most important issue that the world

1071
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,910
faces in terms of cryptographic security

1072
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,370
at this point so we had to solve basic

1073
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,650
crypto problem now protocols and

1074
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,410
constructions get a lot yeah so actually

1075
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,900
I should say we we really understand how

1076
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,320
to build strong protocols in theory the

1077
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,600
theory of how to do it is great but when

1078
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,370
you actually map to the real world

1079
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,410
messiness and this is the distance

1080
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,800
between the middle-aged physician and

1081
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,040
the barber you have a much much Messier

1082
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,140
set of constraints that don't actually

1083
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,510
map always very comfortably back to the

1084
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,130
theory we are not really at the point

1085
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,930
where you can easily say oh yeah it's

1086
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,820
really easy to go make a protocol that

1087
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,990
will deal with all of these sort of

1088
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,060
real-world things and some of these are

1089
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,290
things where you have cryptographic

1090
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,150
failures that result some of them result

1091
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,410
in other problems but if you look at

1092
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,200
issues like compatibility between

1093
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,940
versions and or you know ECC curve plura

1094
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,380
proliferation right now is an absolute

1095
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,970
security problem because it means you

1096
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,760
can't go and hardwire a nice single

1097
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,530
state machine for your accelerator you

1098
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,000
have all these different choices which

1099
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,910
means you end up with the security

1100
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,080
surface area of your system growing

1101
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,850
dramatically you have certificates in

1102
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,560
taxes if anybody needs to break

1103
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,750
something go look at the x.509 parser

1104
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,360
because nobody who actually like had a

1105
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,310
choice in what jobs they were going to

1106
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,620
be assigned has to get assigned the

1107
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,200
x.509 parser so there's always a bug

1108
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,880
there if you need to go find a bug so

1109
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,200
that's just a little hint if you ever

1110
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,760
need to break something you know

1111
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,100
we often ignore the economics and in the

1112
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,320
ssl 3 protocol i'd made the assumption

1113
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,980
to be 1 2 3 root cas it never even

1114
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,140
occurred to me what the economic forces

1115
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,650
were going to be that led us into the

1116
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,690
non cryptographic disaster that we have

1117
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,060
with a whole lot of cas who managed the

1118
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,610
roots to the root keys to the kingdom

1119
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,650
who have economic incentives that are

1120
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,020
actually diametrically opposed to

1121
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,240
security in many cases you know side

1122
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,710
channels implementation complexity

1123
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,330
there's a lot of these things where when

1124
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,680
you actually ask the question of how do

1125
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,690
you go make a protocol where somebody

1126
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,980
can actually verify that the

1127
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,920
implementation works in practice it

1128
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,780
becomes a much much thorny or problem

1129
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,340
but we've made a huge amount of progress

1130
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,830
here but it's one where we we still have

1131
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,410
I think a ways to go to deal with many

1132
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,850
of the real world cases some of them

1133
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:44,090
work work much better but if I ask the

1134
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,280
question you know it's been 20 years I

1135
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,910
think ssl/tls has probably been the most

1136
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,640
reviewed protocol family that we have

1137
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,340
today do we actually understand this or

1138
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,750
is there going to be another surprise at

1139
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,010
some point I'm not sure I'm comfortable

1140
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,790
promising that there won't be another

1141
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,800
surprise or another way to ask the

1142
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,240
question is if somebody needs to build a

1143
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,490
system that they cannot upgrade can they

1144
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:10,610
put TLS 1.3 in and be confident that

1145
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,110
that's going to last for the next

1146
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:15,080
hundred years and I'm not sure I can say

1147
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,050
yes to that either so we need to be able

1148
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,850
to get to the point where and we can't

1149
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,950
we can tell a practitioner that it is

1150
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,540
okay to go ahead and do this and that

1151
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,950
you're not taking a unacceptable risk by

1152
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,210
committing to something and if you tell

1153
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,010
the practitioner no you can't rely on

1154
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,660
any of your cryptography well they're

1155
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,640
gonna then go around and hard-code their

1156
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,560
own software update mechanism which is

1157
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,550
going to create a whole bunch of new

1158
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,560
risks so there's not a question where

1159
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,610
you can say look I'm going to punt on

1160
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,650
this problem and tell the person to be

1161
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,450
totally flexible and actually get a good

1162
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:48,710
outcome from that either now the I call

1163
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,090
the two trillion dollar question in many

1164
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:53,180
ways it actually is where how can we

1165
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,010
actually enable secure computations to

1166
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,100
be actually done in the real world and

1167
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,500
this is really a prerequisite for all of

1168
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,110
the fancy cryptography that a lot of us

1169
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,620
are working on and when we look at what

1170
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:06,860
that

1171
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,230
happening today in practice there are

1172
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,180
these massive massive failures for even

1173
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,340
very simple use cases you know can your

1174
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,620
web server hold your private key for

1175
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,870
your SSL session in a way where somebody

1176
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:21,650
can't steal it can you hold the the key

1177
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,210
for your Bitcoin in a way that somebody

1178
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,130
won't actually steal and you look at the

1179
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,660
empirical evidence that we're getting

1180
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,190
and the answer is that the failure rates

1181
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,980
here are not just significant they're

1182
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,180
very very very high so one thing you

1183
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,230
might be some of people will be saying

1184
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,690
oh we will solve this through fast fully

1185
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,340
homomorphic encryption or some kind of

1186
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,500
obfuscation scheme you know some miracle

1187
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,290
occurs that won't help us because you

1188
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,850
still need secure compute I mean it

1189
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,440
doesn't you know you've got to have a

1190
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,360
trusted compiler to go make your system

1191
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,280
that has to run in some computer you

1192
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,260
need to have somebody who's talking to

1193
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,240
the fully homomorphic encryption system

1194
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,530
that needs to generally know some

1195
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,240
secrets to do something useful and

1196
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,440
you're gonna create a whole lot more

1197
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,630
buggy code so there's no miracle that's

1198
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,790
going to save us through some kind of a

1199
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,560
new primitive that comes along we're

1200
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,030
also not gonna have a miracle where

1201
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,010
somebody finds the last bug in Windows

1202
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,110
and we're all good here because the new

1203
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,460
product will come along it'll be

1204
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,810
obsolete there'll be new bugs that get

1205
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,190
added I mean there are bugs being

1206
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,450
created faster than they're being

1207
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:20,000
retired still so even if you're trying

1208
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,250
to bail out the water with a bucket the

1209
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,710
river is still pouring in faster than

1210
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,990
we're emptying the lake and again maybe

1211
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,580
artificial intelligence can come along

1212
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,560
and find all of our bugs and then we get

1213
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,570
the singularity and you know that's

1214
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,360
probably not good either and I mean

1215
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,130
actually I mean I think actually AIS are

1216
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,260
super important but I don't think

1217
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,220
they're going to save us from our

1218
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,220
problems either so then maybe you can

1219
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,560
say okay how do we take where we are and

1220
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,180
what do we do to sort of get towards

1221
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,680
having a place so we can run secure

1222
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,600
compute and there's the sort of

1223
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,610
traditional computer science approach

1224
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,310
which is you scale things bigger and

1225
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,960
bigger within one security perimeter you

1226
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,690
put SGX into your Intel processor and

1227
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,940
you assume the processor is good and you

1228
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,800
pack more and more security stuff into

1229
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,330
this big perimeter your ring zero code

1230
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,310
keeps getting larger and larger and

1231
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,200
larger and this is sort of like this

1232
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,330
serbian ammunition depot that we saw

1233
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,980
where you pack more and more stuff in

1234
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,630
and when you put more things in there

1235
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,800
odds of failure go up and the

1236
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,240
consequences of failure go up and I

1237
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,920
believe it was this Depot that exploded

1238
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,720
in an absolutely gigantic

1239
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,160
explosion shortly after this picture was

1240
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,980
taken or you do like what the US does

1241
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,390
zoom we're storing large amounts of

1242
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,160
ammunition this is a satellite picture

1243
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,960
of the Black Hills ordnance Depot and

1244
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,040
you have lots of little security

1245
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,290
perimeters that can survive can live and

1246
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,570
die independently of each other so you

1247
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,030
have small much more survivable failures

1248
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:41,390
that can occur so the architecture that

1249
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,300
I'm advocating for here and it's one

1250
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,590
where we start building little bits of

1251
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,810
security and this is based on the

1252
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,910
assumption that our current first of all

1253
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,940
and do these in the additive manner so

1254
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,260
starting with the assumption that our

1255
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,450
legacy platforms that we have are too

1256
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,160
complicated to debug we will not get the

1257
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,350
bugs out of them they will remain this

1258
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:03,440
sort of cesspool that we have today and

1259
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,720
that they're too valuable to abandon so

1260
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,760
we can't run away from them so weak but

1261
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,490
we can add stuff and in fact it's

1262
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,740
possible to put on a chip for into a

1263
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,780
larger device a secure thing that runs

1264
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,280
separately and manages your more

1265
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,160
important things than the Pokemon go

1266
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,630
game that happens to be running on the

1267
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,700
main processor and hardware in this

1268
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,950
regard is absolutely unique in the sense

1269
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,870
that it is the lowest level so if you

1270
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,060
try to go do something nice in a piece

1271
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,190
of application software there's always

1272
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,660
these lower levels that sit underneath

1273
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,610
so when I want to attack a system for

1274
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,680
example looking at the USB stack is a

1275
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,210
great example of where to go because it

1276
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,000
has lots of power it comes on first and

1277
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,530
again it's written by somebody who

1278
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:43,940
probably wasn't thinking about security

1279
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,500
too much whereas if you go do something

1280
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,900
in Hardware the software running that

1281
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,730
USB stack and your legacy device is not

1282
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,980
a going to be able to build little

1283
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,600
mechanical arms that come up from the

1284
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,890
chip and edit some other part of the

1285
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,720
chip you can actually get some kind of

1286
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,640
security separation here and it's the

1287
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,440
one place where Moore's law helps us

1288
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,050
because you know if structural

1289
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,520
components for buildings were getting

1290
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,560
exponentially cheaper we could make our

1291
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,360
buildings very very strong at a very low

1292
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,860
cost and we actually have this benefit

1293
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,720
that the transistors that we use to

1294
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,160
construct our systems are getting

1295
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,050
exponentially cheaper so something that

1296
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,820
we might put in that costs a dollar

1297
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,520
today in 10 years may cost a penny

1298
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,530
assuming we get you know 18-month

1299
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,730
Moore's Law maybe takes a little longer

1300
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,140
than that but if you start building

1301
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,310
something now it's just slightly

1302
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,350
expensive by the time it comes to market

1303
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:28,940
it's not going to be so expensive and

1304
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,560
that's an exponential improvement that

1305
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,420
we're seeing and it means finally that

1306
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,760
we can get this separate scaling between

1307
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,100
the security-critical pieces and the

1308
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,730
overall complexity of our system so one

1309
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:42,680
of the things that my company for quite

1310
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,750
a few years has been trying to has been

1311
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,540
doing is building crypto hardware bits

1312
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,609
that do useful things for customers

1313
00:44:49,609 --> 00:44:51,320
whether it's helping to decrypt their

1314
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,780
pay-tv signals or authenticated device

1315
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,940
from anti-counterfeiting perspective but

1316
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:56,930
when you look at this from a research

1317
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,119
perspective we have candice model it's

1318
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,190
pretty straightforward it's um some sort

1319
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,960
of academic level around okay we have

1320
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,310
some kind of persistent secret we have

1321
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,410
some crypto we have some countermeasures

1322
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:08,000
to side channel attacks and glitch

1323
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,790
attacks but when you actually ask the

1324
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:11,990
question from an engineering perspective

1325
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:13,369
what does the research community

1326
00:45:13,369 --> 00:45:15,410
suggesting that we do in terms of

1327
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,690
building that crypto block what should

1328
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,480
it look like I mean it's not just an Aes

1329
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,920
doesn't really answer the question there

1330
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,350
there very well I mean should it have

1331
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:26,060
redundancy and should they have five

1332
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,980
pieces of hardware that work separately

1333
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,390
and five bits of key that go into them

1334
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:31,609
so if one fails that the system doesn't

1335
00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:33,800
fail you know can we build our side

1336
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,270
channels at the algorithm level rather

1337
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,320
than having to build them at the

1338
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,270
hardware level can we put what is an

1339
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,790
anti glitch system really look like in a

1340
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:43,580
piece of hardware like this and you know

1341
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,540
then you have to ask the question Kate

1342
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,800
what's the probability of failure

1343
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,750
against a noninvasive attack or against

1344
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,400
an invasive attack and I think we're

1345
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,260
getting to be at the point where we can

1346
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,720
have pretty good confidence that we'll

1347
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,100
survive the non invasive attacks

1348
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,350
invasive attacks trying to actually map

1349
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,119
things to probabilities gets more

1350
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,440
difficult and we don't have as good

1351
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,650
tools there again are sort of ad hoc

1352
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,869
results you know the barber is going out

1353
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:07,010
and doing stuff a little bit you know

1354
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:08,300
chips that we're actually building are

1355
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,210
doing pretty well for the most part you

1356
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,000
know we've been building cores that

1357
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,950
manage keys and seem to survive and

1358
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:17,690
we're building DP a resistant things

1359
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:19,640
that seems to do pretty well but there's

1360
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,859
a lot more work that needs to be done

1361
00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:24,580
even to build just this most simple

1362
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:28,310
construction of a key function that

1363
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,800
holds a secret now when you expand this

1364
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,869
problem just a little bit it actually

1365
00:46:32,869 --> 00:46:34,460
the answer the solutions get a lot more

1366
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,260
useful so in the previous slide I was

1367
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,640
talking about just doing something that

1368
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,050
might do challenge-response

1369
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,790
authentication or some basic operation

1370
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:42,619
like that but if we increase this to

1371
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:44,900
actually including sort of true compute

1372
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,030
we want to do run arbitrary algorithms

1373
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,890
in here in some interesting ways it

1374
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,690
point we I don't think we have really

1375
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:52,670
even a consensus as to what this should

1376
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,500
look like should it be a you know thing

1377
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,360
that can do nande operations and it kind

1378
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,860
of immolates a fully homomorphic type

1379
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,840
operation using some trusted gates

1380
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,700
should it be an FPGA like thing where I

1381
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,780
can run some kind of Diagnostics on it

1382
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,760
first to understand that it's not been

1383
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,980
Trojan dand I can force my hardware to

1384
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,310
be built before my my bit bit file so

1385
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,050
that I can kind of separate some things

1386
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,760
should it be I mean I'm pretty sure it's

1387
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,130
not an Intel you know current like a

1388
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,680
processor or even an arms ARM processor

1389
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,410
in terms of the best way to do it but I

1390
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:27,020
don't think we know yet and this is a

1391
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,760
critically important question for us to

1392
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,160
figure out what this ought to look like

1393
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,840
and what are the things that needs to do

1394
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,850
and so there are lots of interesting

1395
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,470
crypto problems here that have a really

1396
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:38,090
really big impact in the real world and

1397
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:41,090
you know the impact here ultimately

1398
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,410
needs a measured and you know what is

1399
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,660
the probability that the bitcoins being

1400
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,640
protected by that key gets stolen or

1401
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,380
what's the probability the SSL private

1402
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:51,140
key that is ultimately secured back to

1403
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,950
this piece actually gets stolen now

1404
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,300
there are others there's another thing I

1405
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,700
put cinnamon in gray here on the left so

1406
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,080
there's this shadow around manufacturing

1407
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,140
and stuff so in terms of the amount of

1408
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:06,110
engineering work the sort of live in the

1409
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,750
field use case is generally a small

1410
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,120
minority of the engineering work that

1411
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,380
goes into actually building something

1412
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,300
now you can say well okay that's the

1413
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,920
applied stuff and I'm a theoretician but

1414
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,680
no this actually needs people who

1415
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,510
understand the cryptography to be

1416
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,010
thinking about it so look when a

1417
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,420
cryptographer just rights you know there

1418
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,400
will be a key secret key known to the

1419
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,230
device and it's going to be computed as

1420
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:28,970
some function of a master key you know

1421
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:30,830
pretty straightforward all of us can

1422
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:31,580
understand what that means

1423
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,110
mathematically but what does that

1424
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,880
actually mean the real world okay so now

1425
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,350
I've got a master key where am i storing

1426
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:38,360
that how does this Drive key getting the

1427
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,070
device you know most impo motors will

1428
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:41,210
think okay great I'll go send the master

1429
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,620
key of the device and so that it can go

1430
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,200
compete it's its drive key and believe

1431
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,400
me I've seen plenty of times where the

1432
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,900
master keys end up in devices because

1433
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,880
somebody logically took this and didn't

1434
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,010
build this plumbing in the correct way

1435
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,020
and so you end up with these sort of

1436
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,120
statements but when you look at what

1437
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,670
actually has to happen here you don't

1438
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:00,800
even have a single use case you need to

1439
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,710
solve because my mobile phone

1440
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,930
has got more and more use cases that are

1441
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:06,670
being piled on to it so I actually have

1442
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,859
to build a system that can work for many

1443
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:10,690
keys and many product types and many

1444
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,880
different component vendors and many

1445
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,680
different protocols and use cases and

1446
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,900
security requirements and I can't grow

1447
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,599
my factory downtime in some way that

1448
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,060
grows basically exponentially with the

1449
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,710
number of boxes because if I have to put

1450
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,990
a new box for every sort of point here

1451
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,820
my factory is never going to operate if

1452
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,070
those boxes each have 90 percent uptime

1453
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,750
where I have one system ok I can

1454
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,570
understand how that's good actually work

1455
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,830
so if I look at just sort of the things

1456
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:39,250
that my team puts work into the back end

1457
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,790
stuff actually just dominates the the

1458
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:46,450
simple infield use cases and so in like

1459
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,770
an hour crypto manager business getting

1460
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:49,390
boxes that can work in factories is

1461
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:52,300
really really hard and then the last

1462
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,980
thing here is this question we start

1463
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,150
having secured computer what is the

1464
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,060
program that we run into in this now and

1465
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,849
so if we have this beautiful foundation

1466
00:50:00,849 --> 00:50:02,830
and some structural supports you know

1467
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:03,910
what is the thing that we're going to

1468
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:04,990
build on top of that what are the

1469
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,250
programs we're going to write and

1470
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,470
there'll be new problems that arise but

1471
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,050
in many ways the perspective that I have

1472
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,700
again coming from something of the the

1473
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,560
practitioner view is this is completely

1474
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,940
irrelevant I mean dreaming about these

1475
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,890
advanced surgeries when we don't have

1476
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,170
basic sanitation I mean it's nice but

1477
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:23,050
that's not really a problem that's

1478
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:25,180
that's relevant yet we have to go and

1479
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,710
figure out how to get some secure

1480
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:30,880
compute before we can devise enormously

1481
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,470
complicated calculations that run on it

1482
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:33,910
now there certainly is some coevolution

1483
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:37,030
that may occur there for example if we

1484
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,880
can adjust the compute to accommodate

1485
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,310
the programs that we need but the basic

1486
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,950
question how do we run operations in the

1487
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,869
real world in a way that's as strong as

1488
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:49,330
the crypto that we have is the critical

1489
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,570
issue that I think that we face

1490
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:53,800
so in conclusion here if I step back and

1491
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,470
kind of look at what's happened to kind

1492
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,060
of the world of cryptography over the

1493
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,040
time that I've had the honor to be

1494
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,660
involved with it you started out as just

1495
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,720
fairly clean circle involving keys and

1496
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,420
algorithms and I and many others have

1497
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,619
done things that kind of sort of

1498
00:51:08,619 --> 00:51:10,690
blurring the edges of that you know I

1499
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,310
remember after giving the timing attack

1500
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:14,080
paper somebody why is this a crypto

1501
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,550
engineering paper rather than a

1502
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:16,570
cryptography paper

1503
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:19,150
I thought about that and I'm not sure I

1504
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,560
even know what is cryptography and what

1505
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,450
it's engineering in fact you kind of get

1506
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:24,190
this sort of old view of what

1507
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,690
cryptography was and you get a sort of

1508
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,150
new notion of what cryptography is and

1509
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:31,750
it's this very large set of different

1510
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,850
components and things that go into

1511
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:36,940
solving problems for somebody in the

1512
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,350
same way that if you think about what is

1513
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:41,080
medicine and what does it take to get a

1514
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,850
patient who comes in with an ailment and

1515
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,130
comes out healthy or what does it take

1516
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,440
to do structural engineering or aviation

1517
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,380
you know aviation isn't just one little

1518
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,240
thing it's many different things that

1519
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,570
all blur together and we are realizing

1520
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,610
very quickly that we're in a really

1521
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:00,220
wonderfully diverse set of different

1522
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,260
problems that all connect together into

1523
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,030
in terms of solving a problem for

1524
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,800
somebody at the end of the day and when

1525
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,970
you sort of swirl all these things

1526
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,410
together you get this really sort of

1527
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:11,860
sort of psychedelic massive stuff but in

1528
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,870
terms of solving these issues I believe

1529
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:15,820
that the cryptography community is much

1530
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,320
more likely to succeed at solving these

1531
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,570
problems that other areas are likely to

1532
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,790
go and figure out cryptography and then

1533
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:24,670
successfully apply it so of the groups

1534
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:26,260
in the world that can solve these issues

1535
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:29,560
it's the people in this room and we're

1536
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,910
not going to have somebody coming and

1537
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:33,190
saving us from the outside we have to go

1538
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,080
out and figure out how to solve some of

1539
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,810
these really really hard problems and

1540
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:39,790
part of that requires going out and

1541
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:42,250
thinking across disciplines and you know

1542
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,860
the having studied biology and I'm

1543
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,940
looking at cryptography

1544
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,560
you know you get somewhat different

1545
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,750
perspective and if I could get a single

1546
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,100
thing that I think would have an impact

1547
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,110
here if I could get everybody in this

1548
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,280
room to try to go out and just have

1549
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,260
lunch with somebody in a different field

1550
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:59,950
and talk about the problems that you see

1551
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:02,650
in cryptography and what their field

1552
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:05,890
does to solve something that's the most

1553
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:07,300
connected or related that you know how

1554
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,460
does a structural engineer think about a

1555
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,910
problem like contractors cutting making

1556
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:14,920
short corn you know cutting corners you

1557
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,760
go have a lunch ask these questions and

1558
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,870
think about how some of these problems

1559
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:23,200
map back to the again the real world of

1560
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,120
what cryptography is and what it needs

1561
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:29,230
to be and the out sort of in conclusions

1562
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,130
that the result of the

1563
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:32,140
problems really matters so if you look

1564
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,660
at what happens a system scale you put

1565
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,160
the most valuable things in first so

1566
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,529
making my phone go from two processor

1567
00:53:38,529 --> 00:53:40,630
cores to sixteen possible press their

1568
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:41,799
cores makes it a little bit more useful

1569
00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:43,930
it's not eight times more valuable

1570
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:45,640
because you put the most useful stuff in

1571
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,190
first but the risks of these systems is

1572
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:50,920
growing with complexity which means that

1573
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,380
the net value that we derived from

1574
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,630
technology at some point starts to

1575
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,630
decrease you know if this 1995 Mercedes

1576
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:00,970
had windows 95 built into it and was

1577
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:02,920
connected online it would be a less

1578
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,009
valuable car than that car is as an

1579
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,890
offline car and that's really important

1580
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:11,769
in terms of asking the question of if I

1581
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:14,380
take the car and the operating system

1582
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,940
and I put them together am i making

1583
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,950
something more valuable and if we can't

1584
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,539
make it more value valuable it means

1585
00:54:19,539 --> 00:54:21,279
that society does not get the benefits

1586
00:54:21,279 --> 00:54:23,619
of the things that are possible and so

1587
00:54:23,619 --> 00:54:25,720
we have to figure out ways to make it so

1588
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,069
that least these these systems get

1589
00:54:27,069 --> 00:54:28,589
better now from a macro perspective

1590
00:54:28,589 --> 00:54:31,569
there's no magic technology is going to

1591
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:33,940
make the security situation at a global

1592
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,609
sort of overall perspective better in

1593
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:37,930
the next three to five years things are

1594
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,579
just going to get worse they have been

1595
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:41,470
getting worse it's hard to imagine how

1596
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:42,940
they will get worse and you can't say

1597
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,799
exactly what the specifics in that

1598
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,440
fractal will be but there will be an

1599
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,819
overall worsening and there will be

1600
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:51,069
individual systems that do fine and do

1601
00:54:51,069 --> 00:54:53,589
better and as a company I'm trying to be

1602
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:56,289
deliver my clients that individual

1603
00:54:56,289 --> 00:54:58,210
success that is better than the average

1604
00:54:58,210 --> 00:54:59,980
but from a macro perspective you know

1605
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,539
it's going to be a while until we can

1606
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:02,849
start even

1607
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:05,140
leveling out the curve about where

1608
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,539
things are but the technology industry's

1609
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:09,700
future depends on finding solutions to

1610
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:12,700
these and in terms of doing that we

1611
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,289
cryptography is a place we have to look

1612
00:55:14,289 --> 00:55:16,839
to them is a very broad very weird very

1613
00:55:16,839 --> 00:55:18,640
wonderful set of problems that we have

1614
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,559
and a really fantastic community that's

1615
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,319
been really just wonderful for me so we

1616
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:24,940
we have to all kind of work on this

1617
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,230
think about what it is and there's a

1618
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:28,269
huge amount of really great research

1619
00:55:28,269 --> 00:55:30,039
results that lie ahead that will be

1620
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:33,250
connected toward these problems so thank

1621
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,470
you very much for listening to me as

1622
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,930
they failed veterinarian I hope all of

1623
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:40,660
you will you know grab me in the

1624
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:41,829
sessions after it I'd love to talk with

1625
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:43,750
you more about this and

1626
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,910
depending on how much time we have I'm

1627
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:48,550
happy to take some questions thank you

1628
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,850
very much
