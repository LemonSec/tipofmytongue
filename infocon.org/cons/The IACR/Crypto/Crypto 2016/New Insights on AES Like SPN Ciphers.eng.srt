1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,360
sex for thanks for introducing my

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,420
talking is about some new insight on the

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,129
aes like lesbians divers so first there

4
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,440
were some instruction and they give some

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,810
preliminaries and then i'll give some

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,010
with your low correlation linear

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,040
cryptanalysis are we a year's like

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,940
lesbians divers and then i'll give some

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,970
applications of the application to hash

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,000
function and to the aes and finally i

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,190
give accommodation block ciphers are

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,230
among the most important primitives in

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,510
constructing critical schemes such as

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,800
authentication schemes and hash

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,090
functions and among the most ephemeris

16
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,390
block ciphers they advanced encryption

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,110
standard is currently the most

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,680
interesting candidate to build different

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,569
schemes such as these cyber these

20
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,600
schemes in the ongoing series of

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,539
competitions some of them use a es run

22
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:19,909
function directly and the others may be

23
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:27,079
used some a aes like SP divers although

24
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:29,600
the Secretary of these schemes does not

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,599
completely depend on the underlying

26
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,349
primitives we believe that the Secretary

27
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:39,799
of Labor on the reduced AES could give

28
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,069
some new insight to booth design

29
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:45,189
analysis of the authentication

30
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:50,479
encryption algorithms basically there

31
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,389
are two settings in catalysis 10 which

32
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:55,969
is the distinguish attack and the other

33
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:59,529
is the key recovery attack and for

34
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:04,159
distinguish attacks the distinguished

35
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,549
properties refers to those properties of

36
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,160
a cipher that already

37
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,970
do not have an for kira kira cover

38
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,150
attack the aim of these studies to

39
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,610
recover some raunchy so a cyber usually

40
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,230
the attack is supplied was some

41
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,990
distinguishes distinction property of

42
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,330
oil reaches run Proctor has been found

43
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,590
for example in differential

44
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,980
cryptanalysis we first to find some

45
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,270
different characteristics with high

46
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,960
probability but for a random permutation

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,270
random permutation is this character

48
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,350
characteristics may not exist and let's

49
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:53,130
see some detail of the ESPN like Cyprus

50
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,860
years I gasping divers in the design of

51
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,310
these divers who I usually use them MDS

52
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,510
matrix elements are restricted to low

53
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,520
hemingway in order to reduce the

54
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,350
workload of the multiplication

55
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,010
hooverphonic field and not only the MDS

56
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,070
matrix are always circulant but also

57
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,260
they are identical elements each group

58
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,180
for example uni yes the first rule of

59
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:33,610
the materials MDS math movies 2011 and I

60
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,910
give a little summary of the knowing

61
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,730
distinguish for the ideas or do they

62
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,820
exist some five-run distinguished for a

63
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:49,150
for a year's 192 and aes 256 the lone

64
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,550
distinguisher for origin of the area's

65
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,180
only covers at most four round for

66
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,100
example the impulse but eventually is

67
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,430
only Harbor foreign and also the indigo

68
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,640
distinguish listing shirts hold not only

69
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,970
in the choosing allen TX mood but also

70
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,890
in a Chunin servant searching see this

71
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,959
is basically because the most older

72
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,700
distinguished are based on the

73
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,730
acted at the next column is MDS matrix

74
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,750
so since the universal MDS matrix is

75
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,040
also MJ's matter so this problem this

76
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:36,250
prompted her to own both directions so

77
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,450
this is the definition of Hamming weight

78
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,240
and the correlation of put information

79
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,670
and the vectorial functions so within it

80
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,710
by we were used least attention to any

81
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,870
node circulant matrix and for the AES

82
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,520
like Cyprus we all have we also know the

83
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,010
wrong family is composed of four parts

84
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,650
the first by a drunkie saturday super

85
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,960
bite if the convenient tiffany layer is

86
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,260
made is made up of shift to loosen a

87
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,870
mixed column they we say the svn server

88
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,210
user is like a server for a year / if

89
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,990
true equal to 0 1 2 3 this means the

90
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,610
first rule is we keep the first ruin the

91
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,460
second rope left rotated by one bite and

92
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,070
the mixed column is a circulant matrix

93
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:46,510
and encrypted 2006 2016 we have proved

94
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,980
that the longest time possible

95
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:54,220
temperature of the AES is for if we do

96
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,770
not exploit the data on various box so

97
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,160
if we want to construct longer

98
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,200
impossible to potential all 0 colleges

99
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,930
we should exploit the teacher of the S

100
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,380
box and also we should explore the

101
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,360
terror all the emptiest matrix so this

102
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,210
hero give example the knowing forum for

103
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,330
one impossible or zero correlation

104
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,590
linear how all the ideas since in the m3

105
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,520
the input 2 m3 has full has three

106
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,009
another element and an output has

107
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:33,099
only one so the summer this is for which

108
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:36,069
is concert ticket with the factor that

109
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:39,189
is a branch number of the mts maitre you

110
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:44,999
survive so if the input so if the

111
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:49,119
infamous grade is like this and the

112
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:53,020
output is only one so this the

113
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:59,800
correlation of this must be zero to

114
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,439
enhance the performance of a cipher the

115
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:05,999
learners usually use identical sbox

116
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:10,599
examine a yes the six the 16s boxes in

117
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:13,870
Warren are the same and that evil lair

118
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,860
whose element often have relatively low

119
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,499
Hamming weight which not necessarily but

120
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:23,469
often cause some witness assume the

121
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:28,839
following first we will recall a fact

122
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,729
that if the input mask to a linear

123
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:40,149
fashion and his a output masculine in a

124
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:43,360
 speeding if the correct he is

125
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,599
now 0 there LOL ANF issued satisfied

126
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:51,839
that be equals to the transpose of a

127
00:07:51,839 --> 00:08:04,029
minus 1 times a and the first in the

128
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:06,039
following we were always ignore the

129
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:08,019
first test if the roots in situ came be

130
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:13,479
omitted to you catalysis we assume that

131
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:16,749
a yes like Espeon cyber satisfy the

132
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:19,419
following conditions the first one is

133
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,789
there always exists two elements such

134
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:29,110
they are two identical Melinda in the

135
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,010
transpose of the universal the mix

136
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,679
column matrix and without loss of

137
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,779
generality the s-boxes to use two

138
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:40,690
positions are the same the group

139
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:47,440
a uniform your hope let's see here so

140
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,750
not only the you put Moscow the two has

141
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,270
folks are the same but also their values

142
00:08:52,270 --> 00:09:03,490
of two xboxs are identical so so if the

143
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,010
input mask to these two position are the

144
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:12,250
same and the output master should be the

145
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,370
hemorrhage of output must be three or

146
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,610
four and you must cases each issue it

147
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,270
always it is always a forward so to make

148
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:31,230
it be three here if the input mask is a

149
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,890
800 and will already have these two

150
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,280
Illuminati so this element should be

151
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,380
zero to make this how the way we need we

152
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,480
need the recognition that the

153
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,500
informatica same and also a value to to

154
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,730
a debacle are the same so in this case

155
00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:01,180
the to the infamous call this from the

156
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,270
output of the other output mask should

157
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,450
be of this form and then like are we

158
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,030
over as I have already explained before

159
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,600
this this is a 400 euro correlation in

160
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,860
your house so in this case if the input

161
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,710
chido is firmly and output are the only

162
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,920
one active respond in the output this

163
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,240
correlation Shapiro

164
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:39,110
and since we have established some

165
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,650
relationship repeating zero correlation

166
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,870
linear how and the integral test isn't

167
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,960
integral distinguish that we can extend

168
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,150
the zero correlation dinner how to

169
00:10:52,150 --> 00:11:06,410
integral 1 lead for aes like Vince I ver

170
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:17,000
F let their triumphal to the difference

171
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,160
out to super vital the letter equal to

172
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,490
the two by two outs of keys and we

173
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,100
denote a set like this then the output

174
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,800
05 around a yeast-like SP divers were

175
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,110
how the following property the sum of

176
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,280
each byte equal 0 but for a random

177
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,380
permutation it happened with it can it

178
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,400
is not always home so this came k

179
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,350
distinguisher five other areas like

180
00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:03,040
cyber from a random permutation so let

181
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,920
if the if the if to fight o'er the plain

182
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,680
text is to battle current x equals to

183
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,750
two turtle they we did not buy theater f

184
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:31,640
like this this is the sum is let me see

185
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:38,760
so the sum is is this set so that since

186
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,360
we already know if if third hi equals to

187
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,540
the two supervisor of the keys then the

188
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,130
sum is 0 and the terror can only be one

189
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,850
two three and 0 to 2 to the power n

190
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,640
minus 1 so there also exists a delta

191
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,420
such that the sum is 0 and four random

192
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,750
permutations the property is too low so

193
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,540
this we can say that this can

194
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,860
distinguish a proc cyber from relic

195
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,660
reputation and we can also give a direct

196
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,540
proof of this theorem and we refer for

197
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,310
refer to our paper for the details so

198
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,950
next we give some applications to say hi

199
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,560
schemes since Ian peroxide we cannot

200
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,090
know the value of the cape but in

201
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,190
hutchins scheme we can sometimes we can

202
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:40,140
know that that the if if if the channel

203
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,620
change in value act as a key and we can

204
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,160
know the different of the two parts so

205
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:55,110
in in the in if we consider a hot scheme

206
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,910
we cannot to cast the value of the

207
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:06,450
difference of the two subkeys so in the

208
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,820
hottest game in her scheme the this the

209
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,040
very thought we can always do this value

210
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,060
so if the law protects the different 2

211
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,620
part of the plan X equal to this value

212
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,870
then we can determine that some of the

213
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,310
output always busy

214
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,290
and since the worker has fancy is a

215
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,460
special constant 0 mph scheme so this

216
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,190
this reality can be generous to a MP

217
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,310
hodgepodge mode and in this case the

218
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,649
substrate wind does not necessarily

219
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:55,290
former suspects this is different with

220
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:00,839
Interpol attack pascaline into attacking

221
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,230
the surface ATV is always a subspace of

222
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:11,500
f 2 to n and a Foley let's see the

223
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,500
application to the AES and since the

224
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,420
universe the transpose of the universe

225
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,610
away is like this e9 DP and they are we

226
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,600
cannot find it to element sub who cannot

227
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,899
we cannot find out who equal element so

228
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:34,779
it seems that we cannot construct such

229
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:38,220
December's for the five-run eighth spot

230
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:45,010
if we we consider the decryption of the

231
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,779
yes they since the matter is 231 one can

232
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,520
find the two elements that are you call

233
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,550
so we can construct these rumors for the

234
00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:02,490
you reverse our yes so like this if the

235
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,010
this is a cipher text if the two part of

236
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,980
the site accessible taxi equal to the

237
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,550
corresponding as at least they the sum

238
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:18,610
of the plant X is always zero just

239
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,520
reckless but for random permutation it

240
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,040
happened with the proper probability 220

241
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:30,459
minus 120 so this this property can be

242
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:34,240
used to for instance when the code book

243
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,660
is provided to determine whether it is a

244
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,860
yes when pushed the peroxide

245
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:47,850
are known since the AES adopts circling

246
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,820
the MDS matrix we can get many other

247
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,180
different varieties of this property tea

248
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,300
party but in the whole set in two

249
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,470
different states so let's see the

250
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,859
collision distinguishable the AES like

251
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,359
is being structured are covered

252
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,490
extensively in this paper and with all

253
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,890
this without a buscarla to upper

254
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:17,280
division so first one is there to our

255
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,859
technical element in lieu of the

256
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:24,020
transpose a inverse of the matrix and

257
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,900
second one is there the sbox are

258
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:35,670
identical and they in hustle mode where

259
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,890
the chaining value serves as the secret

260
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,600
key in the box I / when came further

261
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,140
remove the constraints on the mattress &

262
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,770
S boxes and we apply the new result to

263
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,750
the Opera House function and construct

264
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,780
five-run integral artistic measures and

265
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,810
also we cannot your the distinguisher in

266
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,060
the children plan text move the weekend

267
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,030
constructor father on the integrated

268
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,180
unit for the AES in the children cipher

269
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,530
text mode which is the best is

270
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,780
dissimilar for the radius with respect

271
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,810
to the number of round covers so our

272
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,840
result tissues that despite a key

273
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,080
schedule the sacral merging of the run

274
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,300
reduced AES on the chosen plaintext

275
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,570
attack may be different from that only

276
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,490
children subtext attack and we we also

277
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,330
try to apply a keyword key recovery

278
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:44,630
track you the new distinguish our if we

279
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,550
ignore the economic imbalance key of the

280
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,440
doing the partial sum there

281
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,900
attack Stephen run but in this case the

282
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,470
complexion of doing a partial sum is too

283
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,430
high and some may think that it cannot

284
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,690
be can order so someone may regard each

285
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,570
other correct or someone maybe signature

286
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,900
on so we can we did not add this route

287
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,690
to the paper so that's all thank you
