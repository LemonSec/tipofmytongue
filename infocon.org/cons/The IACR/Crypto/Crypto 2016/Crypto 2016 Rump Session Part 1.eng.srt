1
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:09,500
all right so hello everyone again we're

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,599
gonna start with my report which is on

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,240
the crypto 2016 puzzles solution and

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,920
prizes to selected winners so if you

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,140
didn't get your solution in by now I'm

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,789
about to reveal the solution if you

7
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:23,450
don't want to hear it

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,830
run outside for a couple minutes but

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,460
let's go through it so this was the

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,740
piece of the text that was included in

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,230
your packet that said use the gifts in

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,820
your registration packet to determine

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,670
the real security quotation and let's

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,670
talk about what it was that you received

15
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,039
first you got a t-shirt and this is the

16
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,249
back of the t-shirt and it has a number

17
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:47,809
of quotations on it and it has some

18
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:49,309
symbols at the beginning in the end of

19
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:52,629
each quotation and if you zoom in on

20
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:55,999
that you saw a little film strip that

21
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:58,940
was supposed to clue folks that these

22
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,670
were somehow film or movie related now

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,849
why are there a bunch of security themed

24
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,159
movie quotes on the back of your t-shirt

25
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,140
well because in addition to being

26
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,550
general chair of this conference I'm

27
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,990
also president the board of directors of

28
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,700
the Seattle International Film Festival

29
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,680
which is the largest film festival in

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,570
North America and runs for 25 days in

31
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,850
Seattle from late May to mid-june and if

32
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,900
you're ever in Seattle please come to

33
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,910
the film festival so I thought that a

34
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,610
filmer themed security themed puzzle was

35
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,280
appropriate and I should before I

36
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,990
proceed further acknowledge Josh Ben

37
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,050
ello Joshua I worked on this jointly and

38
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,570
with the two of us put this together for

39
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,550
all of you to enjoy so we deliver and

40
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,390
please kind of thank job ok

41
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,070
so there's movie quotes there is this

42
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,300
thing now called the internet so you

43
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,440
don't have to actually know all these

44
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,210
movies in your head but if you go and

45
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,280
look them up or happen to know them you

46
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,080
would find that the movies that these

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,480
floats came from often had a

48
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,150
security-related theme imitation game

49
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,770
ghostbusters didn't although it was

50
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,020
about containment sneakers hackers

51
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,510
inception Spaceballs and my personal

52
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,800
favorite Blade Runner which had to make

53
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,530
it into the puzzle now the second thing

54
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,930
on the shirt was that symbol down in the

55
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,209
lower right which was the picture of the

56
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:16,550
wine bottle highlighting the little

57
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,110
round thing in the lower right of the

58
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,480
label and then you got a wine bottle

59
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,209
with a custom label on it this is back

60
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,500
door red or backdoored wine and my

61
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,630
thanks to Michael Moniz of libertine

62
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,370
hotels in Toronto who did the graphic

63
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,370
design for me as a favor of the label

64
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,230
again Josh and I gave a basic design and

65
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,540
if you look at that symbol on the label

66
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,010
it says that which is a key to

67
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,600
understanding how to unlock the puzzle

68
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,420
it's a very simple substitution cipher

69
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,190
you take the key

70
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,400
you take the first letters of the films

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,070
and remember there was a hint that the

72
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,650
is an insignificant insignificant word

73
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,180
so you didn't look for the T in the

74
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,820
imitation game but the eye and when you

75
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,660
translate that you get theater which

76
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,330
completes the security should not be

77
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,970
confused with theater also a reference

78
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,720
back into film ok so that was the puzzle

79
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,700
we got 15 correct submissions I want to

80
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,320
acknowledge everybody on here who got a

81
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,150
correct submission Owen got and turned

82
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,090
it in by 4 o'clock I particularly want

83
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,730
to highlight shahe levees children Gil

84
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,980
and Sharon Halevi who got a solution

85
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,010
these are in order of submission so they

86
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,569
were they third correct solutions

87
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:39,659
and the youngest submitters okay now of

88
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:42,480
these 15 I have pry I have randomly

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,749
selected or excels random number

90
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:48,959
generator randomly and if you randomly

91
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,670
selected three people to win prize I

92
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,200
have real prizes up here for three of

93
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,879
these people and would marshal ball

94
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,819
jeremy jean and iran tremor please come

95
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,799
up to receive prizes for correctly

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,060

glad you enjoyed it and with that that

103
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,870
concludes my report on the crypto 2016

104
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:43,419
puzzle thank you so I hope I hope the

105
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:45,040
prize winners and I enjoy their

106
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,260
backdoors to run a number generators

107
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,330
they're getting as prizes next on stage

108
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,770
is far prettiest partly get ready

109
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,870
there's too many people standing there's

110
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,300
an additional room in the multimedia

111
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,990
pavilion and if you don't if you don't

112
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,690
sit down then the Rome session will be

113
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,580
stopped by the fire marshals we really

114
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,020
don't want that to happen so please take

115
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,850
a seat or go to the overflow theater

116
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,960
thank you much okay so good evening its

117
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,430
traditional to start Rome session with a

118
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,100
report from the program chairs behind

119
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,540
the scenes on the submission and review

120
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,669
process

121
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,050
it's my pleasure to provide that for

122
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,440
crypto 2016 we received a new record so

123
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,610
in the spirit of the Olympic ramp

124
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,000
session we have a new record to report

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,330
282 submissions reduced to 275 after

126
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,780
withdraws we accepted 70 for the program

127
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,750
which represents roughly a 25%

128
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,880
acceptance rate and here we see the

129
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,130
historical acceptance rate over the last

130
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,680
24 years so we're back to the levels we

131
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,620
were seeing before the year 2000 crypto

132
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,970
now is getting up to around about a

133
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,030
thousand reviews and given that a paper

134
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,280
length can be up to 30 pages that's an

135
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,530
enormous amount of reviewing so we had a

136
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,870
very dedicated and hardworking program

137
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,390
committee that went through all of this

138
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,060
work so thank you to all of them we also

139
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,550
had 320 external reviewers involved so

140
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,050
many of you will be in this room thank

141
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,440
you very much for your contribution

142
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,940
again in the Olympic spirit we can call

143
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,490
out some nation contributions so there

144
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,080
were six countries that provided at

145
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,840
least 5% of the submissions France US

146
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,160
Israel China Japan and Germany and this

147
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,320
translated for us of 65 percent of the

148
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,000
submissions from these countries alone

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,340
translating into seventy one seventy one

150
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,430
percent of the final accepted

151
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,580
submissions in your program

152
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,630
of course there's different ways to

153
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,450
measure cryptographic productivity and

154
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,940
the gold medal for the best use of

155
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,070
available land mass goes to Singapore

156
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,700
with one paper for every 350 kilometres

157
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,280
square so the rump session marks the

158
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,320
halfway point of crypto 2016 so you're

159
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,090
probably already thinking about next

160
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,830
year and maybe making some submissions

161
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,530
so it's worth doing little data mining

162
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,210
to see what we might learn from this

163
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,990
year so the number of co-authors I've

164
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,210
presented here the acceptance rate for

165
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,700
papers with single offer papers here you

166
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,050
see it's very hard to get a single offer

167
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,970
paper accepted so congratulations to

168
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,280
those that achieve that and as we eye to

169
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,110
offers things get progressively better

170
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,420
you get a higher acceptance rate until

171
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,000
basically after four it drops off

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,920
probably a little bit too much partying

173
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,140
takes place so it seems a four is a good

174
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,130
number for the number of co-authors you

175
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,300
also want to think about your first

176
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,130
impressions the title because remember

177
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,360
the reviewers are going to make a bid

178
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,820
for your paper to review your paper so

179
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,110
it's probably interesting to look at how

180
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,700
you structure your title to the paper

181
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,580
and short and pithy certainly wins the

182
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,290
day so titles that could be

183
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,540
characterized as short and pithy had an

184
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,080
above-average acceptance rate of 30% now

185
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,790
what's interesting is that you don't

186
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,200
want to get caught in this kind of

187
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,620
no-man's land of middle length titles it

188
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,810
turns out if you just keep piling in the

189
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,030
words you can actually move on to

190
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,980
something that's not short or not at all

191
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,650
pithy and you'll find you have pretty

192
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,690
much the same acceptance rate at the end

193
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,060
of the day so it's short or long one of

194
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,670
the other what about some of the words

195
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,100
for there any interesting keywords so

196
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,070
the committee light

197
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,410
the following words in the title so a

198
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,080
green thumbs up means you go there means

199
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,970
papers or submissions with these words

200
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,370
in the title had an above average chance

201
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,830
of being accepted so practical efficient

202
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,100
and cryptanalysis the money word for

203
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,190
crypto 2016 there was applications I had

204
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,470
a very high acceptance rate so that's

205
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,240
kind of interesting for next year

206
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,270
perhaps on the other side which were the

207
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,980
words that didn't quite capture the

208
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,600
program committee's imagination well

209
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,720
somewhat controversially for a crypto

210
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,760
conference I think encryption will do

211
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,570
well and really quite disturbingly new

212
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,650
didn't do quite so well either so so

213
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,600
anyway so hi hindsight's a wonderful

214
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,030
thing and we can you know constructs

215
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,400
what would have been an ideal title for

216
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,070
crypto 2016 oh I forgot I'm so sorry

217
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,540
let me go on some people like to

218
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,250
punctuate their title makes it a bit

219
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,630
more interesting a bit more subtle a bit

220
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,520
more considered so the committee like

221
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,920
parentheses now get a little thumbs up

222
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,750
there so above-average acceptance rate

223
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,300
the committee went bananas over colons

224
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,840
colons were very popular but the

225
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,450
question mark may be it implies a little

226
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,980
indecision or something for some reason

227
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,750
that didn't quite capture the

228
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,760
imagination that program committee so

229
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,200
bringing all this together we can come

230
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,720
up with what would it be in the ideal

231
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,060
crypto of 2016 title as I say with

232
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,040
hindsight and this would have been a

233
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,280
good title efficient cryptanalysis : no

234
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,350
practical in parentheses applications

235
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,420
are secure and it would of course have

236
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,520
been by for for authors so I'm the one

237
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,740
talking but crypto relies on the

238
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,300
contributions of many so a big thank you

239
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,570
to John and Brian my program co-chairs

240
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,980
and Brian the general chair pleasure to

241
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,930
work with you the excellent hard-working

242
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,550
program committee all the soup reviewers

243
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,320
and most importantly everyone who

244
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,110
submitted to crypto 2016 and I hope you

245
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,950
enjoy the ROM session

246
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,459
okay so next up we have something about

247
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,550
Fung Shui by somebody called Barney and

248
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,379
Nigel smart come to the stage please and

249
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:44,670
can somebody bring me a beer that would

250
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,149
be really appreciated

251
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,240
so unsurprisingly his favorite

252
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,129
discipline is never throwing well this

253
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:00,990
is a plug for a UNIX paper but clearly

254
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,170
this title would never made it to crypto

255
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,689
so there is in fact way too many authors

256
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:08,819
and that the team into it actually was

257
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:11,490
indeed hammer throw because I was

258
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,410
thinking of field hockey today actually

259
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,139
the devlins meat was written by Belgium

260
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,119
in field hockey so I guess my time would

261
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:19,769
have rejected my paper if I did so I

262
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:22,110
didn't take any risks there so it's a

263
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,730
very confusing title where many authors

264
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,040
will each choice of words and then we

265
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,449
put it together and somehow it goes into

266
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:33,829
use next so what we do we really do okay

267
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:36,829
this

268
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:43,450
we broke RSA in the cloud so how does it

269
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:43,720
work

270
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,470
use some very simple ideas and some

271
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,420
simple crypto machinery but very clever

272
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,000
software stuff don't mind court we have

273
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,640
the University of Amsterdam so we used

274
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,040
actually two basic building blocks one

275
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,330
is row hammer and I hope you all know

276
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,970
that Kenny is Scottish so I knew you

277
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,260
actually would accept this paper with

278
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,330
those beautiful pictures of Scottish

279
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,250
people so

280
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,830
rahama is a very cool trick in which you

281
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,470
can actually flip bits in the RAM as a

282
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,940
consequence of higher densities in the

283
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,790
RAM by reading repeatedly at jaikant

284
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,590
drops so you never have to write in the

285
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,570
memory you just read aloud then some

286
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,520
moment you flip bits in the middle row

287
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,770
so now you already understand why there

288
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,750
is flip in the title and why there is

289
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,430
hammering the title and why I chose the

290
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,790
hammer through okay so it's a bit tricky

291
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,440
to find out actually if you're in the

292
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,280
clout which bits flip and practical guys

293
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,570
from our team they spend about ten

294
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,580
minutes of effort to find one bit flip

295
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,200
that works so this is why we don't use

296
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,700
hundred and have a sub bit flips and you

297
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,000
can't completely control the location

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,940
next thing is memory the duplication so

299
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,040
what happens in the cloud you actually

300
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,080
can rent your machines with the cloud

301
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,510
providers and actually they try to be

302
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,180
efficient and using this and attack I

303
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,040
can actually map the physical memory

304
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,130
page of the victim virtual machine you

305
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,630
attack a project address space the

306
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,940
scenario is that somebody has a cloud

307
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,860
instance which you want to attack so you

308
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,840
actually also make a cloud instance and

309
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,890
then from your cart it's you're going to

310
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,380
attack the keys of the other copy and

311
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,350
how do you do it based on duplication

312
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,600
and the function we part is because we

313
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,130
have to neatly arranged memory in a

314
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,740
harmonic way to actually get to do it

315
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,510
and this is a crazy thing to be part of

316
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,750
the part so how does it work is very

317
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,130
simple you have this blue virtual

318
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,100
machine you have the victim so you host

319
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,900
have the victim having this machine the

320
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,760
attacker having this machine and so if

321
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,620
each has their own physical memory at

322
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,650
about and so what you do is in attacker

323
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,630
is you put content in your virtual

324
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,550
machine which likely the attacker will

325
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,260
also have can be a list of keys that's

326
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,420
public public keys of course or maybe

327
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,950
some other things in this case the pick

328
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,450
and so what will happen in the cloud is

329
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,980
actually that the plug will want to be

330
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,570
efficient what they will do is they will

331
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,040
actually spot the duplication

332
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,440
it will save memory and put it together

333
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,589
with pointers the next thing is if you

334
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:03,820
again start flipping bits in your

335
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,270
virtual machine using pro hammer what

336
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,440
will happen in the physical memory it

337
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,970
will be updated and you actually now

338
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,279
flip the memory out of the victim

339
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,080
without doing anything you don't have to

340
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,490
violate any of the access control rules

341
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,649
of the cloud you actually go to the

342
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,870
software stack with your needle and you

343
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,680
flip the bits so what can you do in

344
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,740
practice somebody is running OpenSSH in

345
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,080
this cloud instance you start Asus a

346
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,670
session with the wrong key doesn't

347
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,860
matter what the victim will do is read

348
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,830
Auto ASCII file with an RSA modulus you

349
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,050
now do your o hammer mid flip and you

350
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,790
look a bit of the modulus so it's no

351
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,680
longer an RSA modulus is now a random

352
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,470
integer of 4,000 bits that turns out to

353
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,850
be easy to factor so the method we use

354
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,560
for elliptic curve if the core

355
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,360
factorization depends on the second

356
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,279
largest prime factor and there is good

357
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,230
statistics about this we know that on

358
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,930
average it's about 20% of the size of

359
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,950
the modulus so and if you're lucky of

360
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,800
course it's even much smaller that's it

361
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,170
more or less we used stammered tool this

362
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,190
wrong sport I guess but ok so that

363
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,690
before with module II you can see we can

364
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,490
factor almost all of them with 10 bit

365
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,800
flips what we used was about one hour

366
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,170
time on a big cluster for gigabyte RAM

367
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,790
then we stopped if we abandoned if they

368
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,339
couldn't make that got 48 bit we can do

369
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:26,920
more or less but we still get very close

370
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,930
to all of them with 30 bit flips and

371
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,930
then 50 bit flips we got up to 80% of

372
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,870
all 4096 bit modulation and of course

373
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,490
was tried on real part instances really

374
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,260
in the cloud we made this work in

375
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,480
practice of course we did warn the cloud

376
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,880
providers in advance that they should

377
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,649
implement countermeasures against this

378
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:47,230
attack similar thing are GPG you can

379
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,959
actually use the update mechanism in DB

380
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:52,510
down the window the apt you first modify

381
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,790
the sources.list so in fact malware will

382
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,650
be downloaded rather than from the real

383
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,810
at the moment of the signature checking

384
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,660
you actually flip the RSA keys the

385
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,360
trusted GPG file you factor again until

386
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,250
your forged signature and now install

387
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,850
malware in the victims machine again you

388
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,520
factorize it that's it so we also

389
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,960
extension to development the problem

390
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,220
there is that your publicly available

391
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,140
software for this we log is not as good

392
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,880
as the others factoring so we didn't get

393
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,120
as far with diffie-hellman as for RSA

394
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,590
but the paper has the technical details

395
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,690
we also discuss mitigations and if you

396
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,100
want to find the paper it's on there

397
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,090
thank you very much for your attention

398
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,180
thanks bar with Jeremiah please come to

399
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,920
the stage and next up we have Nigel

400
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,730
smart

401
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,680
there's loads of seats down here for

402
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,090
those standing oh yeah thanks idle

403
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,980
please come and sit down otherwise we'll

404
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,850
get shut down

405
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,130
yeah please you're standing please come

406
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,690
sit here be uh provides the rub session

407
00:16:49,690 --> 00:17:07,930
will be shut right ok in there if you

408
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:17,470
can meet and we will have Jeremiah and

409
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,240
we will do something to fix Nigel's talk

410
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,359
at some point thanks for your

411
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,679
understanding Nigel great talk

412
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,590
okay all right thanks everyone

413
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,260
like to give you a quick update on the

414
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,510
 Olympic Games which as you know are

415
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,270
taking place right now and I want to

416
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,220
talk about my favourite event which is

417
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:48,179
password frequency list disclosure so

418
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:52,929
there we go so some of you may be

419
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:56,049
unfamiliar with this exciting event so

420
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:57,250
how does it work

421
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,289
contestants start by collecting a large

422
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:02,860
data set of user passwords and then they

423
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,529
produce a histogram which is just a plot

424
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:07,510
of the frequency of the most popular

425
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,880
passwords and finally the goal is to

426
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,460
release a frequency list which can be

427
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,649
obtained by simply removing the

428
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:16,720
passwords and just outputting The

429
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,600
Associated frequencies and contestants

430
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,380
may perturb these lists to protect user

431
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,940
privacy so how our contestants judged in

432
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,610
these Olympic Games well there's three

433
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,330
criteria the first scoring criteria is

434
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,840
data set size so the more users the

435
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,020
better the second criteria is accuracy

436
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,020
if you can release a frequency list

437
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,640
that's more accurate that's better and

438
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,299
the final criteria is privacy if you're

439
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:52,419
not giving away user passwords that's

440
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:56,169
also better so you may think this is a

441
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,990
game that I just made up but I assure

442
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,649
you there's a long history of

443
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:04,500
organisations competing in this event

444
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,309
for example Rock you submitted an entry

445
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:12,850
several years ago with 32 million user

446
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,480
passwords unfortunately most of the

447
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,100
previous contestants have had to be

448
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,500
disqualified due to failure to properly

449
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,750
protect user passwords so today I want

450
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,149
to tell you about a new leading

451
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:34,480
candidate for gold medal Yahoo just

452
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,890
turned in a very strong performer

453
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,290
they collected a dataset of 70 million

454
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:44,350
user passwords and they used tools from

455
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,730
differential privacy to actually perturb

456
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,650
these password frequency lists before

457
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,260
they were released so I should stress

458
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,600
that the status at civ ailable and it

459
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,949
was released with permission

460
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:01,040
so let's score this entry first criteria

461
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,020
accuracy well we can actually compare

462
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,760
basic statistics like minimum entropy

463
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,120
guessing entropy that you'd get with the

464
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,880
sanitized data set with the same

465
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,770
statistics computed on the original data

466
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,270
set and we actually see that the

467
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,110
statistics match in almost every case

468
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,790
with occasionally we'll get small

469
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:28,460
variation and what about privacy

470
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,650
well they also had strong scores on the

471
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,930
privacy criteria in particular they

472
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,670
preserved differential privacy with the

473
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,950
value composite value of epsilon equals

474
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,970
0.5 of course a single user might

475
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,150
consult apin tatah sets so you have to

476
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,870
scale epsilon appropriately so what does

477
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,300
this mean well this means we can promise

478
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,330
Alice that you know if we had removed

479
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,060
her password from the data set at the

480
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,610
onset before we ran the differentially

481
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,580
private mechanism the probability of any

482
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,790
subset of outcomes doesn't change too

483
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,420
much when we exclude her or password so

484
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,710
this means that the probability that

485
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,440
alice gets hacked doesn't change too

486
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,870
much you know based on whether her

487
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,550
password was included or not

488
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,060
okay so password frequency lists have

489
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,760
many applications the simplest one is

490
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,820
just estimate the total number of users

491
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,100
that could be compromised in an online

492
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,200
attack where the adversary has beta

493
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,380
guesses per user there's lots of other

494
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,570
exciting applications I hope you'll all

495
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,640
search for the data set if you just

496
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,320
search for a yahoo password frequency

497
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,260
corpus you'll find it please play around

498
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,320
with it

499
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,590
I hope that it's useful for you and for

500
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,290
many of you and your research endeavors

501
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:58,040
and finally I'd like to conclude by

502
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,660
saying that I hope other organizations

503
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,480
will challenge Yahoo for gold there are

504
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,730
other organizations that potentially

505
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,060
could collect larger password frequency

506
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,480
lists and follow the same pattern and

507
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,080
perhaps steal that gold medal from Yahoo

508
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:25,830
so thank you okay so Nigel is now you're

509
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,240
going to try again with his second

510
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,910
presentation but Kerri if you're in the

511
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,380
room please get close to the stage

512
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,640
because you might be on sooner than

513
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,270
expected

514
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,160
okay and please take a seat if you're

515
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,810
standing in the back corner I can see

516
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,370

517
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,920
I call you on your behavior please take

518

a seat

519
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,560
all right or leave auditorium otherwise

520
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,340
we'll get shut down Nigel okay to work

521
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,900
okay I don't know there's something

522
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,310
wrong with the computer we're gonna fix

523
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,140
you'll see the other talk later I've

524
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,150
been promised okay so this is about a

525
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,480
speed King you're gonna hear me sing so

526
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,710
if anyone gets the reference they're

527
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,730
just far too old really okay okay

528
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:08,370
except oh okay I'm not actually going to

529
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,060
sing right but if thank you thank you

530
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,340
for the that's exactly what I want yeah

531
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,530
thank you I'm not gonna sing but if

532
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,630
you're interested in NPC this is the

533
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,240
rump session talk for you so we've got

534
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,110
so three or four things to announce

535
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,630
speed is now open source and I'm going

536
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,980
to give you the link to that it will be

537
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,010
made open source it's not actually other

538
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,780
source yet but it will be by the end of

539
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,000
the week there's still some tidying up

540
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,070
they've got to do okay but everything's

541
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,320
ready to go we're going to give you some

542
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,750
timings we've achieved there's going to

543
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,850
be a new conference on MPC and there's

544
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,050
going to be some jobs because basically

545
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,520
every bloody run per session I have to

546
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,990
get up and tell you there's some jobs do

547
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,780
you know where the jobs are which

548
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,600
University Bristol yeah that's it

549
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,100
they're kind of right there we go okay

550
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,000
yeah right okay so it's now open source

551
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,620
hopefully now well it could be in the

552
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,120
next couple of days

553
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,180
the documentation is as we it's a little

554
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,240
shaky if you want to sign up for

555
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,700
announcements and to find out all about

556
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,040
it there's a Google group called speeds

557
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,890
at Google Groups comm and you can visit

558
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,540
the web page which is really long just

559
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,250
like Bristol speeds and you'll get it

560
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,290
into Google other search engines are

561
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:26,100
available for Brian you can use paying

562
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,380
if you want but Google will do it for

563
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,780
you so that's some that's when you can

564
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,150
see me fly if you're going to have a

565
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,770
party then you need large numbers of

566
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,860
people to come to that party so we

567
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,440
decided we wanted a very large party so

568
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,620
we actually ran well Marcel did he ran a

569
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,470
hundred party auction so this is this is

570
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,000
not sugar beets because they only had

571
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,190
three parties in their auction and it

572
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,900
was only semi honest when they did it

573
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,310
this is a proper auction with a hundred

574
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,340
people fully malicious and we actually

575
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,990
ran so this so when people talk about

576
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,870
multi-party computation the record now

577
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,760
is running a computation on a hundred

578
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,770
parties we hope to be able to push it to

579
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,560
a thousand parties at some point in the

580
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,710
next few months so I'm the goal is now

581
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,150
let's make things faster but to have

582
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,780
more people at your party and we can now

583
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,530
do twenty two thousand twenty two two

584
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,930
hundred twenty thousand sorry blocks per

585
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,820
second of a s this is not as good as

586
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,250
your Hooters record which is going to be

587
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,350
presented at CCS where he can do a

588
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,930
million blocks of a s per second that

589
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,910
he's integrated to into a Kerberos

590
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,880
system but this is a system that will

591
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,740
work for many parties whereas your who

592
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,340
does things for three there we go so

593
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,600
we've got some new kind of cool stuff

594
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,360
coming up there and there's a new

595
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,480
workshop it's it's going to be if you go

596
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,180
to the website

597
00:25:50,180 --> 00:26:14,280
www.marykay.co.uk/awilliam seventh in

598
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,260
Bristol it kind of continued

599
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,930
from the the event that you should be

600
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,730
held every two years in our house but

601
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,960
now we're going to hold it every year

602
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,850
we're going to move around Europe

603
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,750
probably oh I should say that all of my

604
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,370
slides have a sort of growing epitaph

605
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,010
you see to them because we're Great

606
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:41,010
Britain well we are currently and and we

607
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,230
only excel at Olympic sports where we

608
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,660
can apply our Formula One technology so

609
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,130
we're good at cycling which you'd have

610
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,480
seen in the real world trips I talked

611
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,340
but we're also good at rowing as well

612
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,020
because we could just apply technology -

613
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,370
it doesn't have to be any good at

614
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,950
athletics so that's why we've got the

615
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,990
rowing metaphor in all my slides you see

616
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,760
because we're very good at that and of

617
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,840
course ramming is quite good for

618
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,460
multi-party computation because you need

619
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,190
many people to do a good rowing team you

620
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,050
know I think it's amazing in every year

621
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,460
we have this oxygen Cambridge Boat Race

622
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,320
I'm not quite sure how both of them get

623
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,760
always get into the final but there we

624
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,600
go but there's eight in each team and so

625
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,370
we so when you need a team of people to

626
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,920
do rowing you need extra people on your

627
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,080
team and so what I want to say my last

628
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,760
um slide is I just got paid shed loads

629
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,730
of cash right and so with this shed

630
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,340
loads of cash I want to make a bit a

631
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,680
better bigger rowing team so if you want

632
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,170
to join our rowing team come and help us

633
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,330
spend the money talk to some of the

634
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,740
postdocs who are here they will tell you

635
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,040
travel is no objective and come and work

636
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,130
for us five years apply online now just

637
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:54,890
come and do it thank you thank you

638
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,120
so if you if you'd like to be a galley

639
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:08,410
slave in Bristol for five years we we

640
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,330
also have postdocs at Rowe Holloway

641
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,810
please come talk to me and I'd like now

642
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,030
to introduce Kerry McKay or McKay

643
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,920
good Scottish name they're from this

644
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,390
Thank You Kerry next up Marcel hi I'm

645
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,040
Terry McKay from this you may have never

646
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,660
seen me before because I generally don't

647
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,760
like to give these talks but here I am

648
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,160
so I want to talk to you tonight a

649
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,720
little bit about lightweight

650
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,340
cryptography and our standardization

651
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,190
plans so you may have heard of us and we

652
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,780
have these standards like AES

653
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,780
shot-to-shot three but the what we're

654
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,300
hearing from people is that AES is just

655
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,550
too damned hall for the uneven bars we

656
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,290
need something a little bit lighter so

657
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,260
nits initiated a lightweight crypto

658
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,390
project to understand kind of where our

659
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,700
standards fall short so some of you made

660
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,860
might have come to our first lightweight

661
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,800
crypto workshop in July of last year at

662
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,240
NIST and we're going to hold the second

663
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,190
one this October and what we're looking

664
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,230
for is lightweight algorithms for

665
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,640
constrained environments and of course

666
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,610
use cases so how are we going to do this

667
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,050
is the big question it's something we've

668
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,990
been struggling with we did just last

669
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,740
week put out our draft report this IRA

670
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,350
eight one one four and it's posted for

671
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,510
public comment so you know after you've

672
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,740
had a few drinks go and look at it

673
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,720
tonight it gives an overview of the

674
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,280
project includes our plan for

675
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,980
Standardization which boils down to two

676
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,810
essential things we're going to

677
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,740
recommend primitives based on the

678
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,500
application and device profiles and

679
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,240
we're gonna create a portfolio of the

680
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,440
lightweight primitives through an open

681
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,380
process similar to our 838 series for

682
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,810
the modes of operation and the reason

683
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,040
we're doing this is because if we try

684
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,870
and do a competition for this by the

685
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,520
time we finished with the

686
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,960
standardization no one's gonna be using

687
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,930
that technology anymore so the profiles

688
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,150
are really the key to what we have so

689
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,039
or the key to our plan so we're gonna

690
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,350
hit describe we're gonna have profiles

691
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,900
that represent classes of devices and

692
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,880
applications and we're going to build

693
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,559
these profiles based on public feedback

694
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,669
so this is just a template from the

695
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:14,110
report if you want more information

696
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,870
about what actually goes in these fields

697
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,730
please look at the report but in general

698
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,010
it's we've got a primitive the physical

699
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,900
performance and security characteristics

700
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,169
and also some device design goals but

701
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:28,690
here's the thing we work at NIST and

702
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,799
we're not actually out in the field

703
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:32,080
using this stuff but you guys are so we

704
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,640
really need your help in developing

705
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,799
these profiles so we have a list of

706
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:37,690
questions in the run out draft report

707
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,730
that we need your input on we need your

708
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,860
answers otherwise we're just gonna be a

709
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,270
bunch of people just in a room making

710
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,250
stuff up we'll try our best to make up

711
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,380
something useful but you actually know

712
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,700
what you need not us so right now we've

713
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,020
got the draft report out the comments

714
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:57,070
are due by October 31st and if you are

715
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,840
going to be awesome enough to help us

716
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,659
out by answering these questions to help

717
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,549
us develop profiles it would be really

718
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:05,710
great if you get those to us by october

719
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,510
1st so that we actually have time to

720
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,520
draft some profiles to discuss at the

721
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,010
workshop which again is hell being held

722
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:15,100
in october 17 for 18 again at NIST and

723
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,110
if you want to participate in that the

724
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,270
deadline for submissions is September

725
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,149
9th so if you would like to contact us

726
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:24,130
or get more information or join our

727
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,370
mailing list we have a lightweight email

728
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,200
list like the hash forum there hasn't

729
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,520
been much activity on it yet but

730
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,779
hopefully that'll change soon as the

731
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:33,429
project just picking up we also have

732
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:34,990
information on the workshop and the

733
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,730
project in general thank you

734
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,669
excellent thank you very much I've been

735
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,960
asked to speak up but can you hear me at

736
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,889
the back okay is it good yes excellent

737
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:51,480
thank you for one thumbs up at the back

738
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,940
and Martin would like a cup of tea so if

739
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,620
somebody could go fetch Martin a cup of

740
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,419
tea that'd be great and if someone could

741
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:59,009
bring me a bottle of vodka that would be

742
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:02,610
good too okay okay and that's to prepare

743
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,830
us for Marcel Keller who's next up and

744
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,970
he's gonna be followed by you and Eamonn

745
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,440
so if you and Damon could come to the

746
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,340
stage Thank You Ann hi Owen okay Marcel

747
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,700
thank you

748
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,210
so I'm Marcel I'm one of the slaves so I

749
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:20,759
come talk to me what I'm going to talk

750
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:22,830
about today is homeopathic encryption

751
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,860
and I have to say it's a substantially

752
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,470
shameless steal by a working progress

753
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:31,679
talk from USENIX I think it was Eric

754
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,570
gusto I hope I don't miss the pretty

755
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:36,809
miss attribute this so yeah come talk to

756
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:40,350
me if that's wrong anyway homo public

757
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,690
encryption of course it's going to be

758
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,960
round based because that's how proper

759
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,149
encryption schemes work we start

760
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:50,279
unsurprisingly with a message m and a

761
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:54,600
key K and there we go first round with

762
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,570
probability 2 to the minus twelve point

763
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,330
eight we're gonna assign K to K

764
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:06,960
otherwise K is XOR K XOR K we continue

765
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,200
with round two again with probability 2

766
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,960
to the minus 12 point 8 kg o'clock way

767
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,730
otherwise k equal K XOR K and this

768
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,549
already brings us to round number three

769
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:22,649
which says that with probability 2 to

770
00:33:22,649 --> 00:33:24,750
the minus twelve point eight K is K

771
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:29,309
otherwise K is K XOR K and oh that's

772
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:31,350
already round number four with

773
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,019
probability 2 to the minus twelve point

774
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:37,950
eight K equals K otherwise we assign K

775
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:43,110
to K XOR K and now you might be

776
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:46,100
surprised that's wrong number five

777
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,920
probability - - 12.8 kegels clay

778
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,690
otherwise k equals K XOR K and that's

779
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,690
quickly moved to round number six

780
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,920
probability 2 to the minus twelve point

781
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,640
eight we assign K to K otherwise that

782
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,660
with probability 1 - 2 - 2 12 and 8 we

783
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:11,100
assign K XOR K to K and then there's my

784
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,520
lucky number round number 7 probability

785
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,550
to the minus twelve point eight K equals

786
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:25,110
K otherwise K okay XOR K yes oh yeah

787
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:28,219
that's one more than our number eight

788
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:31,380
probability so we flip very heavily

789
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,899
biased coin essentially in all those

790
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:38,940
rounds 12 - probably government probably

791
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,330
2 to the 12 minus 12 1 8 we assign K to

792
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,030
K otherwise K is gonna be okay

793
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:52,159
XOR K kkkk oh yeah that's wrong number 9

794
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,320
yeah I think we have to get go to 10 12

795
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,790
14 a yes style - two - twelve - twelve

796
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:03,510
point eight resign K - K otherwise K XOR

797
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,870
K K okay ten oh yeah that's one more

798
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:10,710
you're gonna be surprised - to the minus

799
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,420
twelve point eight K equals K otherwise

800
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,110
K equals K XOR okay and oh yeah finalize

801
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:24,860
ciphertext is gonna be C equals M XOR K

802
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,140
so that's the scheme let's talk about

803
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,160
implementation so we as you might have

804
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,740
seen that we really rely on fast random

805
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,040
number generation and of course I can

806
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,900
know their chess people here so you're

807
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,490
really concerned about you know embedded

808
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:44,280
systems Hardware maybe there is no

809
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,440
faster on them generation I can assure

810
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,240
you I don't have time for this but

811
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,610
there's a slight tweak to the algorithm

812
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,980
that makes this algorithm much more

813
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,150
efficient on

814
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,000
crickets systems and last but not least

815
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,059
also were very important the design

816
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:03,260
encourages constant time implementation

817
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,230
so you if you do if statements on either

818
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,670
the message of the key like you're

819
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,240
really doing it wrong last but not least

820
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,500
there's other special properties so we

821
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,349
hadn't thought about this and it really

822
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:21,119
are we really sure about the fact that

823
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,980
quantum attacks are really no better

824
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,609
than classical attacks on on this one so

825
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:29,250
that's like for the post quantum crab

826
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,309
lava community and on the other hand

827
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:34,710
like for the Fancy Pants community of

828
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,779
course it's also fully homomorphic and

829
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:42,089
and now here's an akut for the more as i

830
00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:46,770
say like policy oriented community we

831
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,539
think we strongly believe that this one

832
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,579
is particularly suitable for compliance

833
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:54,270
and marketing because it's encrypted to

834
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,569
after all right and this already

835
00:36:57,569 --> 00:37:01,490
concludes my talk thank you very much

836
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:12,059
thanks Marcel hilarious as ever

837
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:14,619
next up we have a talk called kangaroo

838
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:16,989
12 by you and Damon and if Brian would

839
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:18,579
like to come to the stage that would be

840
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:19,739
great you want to get away

841
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:23,140
yeah good evening so this is a more

842
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,719
serious talk I'm afraid to joint work

843
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,910
with the catch act team and honey so I

844
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:31,989
call it funny I choose a sports so it's

845
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:35,380
a kangaroo what they can go do it boxes

846
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,640
but I don't know if it's in a little bit

847
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,799
care discipline maybe it has been

848
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:41,380
haven't seen any boxing but okay yeah I

849
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,869
can google boxes and I think you will

850
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:48,449
need it so what is it is basically

851
00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:51,449
hashing based on catch acti a bit like

852
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:54,789
shot v it's like the shake functions

853
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:57,279
with them more efficient so what we did

854
00:37:57,279 --> 00:38:02,939
we did the exercise to bring ghachok

855
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:07,989
more down to where it should be - if you

856
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:10,929
look at the safety margin and we also

857
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:13,569
try to exploit parallelism so first the

858
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:18,069
the safety margin so if you look at the

859
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:19,769
state of kept analysis

860
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:23,079
up to now the best attacked the best

861
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:25,420
collision attack against gataki

862
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,670
is 5 rounds and the best publish there

863
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,650
may be some distinguishing stuff but the

864
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,799
best attack is 5 rounds but it has 24

865
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:33,219
outs

866
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:37,359
so you basically have more than 4 for a

867
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,459
factor 4 more rounds than we really need

868
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:41,589
so Enki actually already took that into

869
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:43,179
account and we reduce the number of

870
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:46,539
rounds to half to 12 so let's do also

871
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:50,079
the washing with 12 rounds so we reduce

872
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,599
from 24 hours to 12 rounds and that

873
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:55,479
still gives us a factor of 2 safety

874
00:38:55,479 --> 00:39:01,049
margin so then if we look at modern CPUs

875
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:03,699
we see more and more these same d

876
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:05,410
instructions going broader and broader

877
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,749
so we have a lot of parallelism that we

878
00:39:07,749 --> 00:39:10,089
can do and as all so many CPUs with

879
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:12,339
mouths many cores and we would like to

880
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:14,770
exploit a parallelism but in

881
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,589
it's points basically it's serial mode

882
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:20,950
so we introduce a kind of triage touch

883
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,490
and that's basically what we did so this

884
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,740
is the structure of a kangaroo 12 so

885
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,040
these blue blocks there are basically

886
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,750
the input blocks of the message so we

887
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:36,790
split our message into 8,192 byte blocks

888
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,670
and we can do them in parallel so you

889
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,869
see there those vertical bars that are

890
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:46,990
all inputs to get JAXA to catch X

891
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,270
version with 12 rounds and we can do

892
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:53,950
them in parallel and then we append the

893
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,900
chaining values to the first block is a

894
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,710
CFO and that's that's also one call so

895
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,540
each of these arrows represents a call

896
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,160
to the underlying hash function we just

897
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,710
sketch our 12 rounds and the whole thing

898
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,320
is a 3 has mods so you see also there

899
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,270
this chaining value that's some more

900
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,320
hashing you have to do but it's

901
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,410
compensated by the parallelism so if you

902
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:18,250
look at these symbols 1 1 0 and so on

903
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,040
that's in fact padding and frame bits

904
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,770
that complies to the secure mode so if

905
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:26,680
you do it this way you get a provable

906
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,050
reduction of security to the security of

907
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,420
the underlying hash function so what

908
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,540
does this give us something went wrong

909
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,180
with slide but ok yeah that was there

910
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:44,589
was a kangaroo there so on the and the

911
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:46,599
hospital and skylight for short well

912
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:49,390
short messages you which about something

913
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,869
below around for between 4 and 5 cycles

914
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:54,430
per byte but so long inputs you can

915
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:57,190
really exploit this parallelism so for

916
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,380
instance for the house well you get down

917
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:04,060
to 1.44 or scarlet 1.22 cycles per byte

918
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:08,190
so they you exploit for level four wide

919
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,589
parallelism and on this new CPU knights

920
00:41:11,589 --> 00:41:15,760
landing basically can get down to 0.74

921
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,730
cycle four bytes so there we put the

922
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,920
paper on ICEA and you can find the code

923
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,220
that has achieved this resolves in the

924
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,970
croco package that's made public by show

925
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:34,560
thank you that's it thank you so I just

926
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,780
like to emphasize that no kangaroos were

927
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,720
harmed in the making of that talk we

928
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,630
just don't like kangaroos and here comes

929
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,869
Brian okay about this Bank for something

930
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:48,930
special so for what we're calling the

931
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:52,050
charity auction or a long jump for

932
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:54,569
charity so for the purposes of this talk

933
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:57,390
I am representing the great Great

934
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,300
Britain and their team and the long jump

935
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,500
for reasons that will become apparent in

936
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,180
a moment for as long as Great Britain is

937
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,390
still exists

938
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,980
Iran thanked me for taking you down a

939
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,500
walk on cinema Lane I'm now gonna take

940
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,020
you a walk down I ACR lanes in

941
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,450
particular I want to go back 25 years to

942
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,109
Europe 1991 who-knows-where europe 1991

943
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:23,220
was held okay Kenny

944
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,960
Brighton in the United Kingdom Mike it

945
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,819
was my first ever you ripped it was your

946
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:28,170
first year cupped it was my first jerk

947
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,060
ripped as well and it was here at the

948
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,710
University of Brighton in the UK and who

949
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:34,920
was the general chair it was Andy Clark

950
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,770
that's right and what was the Urich of

951
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:41,270
1991 special beverage that everyone got

952
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,910
beer in particular something that looked

953
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,109
like this it was euro crypt 91

954
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:51,450
celebration ale and it was my memory of

955
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:54,569
this beer that Andy did that caused me

956
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:56,190
to think about doing a custom label for

957
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,329
something which is why we have a wine

958
00:42:57,329 --> 00:42:58,740
bottle here with a nice custom label

959
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,819
because I kind of grew up from the

960
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:04,050
period of the wine now I accepted to be

961
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,839
general chair two years ago and about

962
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:09,420
six months after that I was cleaning out

963
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,819
an old box in the back of my closet that

964
00:43:13,819 --> 00:43:16,410
had been there probably since graduate

965
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:17,880
school days that I had moved from a

966
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,440
bunch of places to places and I'd never

967
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,730
seen the light of day and I found this

968
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,980
little cardboard box here from Harvin

969
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,160
sons and when I opened it up I found

970
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,730
inside one unopened original bottle of

971
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:34,640
uric ripped 91 celebration ale

972
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:42,490
best before end date July 91 okay it was

973
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,400
in April so I thought what should we do

974
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,260
with this bottle since it's a special

975
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,240
occasion that it's 25 years and I

976
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,070
thought the thing we should do was to

977
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,860
have a charity auction to benefit the

978
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,510
National Museum of computing at

979
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,210
Bletchley Park now so I am about to

980
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:01,000
auction this off for charity open your

981
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,910
wallets up why National Museum of

982
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,860
