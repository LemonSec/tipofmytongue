1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,519
right so so I'm suburb leopard and this

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,089
is what Halloween this is where I'm from

3
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:15,450
and the zoo co-authors are from bar-ilan

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,690
University in a literal and he bends

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,330
fees here in the conference she's a

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,150
student of Boaz at seven and this was a

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,610
result of a project when she came to

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,500
visit or fall away last last summer so I

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,210
want to talked about cryptanalysis of

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,780
the algebraic eraser this is a scheme

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,089
was introduced a while ago now in 2002

12
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,070
by Anne Shiell and she'll go Felton

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,129
demure and it's a it's a key exchange

14
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,199
primitive a bit like diffie-hellman

15
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:51,059
similar sort of protocol flow but it's

16
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,219
based on matrix groups and permutation

17
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,929
groups and break groups so it's a group

18
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,589
based coding system so as a field group

19
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:00,089
a script ography I think in general has

20
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:02,249
a poor reputation for being a lot of at

21
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:04,229
the moment certainly the many schemes

22
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:05,190
which aren't great that have been

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,430
proposed however and transformed no felt

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,960
in particular produced some beautiful

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,180
papers early on with some lovely ideas

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,270
in so I think it's always interesting to

27
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,439
to see anything that this group comes up

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,289
with because the the ideas are worth

29
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:24,659
thinking about and then one of the

30
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,850
reasons that I first became interested

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,229
in in this area really because secure RF

32
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,960
a company US company they're the owners

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,439
of the algebraic eraser and their that's

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,909
the out there marketing it for the

35
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,060
printers of things applications so in

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,960
particular in 2015 and then from 2015

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,670
they proposed to ISO standards body a an

38
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,310
algebraic invasive based RFI team rfid

39
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,289
tag identification protocol

40
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:02,280
so if actually go to this QRF website in

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,179
fact they've replaced that by a

42
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:07,770
different protocol due to attacks on

43
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,889
this

44
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:14,360
okay so write tiles became interested in

45
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,800
this

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,700
that's fire earlier when Kenny Patterson

47
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,200
told me that they were presenting to the

48
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,040
IRT F and so I was interested if I was

49
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,299
interesting from this from my

50
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:28,040
perspective as a group theorist and a

51
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,390
cryptographer

52
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,590
if something's getting close to

53
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,940
standards it's really time to look at

54
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,420
the script system in a bit more depth so

55
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,079
okay so this protocol has had an earlier

56
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,970
attacks on it

57
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:49,069
so in particular in 2008 there was a TAC

58
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,280
by me out of a coffin Lucia cough using

59
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,170
it something called a length based

60
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,340
attack if you know what that is

61
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,680
we've greatly parameters which were

62
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,090
originally proposed in the paper okay so

63
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,769
this basically says that the parameters

64
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,180
are too small because this length base

65
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,910
attack scales very badly

66
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,629
so in fact Donald's recommended

67
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:13,280
introduced increasing the parameter

68
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,170
slide size you slightly and that would

69
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,930
that would avoid this attack so it's not

70
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,220
in some sense a particularly serious

71
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,280
attack because there's an easy and easy

72
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,630
remedy but more or less at the same time

73
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,829
and into Jaime 2008 there was a more

74
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:37,090
serious attack due to Calcutta Corinne 7

75
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,900
which really break the steam

76
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,450
convincingly for generic parameters so

77
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,769
what don't mean by generic parameters

78
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:46,069
the one of the things of strange about

79
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:48,950
the algebraic eraser is that a choice of

80
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,709
certain parts of the of the public key

81
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,919
parameters of the scheme the algorithm

82
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,660
for generating these public parameters

83
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,639
isn't a specified by me by the scheme

84
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,349
just saying make you choose these things

85
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:04,579
I thought not said how so as a crypt

86
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,750
analyst you're kind of in a weird

87
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,459
difficult situation right because it's

88
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:10,190
security by under specification so all

89
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,739
you could do well all they did was say

90
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:14,239
well okay as choose these things at

91
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,329
random subject to being to all the

92
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,160
publicly known

93
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,829
straight so that so it's a convincing

94
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,950
attack of these generic parameters and

95
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,370
this was responded to in a paper by gold

96
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,500
Falcon girls a preprint we've said

97
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,330
basically you could avoid the attack by

98
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,360
careful choice of system parameters okay

99
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,310
so I'll give a bit more detail about

100
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,750
about that in a second

101
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,870
so there it is so and what's this work

102
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,790
about it's an attack that recovers the

103
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:51,100
key for 128 bit parameters the

104
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,310
parameters are provided by secure RF in

105
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,550
just eight hours on a single core in

106
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,400
magma ticking oh that's cool right so I

107
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,270
can't really imagine a more convincing

108
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:08,080
attack on on the scheme there again so

109
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,320
I'll give a bit more detail about this

110
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,100
now so it's quite a technical scheme in

111
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,350
lots of ways they had to break a razor

112
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,660
so I can't give all the details of the

113
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,100
20-minute talk so I'll try to keep it as

114
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,380
non-technical as I can so algebraic your

115
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,280
ways of diffie-hellman it's a key

116
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,390
agreement scheme just like different

117
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:33,130
same kind of protocol flow there are two

118
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,590
parameters that are picked first of all

119
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,140
128-bit parameters we have n which is 16

120
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,230
and these are n by n matrices okay the

121
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,350
part scheme and Q is 256 q is a field

122
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,919
size so these are the these are 16 plus

123
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,680
16 matrices whose entries are elements

124
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,940
of a finite field that just fits inside

125
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:58,450
a byte okay eight bits and now in

126
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,220
diffie-hellman the things that are

127
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,870
passed between the two parties are

128
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,140
interested modulo P classically so here

129
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,550
are not integers they're actually pairs

130
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,830
the first thing is a matrix M which is

131
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,990
the M by M matrix with entries in GF Q

132
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,080
and the second thing is a permutation

133
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,700
right this is just a permutation of n

134
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,500
objects in this case 16 objects

135
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,120
okay right so what happens is different

136
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,680
size protocol what happens Alice

137
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,660
generates some private information which

138
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,800
I'll come to in a second all right

139
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,780
Alice then computes the public key which

140
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,780
is a matrix M a and a permutation Sigma

141
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,800
a from loading it sends that to Bob Bob

142
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,120
does a similar thing he generates

143
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,490
private information in some way uses

144
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,040
this to compute a public key ten sister

145
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,500
Alice and then what both parties do is

146
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,750
compute a shared value matrix m and

147
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,000
permutation Sigma by using the

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,560
information provided by the party and

149
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,940
the information they've generated

150
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,490
privately I see very similar to D for

151
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,640
helmet this level apart from your the

152
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,750
things are transmitting from one side to

153
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,210
the other

154
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,160
okay now in fact the way it works is a

155
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,140
signal is actually computable by anybody

156
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,380
so Sigma isn't really a a private

157
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,730
information at all so you would take em

158
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,320
and you're trying to derive the shared

159
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,600
key from em right so M is the shared key

160
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,560
right a Sigma's your something that you

161
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,360
sort of used to compute M and then you

162
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,250
can throw away because it's public okay

163
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,940
right so right it's a group based scheme

164
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:40,550
and so I'm going to talk about now the

165
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,990
private information that Alice and Bob

166
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,390
use to generate their public key and

167
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,540
this is this isn't it part of an

168
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,820
infinite group probably impolitic rubes

169
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,830
this is equivalent to sort of the group

170
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,540
in the exponent in TV Hellman right -

171
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,979
faster better the integers under

172
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:57,050
addition or integers modulo P minus 1

173
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,350
something like that so here the

174
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,120
equivalent to the expert group in the

175
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,180
exponent is a colored bar our group it's

176
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,680
got this sort of cool symbol here

177
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,040
there's a semi direct product GD n fq t

178
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,840
went to CN similar product to symmetric

179
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,419
coupon n letters now your group theorist

180
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:16,160
that's fine I'm going to tell you what

181
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,410
this is this is a group the elements of

182
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,360
the group are pairs of matrices m and

183
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,120
Sigma Sigma sister imitators before now

184
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,340
amis an N by n matrix but he's entries

185
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,430
are in in FQ

186
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,960
they're quotients of polynomials in the

187
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,159
vein of variables t1 up to TN right so

188
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,020
this is a this is a infinitely many

189
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,460
possibilities for these things that is

190
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,289
something I'm in for the group so these

191
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:43,320
are the elements and to multiply them so

192
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,610
you multiply these two elements an

193
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,710
element is a pair and sigma2 multiply

194
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,540
two these things together you just

195
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,330
compose the two permutations right that

196
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,000
bits easy how do you get how do you

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,380
multiply two you make well you what you

198
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,430
think you might multiply the two

199
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,230
matrices together but first of all what

200
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,600
you do to one of the matrices is you

201
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,520
just perm you to the variables team up

202
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,529
to TN by using the permutation Sigma

203
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:09,690
first right so if Sigma map to one to

204
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,910
two you replace all the things in which

205
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,610
were whichever team won in the matrix by

206
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,610
t2 first before you did multiplication

207
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,010
so this is a color Barbaro group and

208
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,660
this is related to some sort of

209
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,980
topological group theory study by okay

210
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,029
right so this is the most technical

211
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,380
slides if you can get through this slide

212
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,140
it's so you know it's a nice easy slide

213
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,410
down towards the end of the talk right

214
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,650
okay so remember the things were passing

215
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,070
between a Skip Barber matrices with

216
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,480
entries and FQ so how do you get from

217
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,920
these infinite matrices with Paula

218
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,959
Hammond entries into entries modulo Q

219
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,370
there's an obvious kind of way of doing

220
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,870
it you just replace all the entries of

221
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,200
the variables t1 to TN in your matrix by

222
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,970
particular values call them let's say

223
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,480
tall one up to Torian in FQ okay that

224
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,640
gives you a matrix with entries in FQ

225
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,940
and if you do this in the right way you

226
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,140
get a map down to GL n Q okay so I say

227
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,520
this isn't for the whole of this general

228
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,390
linear group because you've got to have

229
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,459
some condition on the subgroup so that

230
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,980
this actually is a map ok there we go

231
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,020
so this is some map Phi so so now this

232
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,220
is equivalent in difficult

233
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,180
exponentiation

234
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,890
right you take an entry in s pi in omega

235
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,180
that's the thing you're gonna pass that

236
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,440
was in four words form Alice and Bob

237
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,240
and have you saw the x-blocks bogan

238
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,300
thing which is a matrix and a

239
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,819
permutation in this being infinite group

240
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:44,199
we do find something called what the

241
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:46,930
authors calls emulsification right

242
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,269
should be star notation we should

243
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:50,980
combine these two things these kind of

244
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,889
like exponentiation the permutation

245
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:55,149
thing again is very easy you just

246
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:59,680
compose the two permutations right you

247
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,689
kind what you do is you well you there's

248
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:02,740
the simplest thing that you think of

249
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,800
taking the matrix m and you evaluate it

250
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,680
to get a matrix with entries over FQ and

251
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,199
just do normal matrix multiplication but

252
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:13,480
before you evaluate it you permute the

253
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,769
variables of the matrix by using the

254
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:19,180
permutation pi it's a little twist so

255
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,269
that's a multiplication and then what

256
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:24,639
okay then how do you do how you how to

257
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,319
actually do the protocol in more detail

258
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,899
you first of all to choose commuting

259
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:30,639
subgroups of am a and b in the color

260
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,170
purple' algorithm what's commuting mean

261
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,269
it means if you take any a a and b and b

262
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,500
then a big equals b a right so you could

263
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,470
produce them in some way and the the

264
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,540
authors of the scheme don't tell you how

265
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,990
to do this right and then you do the

266
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,670
same you take two countries commuting so

267
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,430
it's C and D of G lnq you choose them in

268
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,519
some way the author the author of the

269
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,720
scheme don't tell you how to do this

270
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,720
right what Alice does is pick something

271
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,390
from the matron infinite group element

272
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,680
from a and a matrix in C and sends

273
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,680
something to Bob she takes the peridot

274
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,240
me get which is the identity matrix and

275
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,830
the identity permutation star multiplies

276
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,240
it with them from the element area it's

277
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,060
kind of like an exponentiation and then

278
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,290
multiplies it on the other side by the

279
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,960
matrix see what this this means it's

280
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,210
just you've got make from centers in F Q

281
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,250
you just multiply and so there was

282
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,690
nothing stomach makasian this matrix

283
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,850
become a permutation you kind of ignore

284
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,250
the permutation and multiply that matrix

285
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,770
C by that first matrix and replace that

286
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,290
mean product that's just basically

287
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,170
matrix product but ignoring the second

288
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,280
entry right Bob picks the same thing put

289
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,460
picks put a bit picks D and D and B in B

290
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,270
so B is an entry this big group these

291
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,730
just a matrix and sends this thing to

292
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,790
balance and then the share common key

293
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,460
you just do the same operation to the

294
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,710
thing you asyou you received they've got

295
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,220
an exponentiation style operation so so

296
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,990
Bob takes the information he gets from

297
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,080
Alice multiplies it on the right by

298
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,070
start B and on the left by D and just

299
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,600
because these things commuted everything

300
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,250
seems to work that's the same as what

301
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,230
Alice does Alice just takes information

302
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,290
she gets from Bob Stallman prices by a

303
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,610
and most part on the left by C

304
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,400
she looks oh I can see that we your kind

305
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,380
of spirits sank about there I think a

306
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,670
seagull faces

307
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,200
that's the aim of the technical bits of

308
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,030
the slide really the main thing is

309
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,430
interested is you pick some random stuff

310
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:47,569
subgroups a b and c in d in some way ok

311
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:56,700
right so how does the calcutta code sab

312
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,610
an approach work this is the previous

313
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,610
attack well as anniversary you get the

314
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,410
main factor basically parameters of the

315
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,450
scheme which are the size of expertise

316
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,690
in the field size q and these elements

317
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,790
tour either used to evaluate everybody

318
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,110
has to evaluate at various stage it's

319
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:18,600
not to do this tunnel vacation and you

320
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,750
would also get some public information

321
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,410
which is the generator matrix c of

322
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,120
matrices and the circle of a or the

323
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,540
caliber outward now this is a unusual

324
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,240
schema that the public parameters for

325
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,920
alice are slightly different than public

326
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,110
parameters for bob right different

327
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,690
matrices where bob uses a group b of

328
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,430
matrices honestly probably bigger than

329
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,040
all about good but in order to

330
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,170
interactive but a thing we've got access

331
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,420
to one of them so we just assumed it not

332
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,510
one we don't need both and he obviously

333
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,980
gets the stuff that's transmitted

334
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,390
backwards and forwards between Alice and

335
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,900
Bob and the aim of course is to complete

336
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,170
the shaky and how does the attack work

337
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,760
it generates lots of elements from a and

338
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,460
uses those elements from a to find

339
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,430
linear information about the secret

340
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,550
information D and a matrix part of the

341
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,320
secret empirical secret group ever be

342
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,270
that Bob uses to generate the to his

343
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,300
public key and it's actually and once

344
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,320
you've got collected enough of these

345
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,630
relations these linear information you

346
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,240
can name find D up to a scaler right the

347
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,330
matrix that Bob uses up to a scaler

348
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,900
okay generically that's phase one and

349
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,660
then phase two uses some clever

350
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,220
algorithm from permutation group theory

351
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,330
to find some equivalent element a dashed

352
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:52,650
with the same in in this group a with

353
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:57,360
the same permutation that has the pair

354
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,870
that was transmitted from Alice to Bob

355
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,090
and these two pieces of information are

356
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,500
enough to derive a shared key turned out

357
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,880
now both of these phases are heuristic

358
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,710
but they're practical for random system

359
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:16,050
parameters so gun doesn't go for

360
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,520
responded to this attack and their

361
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,050
attack basically said that their

362
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,690
response is saying ah choose C very

363
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,580
carefully we haven't said this before

364
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,010
but actually the choose C carefully and

365
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,390
what happens here is if you choose see

366
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,800
carefully all this linear information

367
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,180
basically collapses you don't get enough

368
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,700
linear relations so you don't even

369
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,160
though in generic parameters this the

370
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,630
information gives you the up to a scalar

371
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,580
it's carefully chosen something to see

372
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,420
it doesn't give you enough information

373
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,710
okay so how does a new approach work

374
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,210
right you use the same information as

375
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,160
before right the public parameters

376
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,210
Alice's public information and the

377
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,110
information transmitted between Alice

378
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,360
and Bob in phase zero it's called

379
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,100
silicon SRIA pre-computation phases

380
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,349
before you've gets this last piece of

381
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,780
information you can you've generated

382
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,520
lots of words in the generators of a

383
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,470
who's associated permutation is trivial

384
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,000
which is quite similar to one of the

385
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,319
phases in the in the previous attack and

386
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,640
then once you've got some this at this

387
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,510
extra stuff and phase one Alice finds a

388
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,280
group element a twiddles

389
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,060
whose permutation agrees with a cry at

390
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,920
you can see she knows this because of a

391
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,390
permutation that you have greeting with

392
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,790
a to get from this piece of information

393
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,070
which you transmitted from Alice to Bob

394
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,140
but rather than finding the secret

395
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,160
information D she actually tries to find

396
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,960
the secret information seized up more

397
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,870
stuff to do

398
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,760
this is to do this generates more linear

399
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,560
relations different kind of linear

400
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,260
relations who use it this part is very

401
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,070
different to the calculate el ataque

402
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,270
which is found this she recovers the

403
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,390
remaining parameters in this yenki

404
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,790
now all they all phases in this

405
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,830
algorithm again a heuristic but they're

406
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,690
practical and there's a key difference

407
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,970
which they don't depend on the choice of

408
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,260
this sub we've seen they completely

409
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,040
blind to that choice so the door for

410
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,050
girls attack is completely bypassed by

411
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:22,370
this new approach right alright so right

412
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,280
what's the outcome from this oh I should

413
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,080
say that the these things places here

414
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,700
well we use this same permutation group

415
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,450
algorithm from the previous attack

416
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,610
consequence attack well it's QRF gave it

417
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,000
very kindly gave us five 128-bit

418
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,380
parameters sets so to five challenges

419
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,420
and and the civilian way where you can

420
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,280
look at analyze the scheme right because

421
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,560
otherwise they because we don't know how

422
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,810
these parameters are generated range but

423
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,840
they only provided them to us and

424
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,460
unfortunately you're not into effort for

425
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,050
them and I'm not into optimized

426
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,130
implementation team magma

427
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,620
on a single get to gigahertz core gave

428
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,420
an attack of eight hours and actually a

429
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,060
half of this of free computation right

430
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,680
so phase zero takes about four hours and

431
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,880
the remaining stuff takes about four

432
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,030
hours

433
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,010
so this also makes the ISO tag

434
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,260
authentication protocol that's proposed

435
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,850
by which is very vulnerable to the

436
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:26,530
attack pretty efficient attack very

437
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,350
first attack it's been an interesting

438
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,650
response from secure RF extremely

439
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,130
defensive response so they're they're

440
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,200
sort of very negative in their tone and

441
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,210
also they say some very strange things

442
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,760
technically so for example they say that

443
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,230
the attack has only limited focus

444
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,840
because all it does is recover the C

445
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:53,169
shaky an interesting idea of what

446
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:54,940
anniversary from key agreement protocol

447
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,250
is right they also say it doesn't apply

448
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,650
many times because the adversities

449
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,700
assumed to know the public keys right

450
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,919
yeah and of course if you don't know the

451
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:10,480
public keys you can you can use the

452
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,340
symmetric technique so I have a security

453
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,660
model so it's and there are and actually

454
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,910
most of the time it spends its time

455
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,440
trashing a conjecture attributed to us

456
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,270
that we didn't make very strange I mean

457
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,980
I'm not sayin aliy I would be

458
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,720
embarrassed I will be embarrassed to

459
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,059
producers paper certainly cryptography

460
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:33,280
company I'd be supported surprised that

461
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,910
it would publish this

462
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,690
so certainly I cannot recommend using

463
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,070
the algebraic arranger primitive any

464
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,330
applications right clearly right also

465
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,550
I'd say independent security analysis is

466
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,590
vital right in this case there's a

467
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,300
company that's generating parameters not

468
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,260
saying how these parameters are

469
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,750
generated and it comes up with these

470
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,060
kind of responses so he knocks my

471
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,010
confidence in what they're saying

472
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,480
technically whether it's going to be

473
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,160
true it needs to be verified

474
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,740
independently so independent security

475
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,860
now is absolutely vital there's some

476
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,560
further discussion on this a great type

477
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,790
of why algebraic arrangement may be

478
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,080
there whiskey's crypto system you've

479
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,680
never heard of right by damn good in in

480
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,910
ARS technica it's a lovely article

481
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,080
actually dangoon have got a very high

482
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,570
respect it was very careful to get

483
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,890
accurate quotes from all the parties

484
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,140
involved all right say but he was very

485
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,000
very careful technically so I've got a

486
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,170
lot respect for the way you wrote that

487
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,540
articles that's a good article that's

488
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,650
also I think a very nice effect on

489
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,450
cryptography Stack Exchange which talks

490
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,530
about this I should say that Matt

491
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,480
Robshaw and myself have got a paper in I

492
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,550
a CNS just earlier this year but keeps a

493
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,830
real-time canal systems ISO protocol

494
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,730
okay so it's faster there is a new

495
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,060
proposed that iso protocol after this

496
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,050
where they've added some hash but my

497
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,230
worry is that the techniques form this

498
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,620
paper but with we've met and the paper

499
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,390
presented here a combination them will

500
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,480
apply to this new proposal okay so my

501
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,140
worry is that the the certainly I think

502
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,330
it would be a surprising that they're

503
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,970
proposing an ISO protocol Sandin at such

504
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,030
an early stage right I don't see

505
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,490
anything from the standard saying why

506
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,760
this protocol is not resistant to these

507
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,220
kind of techniques it's very surprising

508
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,920
that they've done this I wouldn't worry

509
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,720
I think so you borrowed me

510
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,520
okay thank you very much
