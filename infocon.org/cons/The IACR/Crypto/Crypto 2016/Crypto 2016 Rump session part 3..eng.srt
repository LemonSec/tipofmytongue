1
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,460
thank you right so as we were

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,020
regurgitating now this is de cycling

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,530
we're good at cycling we you know we the

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,420
French quarters cheats last time to be

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,240
applied too much technology we could

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,710
call his cheeks again but anyway we're

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,340
winning lots of medals and real-world

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,619
crypto it there for a few years there

9
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:30,279
has been a little bit of a competition

10
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,290
between crypto and real world crypto to

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,660
decide which is the bigger crypto

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,420
conference it held every year and I

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,570
think crypto this year has won it but we

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,510
want to make sure that in New York real

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,730
world crypto wins it for 2017 so we

16
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,469
would like you all to turn up to real

17
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:50,230
world crypto in 2017 for those of you

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,219
who don't know what it's about

19
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,469
it's works about real world and crypto

20
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:58,410
so there we go and it needs you okay so

21
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,250
kind of hundred year old advert we need

22
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,519
to you four contributed talks

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,800
sponsorship and left Jim Prize

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,690
nomination so for those of you don't

25
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,399
understand any of these things let me

26
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:14,649
explain what's going on we have

27
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:17,200
contributed talks so not what's the cool

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,000
thing about real world crypto as we bet

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,860
everybody who talks so we can guarantee

30
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,229
you everyone is a good speaker and is

31
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:24,369
talking about something really

32
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,770
interesting it's bit the same way like

33
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,000
Kenny's done the rump session which is

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,709
why the rub set and multi and why the

35
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:31,300
rub session is so good is because

36
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,990
they've done the vetting okay so so not

37
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,459
need to we invite people to talk at

38
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:37,690
real-world crypto you can also

39
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,479
contribute a tilt or suggest a talk and

40
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,789
the deadline for submissions is October

41
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:45,940
the first paper submissions can be full

42
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,310
ten page papers a short two-page

43
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,280
abstract presentation slides or just I'm

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,340
cool can I give a talk type thing might

45
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,840
not really take those ones seriously but

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,929
there we go but anyway we'll all you've

47
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:00,130
got to do is explain what your talks

48
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,170
going to be about and we will then vet

49
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,119
them and we might give you an invite and

50
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:05,770
you can come along and present your

51
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,220
wares to a wide community of academics

52
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,470
and industrialists is about sixty

53
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,260
percent of the people there are

54
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,280
academics and about forty percent are

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,520
from industry so it's a pretty nice

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,770
balance a talking of industry we're

57
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,030
looking for sponsors putting on a

58
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,100
conference of 500 people is very

59
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,780
expensive a lot of you paid a lot of

60
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,300
money to come here the registration fees

61
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,460
for real world crypto are tiny the

62
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,470
reason we do this is we get shed loads

63
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,140
of money from industry shed loads is at

64
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,880
a proper objective to use when you come

65
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,770
to money you may have noticed it's a

66
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,360
kind of English thing we have shed loads

67
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,220
of money all the time if you want to

68
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,800
donate a shed loads of money please talk

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,250
to me or Kenny or Dan bond a and we will

70
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,710
we will gladly take the money off you

71
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,830
okay

72
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,570
quicker than you can just basically say

73
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,270
no so please give us it we really need

74
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,210
your money I must stress otherwise poor

75
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,980
academics are going to have to pay

76
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,960
reasonable registration fees and they

77
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,060
don't like doing that so if you're

78
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,590
sitting next to industrialists and

79
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,960
you're in academic get them to get their

80
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,090
checkbook out now right okay

81
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,330
the but you've got there something in it

82
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,880
for you as well because someone has put

83
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,790
their money their hand into their pocket

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,550
and given as a shedload of money to give

85
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,580

86
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,360

program committee and one of those

111
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,030
people there is not a cryptographer and

votes the who is not the cryptographer

113
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:44,300
top left top right whose votes top right

114
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,020

115
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,150
bastards bottom right okay someone

116
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,990
serious okay anyways thank you very much

117
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:06,060
New York Oh Columbia Columbia yeah okay

118
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,819
thank you very much so we're now going

119
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:15,029
to have a special talk a real-time

120
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:17,069
rebuttal of a previous room session talk

121
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:20,310
by the man who already did his little

122
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,639
dance and now he does something all

123
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,870
right oh thank you for giving me this

124
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,310
opportunity to speak out of folders so

125
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,279
as you know recently the National

126
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,520
Science Foundation captured a

127
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,069
requirement that for postdoc you need to

128
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:40,860
sent a postdoc mentoring plan and

129
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,099
recently I got some extra experience in

130
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:46,879
this so I'm just going to give you some

131
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,430
golden rules about postdoc training so

132
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,819
there are not too many so first ask him

133
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,710
to play tennis at seven o'clock every

134
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,020
morning so it's very effective it's very

135
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,690
you know it's good for your cardio and

136
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,110
otherwise also good for the postdoc ask

137
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,110
him to publicize text messages and to

138
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,090
him of a private channel

139
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,300
so this is kind of to prepare for

140
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,729
cryptanalysis ask him to give funnier um

141
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:19,590
sessions of the expense of his advisor

142
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,570
so that's very appreciated well um last

143
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,580
but not the least I think it's actually

144
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,860
I learned that on my own experience

145
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,350
asked him to face to save food for

146
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,990
during opening receptions of cryptic

147
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:48,510
conferences that's it so next up will be

148
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,760
mo to Jung who will be representing

149
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,919
Belgium in the ping pong competition at

150
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,020
the same time Lily Chen please get ready

151
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,520
okay so this is also a rebuttal

152
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,860
it's a rebuttal to the song that we just

153
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,340
heard about believing in q type

154
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,790
assumptions and so on

155
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,710
yeah and it's a ping pong but a very

156
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,310
short ping pong game

157
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,710
it's about non interactive commitment so

158
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,760
which is essentially a primitive

159
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,940
determinate public say if you put

160
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,410
something in the safe and then you can

161
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,060
open it and everybody knows it's there

162
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,210
and it has to be the property of not

163
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,340
hinting but hiding and binding and

164
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,190
originally it was done for a beat or for

165
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,550
one value but it makes sense to combine

166
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,670
it with various data structures and have

167
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,050
more complicated commitments and there

168
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,440
are non generalization an extension so

169
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,700
concise vector commitment that's like a

170
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,210
lot of data committed in a in small

171
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,720
values an application is your knowledge

172
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,450
databases which queries polynomial

173
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,560
commitments that you kind of commit to

174
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,070
polynomial values and then reveal

175
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,510
valuations and so on and then

176
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,169
accumulators an older construction in

177
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:32,929
which you can accumulate like hash that

178
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,880
accumulated accumulate results and in

179
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,510
all these areas there are remaining

180
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,700
questions which are about the efficiency

181
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,480
and the assumptions so a lot of the

182
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,970
efficient implementations rely on this q

183
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,220
type non constant size assumption that

184
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,210
if you query many times it's still you

185
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,339
know anyway you heard about those

186
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:02,930
beliefs before so so there are remaining

187
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,610
questions in this areas and and and they

188
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,390
kind of look to us a little bit a little

189
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,860
bit

190
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,750
under the same umbrella so we suggested

191
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,209
the generalization is a functional

192
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:21,209
commitment to all of them and in order

193
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,820
to exploit all these all these

194
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,060
similarities and and look at it in a

195
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,860
more abstract level in a way that it

196
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,290
will be a helpful and then one solution

197
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,350
will lead to answering other other

198
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,420
questions in in the related commitment

199
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:42,449
and and the idea is that revealing the

200
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,209
commitment in the functional commitment

201
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,389
does not reveal the value but reveal

202
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,490
function of the value and the hiding is

203
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,990
relative to hiding the the potential

204
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,769
messages that corresponds to pre images

205
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:10,139
of these values okay and and and we

206
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,910
consider in particular all these areas

207
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,410
the dysfunctionality for linear

208
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,310
functions and we have a construction

209
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,139
functional commitment for linear

210
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,240
function based on composite order

211
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,050
pairing commitment size is this constant

212
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,420
and the key size is linear it's

213
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,519
perfectly hiding it's computationally

214
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,810
binding it constant size the assumptions

215
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,810
which is the important things to make

216
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,569
our belief in what we are doing stronger

217
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:53,459
or the belief we care and therefore the

218
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:57,329
result stronger and it employs the DES

219
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:00,089
akyuu framework for proof from Jason

220
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:04,079
Michael John and we and this immediately

221
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,709
needs to concise vector commitment with

222
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:10,230
order and public key which was open in

223
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,620
this area under these implementations

224
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,839
when we look at polynomial commitments

225
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:21,779
we get the first pairing base polynomial

226
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,640
commitment from constant size assumption

227
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,920
when we translate it

228
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,019
linear commitment to values of

229
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,660
polynomial and apply the previous result

230
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,070
and from polynomial commitments to we go

231
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,519
to accumulators and we get the first

232
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,860
pairing based construction from static

233
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,829
assumption so again it strengthened

234
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:47,329
we're believing the construction and

235
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:51,860
less belief on I mean weaker assumptions

236
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:58,829
and and we get accumulators that support

237
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:00,810
subset queries for certain of the data

238
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,810
structure games we need subset queries

239
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:07,010
and gives extension to large universe

240
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:11,610
accumulators pairing based accumulator

241
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,820
with short inclusion witness security

242
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,040
from constant size assumption again not

243
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,920
the queue type and this last result

244
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,600
requires an extension of the queue

245
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,190
framework so now we have much more

246
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,070
belief that you can have these data

247
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:37,350
structures in the various domains based

248
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,089
on better assumptions and better

249
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:47,160
efficiency so thank you very much it's

250
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,790
available only through

251
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:59,080
okay so next up it's going to be Lily

252
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,680
femme on behalf of NIST and David please

253
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:12,820
get ready okay so now mr. P QC team sold

254
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,400
to the third Shaolin ticket out come to

255
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,600
the this room and akiva announcement so

256
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,080
what a kind of game this is pqc post

257
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:29,050
quantum cryptography so needs to publish

258
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:35,140
the Federal Register notice in August to

259
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,680
just about two weeks ago and this

260
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,330
announcement is to request for political

261
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,779
comments our requirements under

262
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:51,670
evaluation criteria about post quantum

263
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,260
cryptography standardization so this

264
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,670
time is different

265
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,950
the the Qing rule is a little bit

266
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,180
different and so the Federal Register

267
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,339
notice only have this request for public

268
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:14,100
comment the proposed requirements and

269
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,220
evaluation criteria is in a website so

270
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,070
is nice Italica /pq crypto so the

271
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:32,140
timeline is September 16th so okay this

272
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,020
is not a competition and there is more

273
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,500
than a competition so why we are seeing

274
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,580
that because in this standardization the

275
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,630
scope is not a single block cipher or a

276
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:51,089
single hash function this is about a

277
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:54,339
digital signature here at abolishment

278
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:56,220
and the key

279
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,850
public-key basic encryption so in this

280
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,730
car we have the proposed requirements I

281
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,400
really like it to get a attention that

282
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,580
in these requirements we have secure

283
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,550
definitions and we have the security

284
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,670
strengths the secured students is not

285
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,210
only for the classical secure students

286
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:25,680
but for the quantum secure strengths so

287
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,670
we like to just to like to know your

288
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:34,140
opinion so this is a timeline it's about

289
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:39,450
the seven-year timeline so by the next

290
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,980
Olympic game

291
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,350
we are still in the mid middle of this

292
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,860
competition or not our competition so

293
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,890
the first step is we wanted to publish a

294
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:58,860
former car for some proposals so the

295
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,090
then the first step first and so we

296
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,160
wanted to know what do you think about

297
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,800
these requirements this is like a

298
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,400
straining pool the swimming game the

299
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,010
water is deep for the poster quantum

300
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:18,000
cryptography so remember the tideland is

301
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,530
about one month from today and thank you

302
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,610
thank you so next up will is David and

303
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,220
Evo please get ready cool thanks for the

304
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,589
intro so I'm going to talk to you about

305
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:40,970
some of our recent work on functional

306
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,899
encryption is this trying were

307
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:44,959
requesting so well we're all playing a

308
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,670
crypto Olympic Games so venetie's coming

309
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,079
our friends here they're all happily

310
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,390
competing everyone's having fun but then

311
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,220
the Donald comes along and he's not

312
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,769
happy he's like I didn't win well what

313
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:56,510
does the tonneau do well he goes on to

314
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,010
his favorite messaging platform and

315
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,390
complains that everything is rigged

316
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,579
against him so the question is is the

317
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:03,079
Olympic Games rigged against the Donald

318
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,490
and how can we help the download out

319
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,199
well one thing we can do is we can audit

320
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,880
the records let's say that all of the

321
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,650
competitors they take all their health

322
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,480
records they publish them we take a

323
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,099
random sample of them we check if

324
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,290
there's any suspicious activity going on

325
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,750
well as cryptographers we're cautious

326
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,520
about the privacy right we don't want to

327
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,750
publish all of our health records and

328
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,660
we're clear so let's use crypto let's

329
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,550
encrypt the records so now what is our

330
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,829
problem reduced to well the abstract

331
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,720
formulation of our problem can be like

332
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,280
well following how do we stand for a

333
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,929
random record from an encrypted database

334
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:35,240
this seems like it falls under a general

335
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,460
umbrella a functional encryption so in a

336
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,410
functional encryption scheme secret keys

337
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,000
are associated with a function f and

338
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,309
basically given a ciphertext or an

339
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:45,260
encryption of a message m and a secret

340
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,820
key for F you apply the decryption

341
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,370
operation and magic you get the function

342
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,669
evaluation at the message but an actual

343
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:54,380
question then becomes what happens if

344
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,150
this function is randomized what if this

345
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,830
function takes in some random points and

346
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,720
especially in our case that we're trying

347
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,460
to audit an encrypted database we're

348
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,990
sampling a random element and the

349
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,940
integrity of the audit process is fund

350
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,679
is critical that we have you good

351
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:09,440
randomness so what do we do here well

352
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,840
first we have to define a notion so in a

353
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,220
randomized functional encryption scheme

354
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,230
the decryption function is still going

355
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,419
to be a deterministic process it's going

356
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:19,520
to take a message and take a secret key

357
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,230
for a function f that could take random

358
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,450
points and the output of the decryption

359
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,280
function is actually should look like a

360
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,410
random draw from the distribution of the

361
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,640
function evaluated on underlying

362
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,890
plaintext and moreover if we have two

363
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,290
messages encrypted and we apply the same

364
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,059
decryption function which the key got to

365
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:37,370
destroy somehow and we apply the

366
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,350
decryption function it just look like

367
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,540
two independent draws from the function

368
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,740
evaluated on the under

369
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,890
my inputs so we look at this the

370
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,900
question then becomes does do functional

371
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,370
encryption schemes for randomized

372
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,380
functionalities exist and we look at the

373
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,150
setting for deterministic

374
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,590
functionalities it's great

375
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,700
we have scenes from public key

376
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,170
encryption all the way up the screens

377
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,309
using multi linear maps and in

378
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:00,110
distinguishability obfuscation so a wide

379
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,179
variety of constructions based on

380
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:04,190
different kinds of assumptions the story

381
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,540
is much less rosy when we look at

382
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,920
functional encryption schemes for

383
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,600
randomize functionalities in fact we

384
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,250
only only have one construction in a rat

385
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,320
in a public key setting and that's using

386
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,780
this very powerful primitive Association

387
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,820
and we're already only achieve

388
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,280
selectively secure so the natural

389
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,200
question then that we want to ask here

390
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,059
is does extending functional encryption

391
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:24,350
to support this Richard class of

392
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,940
functionalities namely these randomized

393
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,040
functionalities necessitate that we move

394
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,840
to much stronger assumptions such as i/o

395
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,780
and the answer that we were to present

396
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,360
in this work is no in fact we show a

397
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,280
compiler a generic compiler that takes

398
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,780
any general-purpose functional

399
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,070
encryption scheme that works for

400
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,990
deterministic functionalities along with

401
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,790
very mild number theoretic assumptions

402
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,920
such as DDH and RSA and what we produce

403
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,240
it's actually a general-purpose

404
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,890
functional encryption scheme for the

405
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,550
full class of randomized functionalities

406
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,720
so I'm going to give you a very

407
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,250
high-level overview of the construction

408
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,450
and the starting point of our

409
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,370
construction is the randomization we

410
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,600
have to produce the randomness in

411
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,040
somewhere because ultimately we're going

412
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,660
to use a deterministic functional

413
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,010
encryption scheme so where are we going

414
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,540
to get the randomness from well as

415
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,250
proposed first we typically resort to

416
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,380
pseudo-random functions so we're going

417
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,760
to put a key inside the function and

418
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,660
basically evaluate the function using

419
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,070
randomness derived from the PRF and

420
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,530
evaluated on the input this is all good

421
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,630
and all but unfortunately if we look at

422
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,340
normal functional encryption schemes the

423
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,840
secret Keys don't hide the function in

424
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,250
particular the secret key is not going

425
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,110
to hide a key RS key and output of the

426
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,030
PRF is no longer random if you know what

427
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,530
the key is but this actually doesn't

428
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,160
work at all

429
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,590
so the naturalness solution is the

430
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,730
secret share the key we're going to

431
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,530
split the key and give some power to the

432
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,140
encrypter so now the key is there's part

433
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,100
of the key that's built into the

434
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,660
functionality part of the key is

435
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,880
supplied by the encrypter itself if we

436
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,950
do this we get a little closer but this

437
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,570
actually it turns out doesn't quite work

438
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,700
and in particular if we get back to our

439
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,520
original problem of finally what about

440
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,590
it the problem is that the intruder has

441
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,419
way too much control over how he

442
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:58,279
generates the ciphertext and in

443
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:00,200
particular by influencing the choice of

444
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,990
the key or even a random coins used to

445
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,669
generate the cipher text in the

446
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:06,080
underlying functional encryption scheme

447
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,730
he can actually induce very bad

448
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,710
distributions and this actually destroys

449
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,990
the security of the scheme so it turns

450
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,340
out that to actually get the full power

451
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,049
of our construction we require a few

452
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:16,669
more tools and this is where we use the

453
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:19,039
algebraic assumptions so using DDH NRSA

454
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,250
we use like mythic arguments PRF secure

455
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,450
against related key attacks and

456
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,010
technique seaman from deterministic

457
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,720
encryption and this actually allows us

458
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,539
to obtain simulation secure randomized

459
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:30,860
functional encryption from any

460
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,380
simulation secure deterministic

461
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,450
functional encryption and moreover the

462
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,130
key here is that the security properties

463
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,779
of our underlying and fee scheme are

464
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:40,789
preserved so we actually get the first

465
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:42,860
adaptively secure functional encryption

466
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,149
scheme for randomized functionalities

467
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:47,770
thank you and our papers available

468
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,850
next up will be representing the

469
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:59,340
Timelords Evo this map so what happened

470
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,170
is that Kenny told me is that you know

471
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,720
if you're giving a rap session talk it

472
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,640
has to be about the Olympic Games and it

473
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,310
turns out that just a few days ago I was

474
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,830
talking to my friends of Japan and they

475
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,990
say we should move crypto to Tokyo

476
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,870
because in four years times the Olympic

477
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,330
Games will be in Tokyo and then all

478
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,970
people from crypto can attend the

479
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,760
Olympic Games so I talked but yeah

480
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,260
because normally be games in Santa

481
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,680
Barbara

482
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,580
so why actually tie the rim session to

483
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,670
the Olympic Games and then I remembered

484
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,470
there used to be Olympic Games in Santa

485
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,890
Barbara

486
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,480
ok and some of you may remember this and

487
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,580
so the question is is this a joke or

488
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,080
this is a true story and I see some

489
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,060
people in the front row say oh yes we

490
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,550
remember this yes this is actually a

491
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,120
picture of how you see is being used to

492
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,950
look and if you look carefully you

493
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,020
actually see that the the hall Allah

494
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,240
Kappa Hall they're in the back and so

495
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,760
that's how it was transformed not in any

496
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,010
of us saw that no because when we

497
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,830
arrived all this was demolished ok

498
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,280
and so there is an official report it

499
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,260
says official report you can clearly see

500
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,210
that I find the pointer here yeah

501
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,070
official report so where you see

502
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,570
official report this thing is not the

503
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,820
battery anyway so it says official

504
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,400
importance this UCSB was used to house

505
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,380
more than 800 rowing and canoeing

506
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,670
kayaking athletes etc ok and UCSB was a

507
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,740
complete village in terms of services

508
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,210
provided and it's amazing if I would be

509
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,740
given here 20 minutes I'm going to give

510
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,540
a hall talk and all the slides that are

511
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,370
on there it's incredible you see the

512
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,470
campus in a way you have never seen so

513
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,600
go there and look at it it's clearly

514
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,560
really incredible so what the heck is

515
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,990
the link to crypto soon afterwards

516
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:54,540
cryptid 1984 took place at UCSB now what

517
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,970
happened is that Air France was very

518
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,610
smart all the tickets that you try to

519
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,450
buy in Europe to fly to Santa Barbara

520
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,260
Air France had the monopoly on that the

521
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,960
price it costed was the same as flying

522
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,690
from Paris to Los Angeles okay

523
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,750
so if you were on the fly LA to here and

524
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,570
you bought your ticket in Europe yeah it

525
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,300
was crazy expensive and there's a long

526
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:20,840
story

527
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,090
this is just a short version so yes it

528
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,800
was very interesting coming here and

529
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,430
people telling you oh you know just

530
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,160
recently the Olympics were here and yeah

531
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,020
they used to be there I mean now it's

532
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,620
even more crazy do you know that 1984

533
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,310
was that long time ago now you think I

534
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,820
made a mistake some people the first

535
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:50,870
resort this is binary 32 but I think

536
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,090
that we should change and we as computer

537
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,120
stock we as computer scientists should

538
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,030
advocate binary anniversaries why so we

539
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,830
should switch the binary birthdays

540
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,050
because what happens is that if you

541
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,230
switch the binary birthdays then you

542
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,840
have exponentially fast vanishing

543
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,400
birthdays who remembers basically the

544
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,440
yeah the battle in Waterloo okay when

545
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,050
what day was it and what year most

546
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,400
people don't remember it but people

547
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,080
remember the end of World War two

548
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,050
yeah and the next generation yeah maybe

549
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,490
you will no longer remember it so

550
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,380
depending on the importance you will

551
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,520
remember it and by having exponentially

552
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,530
fast vanishing birthdays they will

553
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,560
automatically become irrelevant okay so

554
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,500
who will remember the next time that

555
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,460
means in extra 32 years 64 years after

556
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,640
the event of the Olympic Games we will

557
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,170
talk about the Olympic Games in Santa

558
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,920
Barbara maybe nobody but any make any

559
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,250
thanks for this inspiration I think it

560
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,500
was the great time to do it exactly so

561
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,810
many years after leap begins talk about

562
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,159
on the rim session thank you

563
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:13,970
thank you

564
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:18,690
next up is Susan Langford and Alex

565
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:22,559
please get ready alright I'm here today

566
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,539
to talk to you about derived unique

567
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:27,120
Keeper transaction officially pronounced

568
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,899
da cut and I promise you that I will try

569
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:32,909
to make this talk exactly as exciting as

570
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:34,350
watching our ducks favorite in an

571
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:40,730
Olympic sport golf so dock pot is

572
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,039
asymmetric key derivation protocol that

573
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,080
was developed for payment terminals and

574
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,230
the idea is that you have perfect

575
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,840
forward secrecy in the terminal so when

576
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,450
somebody quietly walks away with the

577
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,730
terminal from Walmart they don't steal

578
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,340
anything of value that's not you don't

579
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,139
have perfect swearword secrecy at the

580
00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:03,210
server you have one key that lets the

581
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,600
server talk to up to 10,000

582
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,080
point-of-sale terminals at a time now it

583
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,759
was originally developed in the 1980s

584
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,049
for single des

585
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,480
it was then kind of hacked to make it

586
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,720
work for triple des and now the ansi x9

587
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,570
f6 financial subcommittee is actually

588
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,580
trying to clean it up and make it use

589
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:29,909
AES in a secure way I am sure that at

590
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:31,200
this point in the evening all of you

591
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,909
really want to go over formulas right

592
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:36,360
yeah all right it's a tree based key

593
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,190
derivation scheme please read the paper

594
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,999
if you care again at the terminal you

595
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:44,249
keep parts of the tree you throw away

596
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:47,970
keys as you use them so what did we

597
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,850
change as we modernize this well some of

598
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,649
it was just pure clean up there was a

599
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:55,619
very lovely 21 bit counter that the

600
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:59,159
programmers just adored we got rid of

601
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,899
that it's a 32 bit counter byte

602
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:04,110
alignment it's some lovely thing we also

603
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,999
and this is the most important part and

604
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:07,379
the reason we want people to look at

605
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:09,409
this we cleaned up the key derivation

606
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:13,169
our key derivation is now based on the

607
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:16,350
nist SP 800 - 108 key derivation

608
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,220
technique we use the counter mode

609
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,280
however as you can see from the very

610
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,620
high-level description I've given you we

611
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,410
do a huge amount of key derivations for

612
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,300
every transaction and every transaction

613
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,470
is 8 bytes 100 bytes max this is a lot

614
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:38,140
of key derivations therefore instead of

615
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,720
using HTML or even C Mac as the

616
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,760
pseudo-random function we are actually

617
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,800
proposing the use of ECB now we

618
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,350
understand ECB is not a pseudo-random

619
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,000
function it is a pseudo-random

620
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,300
permutation however we know that CMAC is

621
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,580
also a pseudo-random permutation when

622
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,830
your key derivation data is a single

623
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,910
block which is what we are using so we

624
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,640
cannot see any security problem with

625
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,430
using ECB in this function but that is

626
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,350
why we've come to you and said please

627
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,630
look at this have we missed something is

628
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,490
there something else we could do this is

629
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,490
almost 2 times faster to do it this way

630
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,400
and when you're talking about 15 key

631
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,310
derivations for 8 bytes of data that's a

632
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:28,750
significant performance impact so we

633
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,270
also have a fun rekeying option that you

634
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,100
could use the last key to send in more

635
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,810
keys because people are encrypting

636
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,580
credit cards now we're we're only

637
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,550
encrypting pins the life of a PIN pad

638
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,620
was very long with credit cards it's a

639
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,630
lot of transactions they just needed an

640
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,670
extension so that's another thing we'd

641
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,320
like some feedback on is that a good

642
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:53,020
idea so this this fact is not quite

643
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,850
finished we will be putting it out on

644
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,860
the web as soon as we get our ducks in a

645
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,070
row this is probably going to be a few

646
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,870
weeks to a month from now but no

647
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,520
guarantees you know how standards bodies

648
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,020
work

649
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,080
the x9 org website will have a copy of

650
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,270
this document if you're interested and

651
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,180
you have any problems email me and I

652
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,040
will tell you where it is or put you on

653
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,840
the list and notify you when we get it

654
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,220
out and get it in a place that you can

655
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,920
find it so thanks

656
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,600
so the next speaker will be Alex his

657
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,140
favorite sport I stood of war and

658
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,520
Hillary please get ready

659
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,890
so apparently tug of war actually was an

660
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,260
Olympic sport back in the day which I

661
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,290
think summarizes multilinear maps very

662
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,860
well so I'll be presenting if this wing

663
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,890
works I'll be presenting a benchmark on

664
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,510
multi-linear map applications this is

665
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,309
joint work with a lot of different

666
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:59,929
people so first I'll mention that it

667
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:02,030
comes out of the DARPA safe wear project

668
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,120
which is a program funded by DARPA to

669
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,830
study cryptographic program obfuscation

670
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,740
and the tools used to develop

671
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,650
obfuscation such as multilinear maps so

672
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,880
the goal here is to understand the

673
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,890
security improve the runtimes as best we

674
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,179
can and more info can be found here so

675
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:21,650
the goal with these benchmarks is to

676
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,300
better understand the concrete security

677
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,790
of multilinear maps and their

678
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,620
applications so what's the required

679
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,290
effort for the known practical attacks

680
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,450
and what are the security parameter

681
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,420
implications of these attacks so the

682
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,250
mechanism of this benchmark is we'll

683
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,660
release a bunch of challenges and

684
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,910
information on how these challenges were

685
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,400
created and the goal of a participant is

686
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,220
to recover the secret and will accept

687
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,900
any submission that demonstrates

688
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,850
recovery and will also rank the

689
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,920
submissions by their efficiency and have

690
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,900
a leaderboard for the most efficient

691
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,400
breaks so the first benchmark is order

692
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,350
reviewing encryption so the basic idea

693
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,090
here is you have a data owner who

694
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,280
encrypts a bunch of plaintext and any

695
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,559
user can compare the plaintext just

696
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,790
using the ciphertext and shouldn't be

697
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,830
able to learn anything else so for this

698
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,140
benchmark we'll release ten cipher texts

699
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,700
and the public parameters use to be able

700
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,880
to compare the cipher text and the goal

701
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,300
of an attacker is to recover a single

702
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,179
plaintext the second benchmark is

703
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:24,950
obfuscation and particular point

704
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,320
function obfuscation so here a data

705
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,270
owner in some sense encrypts a plaintext

706
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,100
and a user can compare quality or

707
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,269
inequality to that plaintext

708
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:35,729
so the benchmark tier is an obfuscation

709
00:32:35,729 --> 00:32:38,129
of some function f where f of X equals 1

710
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:41,789
for all inputs but 1 and the goal is to

711
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:44,839
recover the X such that f of X equals 0

712
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:49,439
so in order to win you have to of course

713
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:51,239
satisfy the requirements of branch mark

714
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:53,659
you have to break the break the scheme

715
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:55,979
you have to make the attack code

716
00:32:55,979 --> 00:32:58,439
publicly available to us we want to

717
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,349
build a repository with a known attacks

718
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:02,999
and we also want to reproduce the

719
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:04,739
attacks on a reference platform so we

720
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:06,569
can get some normalized running time of

721
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:09,539
the break and we also require that you

722
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:11,159
submit by the end of the year although

723
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,109
that can change depending on how like

724
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:16,229
the benchmark is going and we don't

725
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:18,569
actually know what you'll win now but

726
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:20,009
it's some type of recognition award from

727
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:23,129
DARPA either anything from a t-shirt to

728
00:33:23,129 --> 00:33:24,989
a plaque to money we're still deciding

729
00:33:24,989 --> 00:33:28,139
that so some more details about these

730
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,829
two benchmarks so first one is re we

731
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:33,239
consider two multilinear maps

732
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:36,049
GGH alight which is based on g GH 13 and

733
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:41,189
c LT 13 and 40 th light we consider the

734
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:43,769
security parameter of 40 and here what

735
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:46,229
we mean is lambda bits of security it

736
00:33:46,229 --> 00:33:48,049
should take an attacker to to the lambda

737
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:51,299
clock cycles to break these schemes have

738
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,099
a known attack so it will be quicker

739
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:54,539
than that

740
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:57,209
so yeah we have GJ flight at 40 bits of

741
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:58,769
security feel T at 80 bits of security

742
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:01,349
and the same for the point function case

743
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:05,099
when we set the size of the point to the

744
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:08,190
security parameter because these sizes

745
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,279
are quite large I don't expect people to

746
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:12,839
be downloading these from the internet

747
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,809
so I have USB keys available for anyone

748
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:19,649
who's interested I have I think 15 or so

749
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:22,199
so don't use this as an opportunity to

750
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,129
get a free 128 gigabyte USB key but use

751
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:27,809
it as an opportunity to break these

752
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:33,179
schemes more details this is based on a

753
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,768
framework that we developed that's going

754
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:36,719
to be published at CCS it's fully open

755
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,299
source if you want to play with it and

756
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:40,589
the most important slide because this

757
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:41,940
has a website that has a lot more

758
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,389
information

759
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:46,089
an email that you can email us questions

760
00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:49,268
comments concerns anything and the win

761
00:34:49,268 --> 00:34:51,549
and the entries if you have a break and

762
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:52,510
that's it

763
00:34:52,510 --> 00:35:01,450
thanks thank you so next up will be

764
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,760
Hillary Orman she chose a very specific

765
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,369
Olympic discipline namely discipline of

766
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:12,970
quilting so well okay well I don't think

767
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:15,700
that quilting is an Olympic event but

768
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,190
this is more about memory than quilting

769
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,910
and I think that the original Greeks at

770
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:25,720
the time of the Olympic Games would if

771
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,099
they could see forward they'd be very

772
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:30,160
impressed with the Athletics right now

773
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,619
but they would be baffled at how bad we

774
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:35,980
are at memorizing anything I'm a normal

775
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,990
computer user I have a couple of hundred

776
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:42,549
passwords they're probably even too

777
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:44,589
short by today's standards I should go

778
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:47,079
back and make them all longer how in the

779
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:50,589
world can you memorize passwords of that

780
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:54,670
length well we should go back to the the

781
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,380
way the ancient Greeks did it they had

782
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,359
very good memories human memory is

783
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:01,180
excellent it's just kind of hard to

784
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,380
control it so if you want to know about

785
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,269
memory Championships which I really

786
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:09,130
think should be in the Olympics this

787
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,289
book moonwalking with Einstein explains

788
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:16,710
a lot about it so I had an experience

789
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:21,549
here at UCSB and I was looking at the

790
00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:24,490
bedspreads in the dorm which are I think

791
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,440
particularly unattractive and I've seen

792
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,920
them a million times and this is what it

793
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,039
looks like but some for some reason when

794
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,660
I saw it I thought it is a beautiful

795
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,150
thing actually it's got these squares

796
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,029
it's got these extensions it illustrates

797
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:44,049
the formula n plus one squared is n plus

798
00:36:44,049 --> 00:36:47,019
2 n plus 1 I mean it's got all sorts of

799
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:49,269
things going on with it and I found that

800
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:51,670
the next day I perfectly remembered this

801
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:56,180
unmemorable design so I

802
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,329
way of describing it there there are

803
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:02,750
ways of describing geometric things but

804
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:06,349
what I came up with on this was I have

805
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,230
the three square I've got a 5l I've got

806
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:15,079
a 7l I've got 14 dominoes and a 2 square

807
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:17,690
and I googled this and it turns out that

808
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,210
it doesn't correspond to anything on the

809
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,470
Internet

810
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,099
so this is a way of generating fairly

811
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:28,599
long passwords what I like about it is I

812
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:32,630
don't have that character string in my

813
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,940
memory I have not subvocal eyes did at

814
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,250
all what I have is the image and the

815
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:41,089
image leads to the password so I propose

816
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:45,200
this as a possible method for being able

817
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,980
to enter into real password memorization

818
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,400
which seems to be with us forever can

819
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,260
you get enough unique passwords from

820
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,450
this I'm not sure but it is an

821
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,359
exponential problem I think if you go up

822
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,809
to around somewhere under 15 by 15 you

823
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:04,970
probably can get enough tessellations

824
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,910
and variation on it especially if you

825
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,640
preserve the diagonal symmetry I propose

826
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,880
that security conferences have password

827
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,970
memorization contests so people can come

828
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,529
up with more methods like this

829
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:33,950
so next up will be used Sasaki yes and

830
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:43,118
flooding here please get ready so yes so

831
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,920
oops yes

832
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:58,850
there we are okay so direct to talk

833
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,840
about of a new impossible differential

834
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,550
search to and that this is joint work

835
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,790
with my prolly videos yet although so at

836
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,910
first we thought that we made big

837
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,000
results I mean huge results like Titanic

838
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,740
results but we have to report some

839
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,450
methodological region in a later in this

840
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:24,400
talk so impossibly differential has

841
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,290
personal analysis approach for block

842
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:31,940
ciphers and at its core attackers need

843
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,400
to find input difference and out with

844
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,710
difference that can't be connected so

845
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,010
impulsive the differential propagation

846
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,420
so hard to find such impossibly

847
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,990
differential the previous work propagate

848
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,300
input difference in the board at the

849
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,370
same time to propagate the art with the

850
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,380
difference in the backward and try to

851
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,330
find some contradiction in the middle

852
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,460
that approach is called miss in the

853
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,210
middle this approach has similar issues

854
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:03,830
to be improved first the attackers need

855
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:08,200
to encode some contradicting reasons in

856
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,490
advanced which is sometimes difficult

857
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:15,560
and many of the previous work is s box

858
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,860
Wars analysis I mean they didn't

859
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,930
consider insiders VARs due to some

860
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,770
technical difficulties and attackers

861
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:28,130
need to make code to berate impossible

862
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,960
differential just for evil right

863
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,520
impossible differential which is a

864
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,670
time-consuming so in this talk in our

865
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,700
tool we want to solve everything so the

866
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:45,350
result is there get so first our point

867
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,770
of a such tool can find any

868
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:51,290
contradicting reason and our tool can

869
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,260
look inside as works and we can prove a

870
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,030
maximum length of impossible

871
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,790
differential by assuming my layer with

872
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,299
some assumption

873
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:06,229
and their design is a universal I mean

874
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:09,229
the tool for impossible differential can

875
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:11,509
change to standard differential or

876
00:41:11,509 --> 00:41:17,769
linear with slide it's very cheap cost

877
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:22,059
so the runtime is fast like even our

878
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:25,609
algorithm so it is very fast so as fast

879
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:31,699
as single the tool can be applied to

880
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:35,900
many ciphers so it's as versatile Kohei

881
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,630
Uchimura and application is also so

882
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,549
strong so as strong as TD linear and the

883
00:41:43,549 --> 00:41:47,739
to organization that he had my catalyst

884
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:52,729
so what's the idea behind the tool is

885
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:55,609
based on differential being a large we

886
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:58,489
have mixed integer linear programming so

887
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:02,269
in the previous bound starch the input

888
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:05,150
to the tool is a cipher to specification

889
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,910
and then the MLP solvers outputs lower

890
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,259
bound of the number of active as

891
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:12,789
possible in this research we

892
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:15,589
additionally specify in 50 different

893
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:18,890
about the difference then along the my

894
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:23,509
LP 2 so the tool returns some error in

895
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:26,299
sometimes which means system is

896
00:42:26,299 --> 00:42:28,819
invisible that means Delta e and Delta

897
00:42:28,819 --> 00:42:31,429
out does not have any solution so they

898
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:35,479
are impossible so by testing or impotent

899
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:37,249
out quick differences then we can

900
00:42:37,249 --> 00:42:39,529
exhaustively search or impossibility

901
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:43,759
financial and here it's the table for

902
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:46,189
the application results and as you can

903
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:48,499
see that the number of our impossible

904
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,170
differential these three issues were

905
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,289
improved in many snipers or in people in

906
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:57,229
particular we could analyze some ciphers

907
00:42:57,229 --> 00:43:04,249
with 8-bit as boxes and we can prove

908
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,140
maximum length of impossible

909
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,140
differential I don't go into the details

910
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,410
there technically I don't explain the

911
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,079
technical details but just wanted as I

912
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:15,859
like a lot

913
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:20,119
Cypress I buried it here but then some

914
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:23,509
tragedy occurred so we started this

915
00:43:23,509 --> 00:43:26,980
research from May 28th and the research

916
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,589
proceeded in a good pace that in a dry

917
00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:33,859
eleven paper appeared on the imprint the

918
00:43:33,859 --> 00:43:36,140
title is new automatic search tool for

919
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,509
impossibility financial and the robot

920
00:43:38,509 --> 00:43:42,140
from Chinese team so this is a collision

921
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,160
on a research topic and actually I read

922
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,710
the people that this is very people so I

923
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,809
recommend everyone to reading it well I

924
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:54,289
just wanted some make comparison so two

925
00:43:54,289 --> 00:43:58,099
researchers use exactly the same idea in

926
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:05,029
the basic but similar advantage they

927
00:44:05,029 --> 00:44:07,369
have developed their own advantage

928
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:08,809
for example the in evening the paper

929
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:11,809
extends the tool to ARX or zero

930
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:14,079
correlation analysis and they found some

931
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,289
distinction on the hydroxide well we

932
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:20,749
have strong applications and we propose

933
00:44:20,749 --> 00:44:22,940
some techniques to analyze a bit this

934
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,470
box so so the conclusion actually I can

935
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,690
see something this tragic collision but

936
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:34,519
the impact since not so I hope that to

937
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:37,700
research groups have good futures and

938
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,880
yeah I have such a happy end for our

939
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,769
Titanic story thank you for your

940
00:44:42,769 --> 00:44:44,950
attention

941
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,750
so I'm not sure whether iceberg hitting

942
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:54,110
is really an Olympic discipline but so

943
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:58,340
next up will be Vladimir zukov Karev

944
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,800
and after that Ari please get ready for

945
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,690
the very last talk so this will be the

946
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:05,690
penultimate one none of you please okay

947
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:08,990
hello everyone so just a quick pre story

948
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:11,420
I prepared my slides before the

949
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,340
submission was actually due and then all

950
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,620
of a sudden I read that there is

951
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,300
supposed to be an Olympic theme and I

952
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,680
started thinking about it well what

953
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,490
should I do

954
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:21,920
and I realized our founder the hare Olga

955
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,390
Mel has actually taken care of it

956
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,890
because if you look at our logo it has

957
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,020
two of the Olympic rings so I was said

958
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:31,250
there and so now we can go to actual

959
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:35,120
crypto here so what are the some

960
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,740
challenges that we can serve see

961
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,780
nowadays is one of them is vulnerability

962
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,110
due to the lack of diversification so

963
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,640
you know one attack can be widely

964
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,890
devastating if you know there's a lot of

965
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,440
systems that are working on the same

966
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,360
using the same crypto systems it's

967
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,950
easier for adversary's to concentrate on

968
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,260
one scheme so blast games more

969
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,260
concentration for adversary's per scheme

970
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:00,770
and so just naturally higher probability

971
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,870
of being attacked so what a solution

972
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:05,750
well we use cryptographic agility so

973
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:08,120
easily changeable cryptography custom

974
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,550
cryptography and then combination of

975
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,230
cryptography so can construct schemes

976
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,110
and make them unique for each other big

977
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:18,770
organization or even a country another

978
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:22,190
of course threat that is coming up it's

979
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,260
gonna be quantum attacks and as we know

980
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,360
all asymmetric crypto that is currently

981
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,210
been standardized can be broken and what

982
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:31,250
is safe encrypted today will be broken

983
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,930
successfully tomorrow using quantum

984
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,670
computers and if we need long-living

985
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:36,110
secrets then we're in trouble

986
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,900
and the future I mean is fear linear

987
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,280
maybe 15-20 years

988
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,560
and the solution of course is post

989
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,380
quantum cryptography and there's

990
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,540
different approaches but at some point

991
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,700
who said that ECC is gone but no it's

992
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,650
not actually gone if we use I search in

993
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,490
bass fishing loot occurs then

994
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:57,590
ECC survives and we can reuse a lot of

995
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,250
libraries and

996
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,010
use it for future implementations on

997
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,740
massaging based crypto systems all right

998
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:12,750
thank you thank you so now time for the

999
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,860
very last talk of this drum session

1000
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,140
which apparently as a discipline which

1001
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,580
has something to do with smart and

1002
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,550
something to do with screwing so I'm

1003
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:28,970
worried a little bit Ari please go ahead

1004
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:43,860
something is cooled up going back okay

1005
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,350
this is joint work with yellow men and

1006
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,090
the CEO Weingarten

1007
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:51,900
and as you know one of the hottest

1008
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,060
buzzwords today is the Internet of

1009
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:58,740
Things and if you look at which Internet

1010
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,560
of Things have been selling reasonably

1011
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,530
well smart lights and especially the

1012
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:07,200
smart lights made by philips the biggest

1013
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,450
sellers i've been trying to find out

1014
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:12,000
exactly how many smart lights Philips

1015
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,790
had sold they couldn't find any reliable

1016
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:16,770
figures but I assume that they sold at

1017
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:18,720
least hundreds of thousands of them so

1018
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:24,180
far in the last three years okay so this

1019
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:30,030
is the Philips you system and it of

1020
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:31,950
course Philips is one of the world's

1021
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,830
largest corporations and they employ

1022
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,200
thousands of engineers that's a hint to

1023
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,830
the number that solves the puzzle is

1024
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:44,280
that in the title and we decided to test

1025
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,760
the actual security of the system so

1026
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,280
I'll give you a crash course of one

1027
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,170
minute about what what's involved each

1028
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,720
installed light that you screw into the

1029
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,700
socket is connected to a central

1030
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,360
controller wirelessly using the protocol

1031
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,340
which is very important in IOT that's

1032
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,680
probably one of the main protocols that

1033
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,650
will be news it's called ZigBee

1034
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:13,770
the ZigBee lightly zll by the way in

1035
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:15,960
israel it means dead but that's a

1036
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,610
different story is enabling the

1037
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:24,110
controller to send instructions to the

1038
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:27,690
smart light the light controller itself

1039
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:29,900
is connected to your secure home office

1040
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,700
Wi-Fi network or you can also connect it

1041
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,690
through a wire and you use your smart

1042
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,540
phone in order to issue instructions you

1043
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:44,790
can ask each light to turn on or off or

1044
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,460
to increase or decrease the intensity or

1045
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,910
change the color etc very nice and

1046
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:53,520
convenient system now how about the

1047
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,180
security it uses all kinds of clever

1048
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:01,950
cryptographic schemes look solid in

1049
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:05,390
particular the way you initialize it and

1050
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:07,110
associate it with a particular

1051
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:11,040
controller is to bring the controller to

1052
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,560
within 10 to 20 centimetres from the

1053
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,950
smart light otherwise from further away

1054
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:20,430
it's not supposed to to obey any

1055
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,260
instructions this is only initially

1056
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,870
after it had been paired together with

1057
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:27,180
the controller you can move the

1058
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,430
controller to a different room and still

1059
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:33,210
control the smart light ok so they have

1060
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,970
this proximity test and of course you

1061
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:38,880
can try to overcome it from far away by

1062
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,840
using a very strong signal but you know

1063
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:47,220
because signal decays quadratically once

1064
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:50,790
you get 200 meters away there's no

1065
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:53,070
chance that you'll be you'll have enough

1066
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:55,110
power in order to overcome this

1067
00:50:55,110 --> 00:51:00,840
proximity test but s we have yesterday

1068
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,100
in the invited talk by brian sniffing

1069
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,240
implementers will skip all imaginable

1070
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,030
checks and we actually found an amazing

1071
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:12,720
bug it's it may be the first zero day

1072
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,560
bug do I hear anyone wanting to buy zero

1073
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,829
day bugs here

1074
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:23,029
1 million bitcoins Hey

1075
00:51:23,029 --> 00:51:27,829
so what did we do we bought very cheap

1076
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:32,309
thing be a valuation kick it costs a few

1077
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:34,920
dollars and it weights only a few grams

1078
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,940
here you can see somebody holding the

1079
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,210
evaluation kit and this is the computer

1080
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:43,650
science department at the Weizmann

1081
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,900
Institute and we are actually having fun

1082
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:50,009
taking over all the smart lights in the

1083
00:51:50,009 --> 00:51:52,829
computer science building but this was

1084
00:51:52,829 --> 00:51:55,799
not fair enough I wanted they have the

1085
00:51:55,799 --> 00:51:59,069
challenge so we went to one of the most

1086
00:51:59,069 --> 00:52:01,829
famous buildings in Israel this is a

1087
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:03,509
building which has the highest

1088
00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:05,549
concentration of cyber security

1089
00:52:05,549 --> 00:52:08,099
companies in Israel maybe in the world

1090
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:15,869
it has the RSA company the EMC Oracle it

1091
00:52:15,869 --> 00:52:18,150
is really set by the way it's just next

1092
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,549
door they are responsible for

1093
00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:22,499
cybersecurity protecting the whole of

1094
00:52:22,499 --> 00:52:25,529
Israel so what we did was to use a

1095
00:52:25,529 --> 00:52:30,210
quadcopter we tied our attack kit which

1096
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:32,579
weights only a few grams underneath and

1097
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:35,190
we started our attack from 400 meters

1098
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:38,190
away and the next movie we'll show you

1099
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:42,569
what we did so watch carefully as soon

1100
00:52:42,569 --> 00:52:44,160
as you'll see our lights in that

1101
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,299
building starting to flicker it means

1102
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:50,430
that we are taking over all the lights

1103
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:56,598
in that building and let's run the movie

1104
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:06,660
okay so you'll start by having a view of

1105
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,780
the drone on the ground then later on

1106
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,910
we'll switch to the view of the drones

1107
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:14,490
camera we are taking off and we are

1108
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:16,319
hundreds of meters away from that

1109
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,750
building about 400 meters away and

1110
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,849
you'll see that some of the light will

1111
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:22,890
start flickering already we are flying

1112
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:25,520
still silly along the railway line

1113
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,309
approaching this building and the lights

1114
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:33,690
are all obeying our instructions and if

1115
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,089
you will look very carefully those of

1116
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:38,160
you who know Morse code will immediately

1117
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,200
realize that this is we did it better da

1118
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,170
da da da da SOS we are being hijacked

1119
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:45,300
all the lights in that building are

1120
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,190
doing this okay I thought about bringing

1121
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:53,130
the drone here and flying over Santa

1122
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,619
Barbara and I've no idea how many smart

1123
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:57,000
lights Phillip smart lights are

1124
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,210
installed by Santa Barbara residence but

1125
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,670
within a couple of hours I could could

1126
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:04,619
probably disable all of them just by

1127
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,530
flying the drone around we informed

1128
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:10,760
Philips about it and they confirmed that

1129
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,220
the bug is real and they thanked us and

1130
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,750
now they are scratching their heads how

1131
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,569
to fix the problem is this huge number

1132
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:20,579
of installed devices so this is a

1133
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:22,890
warning sign about the security of IOT

1134
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:27,618
devices thank you

1135
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,550
thank you very much so that concludes

1136
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,440
the rump session but I would like to

1137
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,869
take this opportunity to thank various

1138
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:42,840
people so first of all the speakers for

1139
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,300
I think contributing some very excellent

1140
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,450
talks and very funny ones as well

1141
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:52,290
secondly the people at the front and at

1142
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:55,890
the back from the AV systems for their

1143
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:59,520
excellent help with making sure that

1144
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,680
everything went smoothly

1145
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,520
Brian LaMacchia a general chair for

1146
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:09,210
setting out also the extra room and then

1147
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:14,010
Joanne for getting me some tea and I'd

1148
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,900
like to I'd like to thank Martin for

1149
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,760
being such an excellent senior vice

1150
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,740
presidential Olympic rump session

1151
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,590
committee member thank you I'd like to

1152
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:24,780
thank you as well and we'll be looking

1153
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,460
for a new rump session chairs next year

1154
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,930
