donation in his honor to support student

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,560
attendance at the conference and we're

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,640
going to be giving some some remarks in

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,039
his memory

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,160
uh this was a this was a remark uh from

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,640
nishant chadron at microsoft

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,359
nashant kumar was an amazing person

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,439
he was a very creative upcoming

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,719
superstar

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,040
being one of the first research fellows

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,079
on the easy pc team he wrote outstanding

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,120
papers with us co-authoring both crypt

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,559
flow papers

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,200
nishant had really rare technical skills

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,360
spanning across theoretical cryptography

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,600
as well as systems he had a deeper

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,440
connection with microsoft too having

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,079
spent two years in the azure backup team

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,520
before joining us

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,000
he had a real strong drive for research

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,760
which led him to give up that position

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,359
and then join us

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,920
he had this childlike enthusiasm to

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,840
learn everything he could

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,400
but above all nishant was a really warm

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,799
affectionate person with an endearing

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,760
smile

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,680
and anyone who interacted with him will

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,280
vouch for that

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,759
he was extremely caring and considerate

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,439
i fondly recall my everyday

38
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,680
conversations with him on research

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,880
careers life and life in india

40
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,799
he wanted to return to india soon after

41
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,320
his phd

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,240
and along with a

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,880
fellow mayank he truly made the lab and

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,759
team atmosphere exciting and lively his

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,759
passing leaves a large void in the

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,520
cryptography community

47
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,479
the msr family and me personally too so

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,840
we'd like to

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,600

all for some time

75
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,239
nishant was the kind of student that

76
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,360
every advisor wants to have as was also

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,599
read out just now he was

78
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,040
very very honest very highly motivated

79
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,920
full of curiosity always brimming with

80
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,800
life i mean he he was full of questions

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,440
he wanted to talk about everything and

82
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,519
obviously he was very good at science he

83
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,480
was doing extremely well uh in research

84
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,400
all of us know that

85
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,040
what i'd also like to add is that uh you

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,360
know besides these wonderful qualities

87
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,599
of a student and a researcher he was

88
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,599
also

89
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,599
a wonderful

90
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,040
person a wonderful relationship uh

91
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,879
to have so

92
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,920
for instance he did not uh

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,799
just interact with me as as a student it

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,959
was not just you know that he would he

95
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,439
was showing up to to meetings and he was

96
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,439
doing everything he was asked to and so

97
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,200
on but

98
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,680
over and above that he he made the

99
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,560
relationship really warm and personal he

100
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,519
would

101
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,400
you know stay in touch uh

102
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,720
even aft after he

103
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
stopped being my student

104
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,120
he would write me these long emails you

105
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,199
know full of details about what was

106
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,400
going on and often uh asked ask me what

107
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,720
i thought about various things he was

108
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,320
very appreciative of the role that

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
people

110
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
played in his life and

111
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,040
he was really

112
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,440
warm and uh

113
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,720
he made he made the relationship so

114
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
almost like a younger brother you know

115
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,840
so it was really something very special

116
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,120
and uh

117
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,160
it's it was it was the kind of uh

118
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,040
relationship that you know you you

119
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,680
you treasure and you hope for as an

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,720
advisor so i know that there are many

121
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,880
people who want to say things so i won't

122
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,919
uh

123
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,039
hold hold up too much but

124
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,680
his passing was

125
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,240
much more than you know just

126
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,440
the passing of i mean a student is like

127
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,320
a younger sibling and it was really

128
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,840
heartbreaking

129
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,039
but uh

130
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,600
wherever you are now nishant my

131
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,680
friendship and affection are always with

132
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,639
you thank you

133
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,080
was my phd student at uiuc

134
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,600
he was there for about

135
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,440
two years a little less than two years

136
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,240
he was he was my protege he was so hard

137
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,880
working so sincere

138
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,800
so curious

139
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,280
so passionate about cryptography and he

140
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
was ready to take on the world

141
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,800
and as nishant and shweta have already

142
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,759
said he was he was an amazing a dream

143
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,800
student

144
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,479
to have and also just a really great

145
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,440
friend and person to have around and he

146
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,160
livened up the atmosphere all around

147
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,000
and um

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,199
we really miss him um he passed away in

149
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,759
a tragic accident on april 10 earlier

150
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,759
this year

151
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,960
and i

152
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,759
want to say two things about him that i

153
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,360
still think about all the time

154
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,319
one of nishan's beautiful qualities um

155
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,680
that set him apart was how open and

156
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,479
trusting and genuine he was

157
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,720
um all the time

158
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,039
he would often tell us about his family

159
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,039
back in india and how much they meant to

160
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,639
him

161
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,759
he would think about every little

162
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,039
detail very very carefully and this is a

163
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,960
great skill to have of course as a

164
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
graduate student especially helpful when

165
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
you're writing proofs

166
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,120
but he would also think about and want

167
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,599
to talk about every decision in in a lot

168
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,160
of detail and as a result i would end up

169
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,680
talking to him

170
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,120
about research

171
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,080
other decisions and just generally about

172
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,880

176
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,080

177
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,560
so honest so warm um

178
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,120
around all the time and wanting to talk

179
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,000
and

180
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,879
um

181
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,360
and yeah and he was so authentic and so

182
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,240
honest it was very hard not to think of

183
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,759
him as family

184
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,400
and um you know sweater also already

185
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,840
said it it's and it's not just me

186
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,039
um but also other students at uiuc

187
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,400
including amit ruta and sora who are all

188
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,520
here and james who couldn't be here

189
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
you know we all thought of him as family

190
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,240
and we're really devastated at having

191
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,440
lost him

192
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,800
um

193
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
and we still miss him all the time

194
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,360
academically nishant was one of the best

195
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,919
students you can imagine having

196
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,800
both in your classroom and as a phd

197
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,559
advisor

198
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,719
he loved long deep technical

199
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,039
conversations he was happy to keep

200
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,479
talking for

201
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,120
any number of hours on end and nothing

202
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,200
was no number of discussions were ever

203
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,480
too much for him

204
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,279
and

205
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,440
i remember especially after in-person

206
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,120
meetings which became rare because of

207
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,160
kovid um he would often have a visible

208
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,519
smile on his face telling me that hey

209
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,519
