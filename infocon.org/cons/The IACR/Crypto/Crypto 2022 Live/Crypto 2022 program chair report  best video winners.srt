1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,480
let's try this

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,040
okay let's hope uh this works all right

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,600
so this is a program chair report i hope

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,440
everything all right great all right

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,360
let's start with the statistics thank

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,519
you for waiting um

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,759
all right so in and out uh

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,039
we got 452 submissions after a couple of

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,039
um initial withdrawals i believe it's a

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,199
record for crypto

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,519
after early reject round our goal was to

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,320
reject uh early reject roughly speaking

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
half of the submission some of them were

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,840
very good it's just kind of as a

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,600
practical matter that

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,160
it's unlikely they would get in so we

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,399
slightly overachieved it was good so we

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,480
got 212

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,440
papers survived the rejection round and

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,000
then they accepted exactly and even uh

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,600
100 papers

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,559
um

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,719
one paper was a hard marriage three soft

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,879
merges overall there are 96 peaking

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,719
slots which is again a record for crypto

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,280
but slightly down from last year

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,800
but i think the papers are great i hope

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,320
you enjoy the program

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,600
uh we had 71 pc submissions

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,240
19 of them got in so

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,720
slightly higher average than

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,560
general population but i think not all

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,720
trenches within kind of the expectations

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,200
that pc probably submits uh slightly

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,320
higher on average papers uh and we also

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,640
in terms of number of submissions per pc

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,560
on average we get one submission per pc

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,119
member so everything at least according

39
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,479
to statistical uh eye test uh sim kosher

40
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,320
so no corruption sum on pc um so

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,479
this is a little bit let's see this is a

42
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,159
laser point this is a slide there's a

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,000
lot of topics it's hard to read so tom

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,560
asked me to put some kind of joke so i'm

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,040
going to try to put the jokes so while

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,720
you read that as i'm going to single out

47
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,240
two areas uh foundations and theory and

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,159
applied cryptography so those are the

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,000
closes that i could find to the program

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
chairs you can guess which one even

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,399
though i do work in applied crypto but

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,079
i guess it's probably the closest to me

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,600
this is closest to tom so this is

54
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,680
submitted papers

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,200
uh distribution um so usually people try

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,119
to submit to please the chair they hope

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,038
the chairs will push the area so what

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,800
happened in our case

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,760
uh so this is a distribution according

60
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,480
to self-proclaimed areas over here

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,840
um so foundations in theory i did really

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,640
well

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,360
you know so you know thank you guys for

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,599
uh you know whatever you did um so tom

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,480
let's see what thom is so hit it here so

66
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,879
you know we've run this but uh anyway

67
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,080
it's uh

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,400
uh it was all done by the pc but that's

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
my joke um all right so this is uh tom

70
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,760
did this amazing

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,480
uh tom did this amazing word cloud of

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,400
what is important in today's script it's

73
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,959
apparently not cryptocurrency not even

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,720
blockchain but

75
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,599
signature schemes by far proof

76
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,920
zero knowledge functions uh applications

77
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,440
actually becoming important who would

78
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,800
have thought anyway

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,120
so uh

80
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,080
what else uh so this is like the local

81
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,319
heroes villains depending whether you

82
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,920
want to look up to people there's a lot

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,680
of accepted papers so you hate those

84
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,879
people i don't know

85
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,640
which camp you are

86
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,800
so from my perspective

87
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
i really care about integrity of pc so

88
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,280
in terms of pc no pc member got more

89
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
than two papers accepted which i think

90
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
is within kind of expectations so well

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,000
actually maybe slightly below so

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
uh hopefully we didn't have very corrupt

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,440
pc

94
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,319
so if you really want to see what will

95
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,680
help you to get the most papers accepted

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,840
become friends with you well

97
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,560
so that's uh you know

98
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
better indicators than being on our pc

99
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,159
um

100
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,560
anyway so um

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,599
a few other facts pc reviews a lot well

102
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,959
two program co-chairs tom and i um

103
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,120
we had 72 pc members we're really glad

104
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,200
initially we were advised to take few

105
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,680
members we are so glad we took 72

106
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,120
because yeah we got a record number of

107
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,879
submissions um anyway some most of the

108
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,360
people got a standard load so everything

109
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,599
is fine we decided not to do this

110
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,840
highest standard for pc submitted papers

111
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,239
every paper just got three reviews uh

112
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,439
just because we didn't believe there is

113
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,000
any kind of corruption on our system

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,238
just papers will be treated uh fairly

115
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,800
especially with such a huge pc is just

116
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,880
kind of crazy so we did a simple thing i

117
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,120
think it worked out well uh of course

118
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,800
when there are problems we required more

119
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,479
pc uh great thanks uh to we got a lot of

120
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,639
external sub reviewers of course uh they

121
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,199
did a fantastic job um

122
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,600
uh so one innovation i'll talk about

123
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,040
investors later we did allow pc members

124
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,680
to submit up to four papers i was

125
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
you know despite the

126
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,800
advice of the icr guide to chairs but we

127
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,440
felt uh some high quality reviewers

128
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,280
wouldn't accept our

129
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,400
invitation otherwise i'll talk to show

130
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,639
you some statistics in a second

131
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,160
um

132
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,199
so

133
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,120
in indeed especially for students we

134
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,199
felt it was very important

135
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,880
especially for professors and so on not

136
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,720
to block them

137
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,800
when they have papers with students

138
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
so it resulted in basic reviewing load

139
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,639
of 18

140
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,400
but what we did

141
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
i'll discuss at the end whether we i

142
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
think it's a good idea or not but we

143
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
need some kind of penalty for people who

144
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
submit more papers you really should

145
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,080
shouldn't submit like i don't know

146
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,680
papers which you don't think will get in

147
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
but paper which are really important for

148
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,479
students or something so you pay

149
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,400
basically for extra reviewing loads of

150
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,560
every extra paper you save you beyond

151
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,479
the first loose i mean

152
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,160
after the first one you basically have

153
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,400
to cover one paper you know you

154
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,160
basically you get three reviews done for

155
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,240
you so you have to do three reviews for

156
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,400
somebody else it's kind of even steven

157
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,880
um so people complained initially but

158
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,039
kind of worked out so

159
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,160
you know

160
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,240
some more statistics so this is an

161
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,880
interesting one in terms of how many pc

162
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,840
members submitted zero one two three and

163
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,240
four so two is basically the standard

164
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,080
before our experiments three and fours

165
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,240
away a few people over here but there

166
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,639
were 12 pc members those were actually i

167
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,080
don't have statistics for that but those

168
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,639
were very very active pc members who did

169
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,840
a great job so we felt like this

170
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,360
actually experiment paid off we did get

171
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,039
good pc members for us and some good

172
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,080
papers um without uh you know accepting

173
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,919
all necessarily those papers and so on

174
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,479
so uh they overall like the experiment

175
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,720
all right the words in the interest of

176
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,960
time are starting straight over so they

177
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,199
were presented here so of course uh

178
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,479
congratulations to bran david uh ward

179
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,680
katarina errell ellis um of course we

180
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,840
had um really a privilege an honor to

181
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,520
have an amazing invited speaker you

182
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,400
there who give a fantastic talk about

183
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,919
mpc journey

184
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,240
uh something i'll flash it briefly it

185
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,680
may not be have been announced but we

186
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,720
have uh

187
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,479
more than usual but we had a really

188
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,319
strong problem so we'll have six papers

189
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,039
uh invited to journal of cryptology

190
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,440
maybe it's even news to the authors but

191
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,960
so here are the papers i will not read

192
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,680
them

193
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,720
in the interest of time but

194
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,960
congratulations to doctors if you see

195
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,479
your name you will hopefully get an

196
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,199
invitation soon

197
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,599
so this is a papers invited

198
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,919
to journal of cryptology

199
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,520
but it was very hard selection we had

200
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,599
really great papers so i don't want to

201
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,840
spend the rest of this talk about sounds

202
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,199
innovations which

203
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,319
both tom and i feel passionate about

204
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,400
and we would like them to continue so we

205
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,160
tried a lot of uh probably more than

206
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,240
average uh on average new things is

207
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,440
crypto so um in terms of reviewing per

208
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,319
um process our main goal was that each

209
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,240
paper should get constructive objective

210
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,919
feedback

211
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,800
and we all had our share of complaints

212
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,319
about some of the previous editions

213
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,240
where we don't even know if

214
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,800
some reviews were really low quality uh

215
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,120
we had the three battles people didn't

216
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,479
you know so

217
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,160
you know i will not repeat those things

218
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
i wanted to you know tom and i wanted to

219
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,680
make sure that listen our pc will be

220
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,520
different we will really do

221
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
very high quality job and have high

222
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,520
quality reviews but in particular

223
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,800
including

224
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,879
why and how the pc has arrived at its

225
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,720
final except reject decisions so

226
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,879
contrary to kind of so people don't say

227
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,319
us like i don't know maybe you disagree

228
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,639
with us but at least you see our point

229
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,560
we'll tell you how we did it so some

230
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,639
innovations that i will briefly mention

231
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,479
are discussion leaders interactive

232
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,120
discussion with the authors and

233
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,440
some non-three subtle both non-trivial

234
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,599
changes to the review form i'll go

235
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,200
through those things quickly and see how

236
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,760
it works out so in terms of discussion

237
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,279
leaders we

238
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,839
had one discussion leader per papers uh

239
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,839
that that person was responsible

240
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,599
effectively for all aspects of the paper

241
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,680
because we cannot tom and i cannot be

242
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,240
personally responsible for 452 papers

243
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,040
it's just infeasible uh but we felt like

244
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,200
um you know you know the normal

245
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,440
reviewing load i think was six

246
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,839
discussion review load was six so i felt

247
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,760
like it's reasonable for pc member to be

248
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,200
personally responsible for six papers um

249
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,959
and also the job is also including

250
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,800
moderating this interactive discussion

251
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,360
that we'll talk about in a second and

252
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,200
one other important thing to address is

253
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,120
things that people should know that the

254
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,640
paper was read and should understand

255
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,720
what really happened we introduced this

256
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
important field reviewer consensus

257
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,880
summary in the review form it was kindle

258
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,560
the roster until decision but it was

259
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,080
filled only by the discussion leader at

260
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,360
the very end

261
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,920
basically before notifications um

262
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,760
us and out to basically say listen we

263
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,360
read your paper this is roughly speaking

264
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,279
what happened and for most of the papers

265
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,040
you got this form few people didn't feel

266
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
the forum we bugged them repeatedly we

267
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
did our best but i hope you like this

268
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,640
innovation and we got some positive

269
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,160
feedback about it

270
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,839
uh so it worked out overall discussion

271
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,519
leader quite well there were a couple of

272
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,279
discussion leaders unfortunately who

273
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,560
were not up to the task really minority

274
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,880
strict minority by far

275
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,000
so

276
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,880
you know

277
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,959
we did the best we could but

278
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,320
you know that's

279
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,680
what we did

280
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,079
also it was kind of pretty tricky to do

281
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,440
this discussion leader assignments

282
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,279
because of late reviews again it is the

283
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,320
best we

284
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,800
we could and overall i would say it was

285
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,040
a success um so i think it should

286
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,680
continue uh another very important thing

287
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,120
which was the most controversial

288
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,880
probably things that we did is a new

289
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,000
rebuttal thing so i will not go into

290
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,560
details but i am i think both tom also

291
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,959
shares this view uh the old rebata thing

292
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,720
was like basically a complete disaster

293
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,440
it like almost did more harm that helped

294
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,279
it uh

295
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,360
overwhelmed and structured reviews

296
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,440
different reviews emphasizing different

297
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,560
things you had no idea what affects you

298
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,600
know

299
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,959
except reject things you write this uh

300
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,040
really a lot of time on community was

301
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,200
wasted you get emotional you write this

302
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,519
like long google doc so just utter

303
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,920
disaster basically kind of more harm uh

304
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,079
and often it's like you rises three page

305
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,760
three bottle at the end nothing changes

306
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,839
the reviews exactly the same just a

307
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,720
disaster basically so we had to fix it

308
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,040
so our solution was to make it short

309
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,760
focused and matter so the way we did it

310
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,360
and it was also part of the large

311
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,120
interactive discussion so what we did

312
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,519
this uh kind of in the first stage we

313
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,120
our review form

314
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,720
there was only one field that people

315
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,240
could see

316
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,320
after the initial reviews which is the

317
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,760
field i'll show it in a second but this

318
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,279
is a field which is question

319
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,920
clarifications to authors where before

320
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,279
the reviewer to really think saying

321
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,640
listen this is only thing the author

322
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,880
will say please think what is important

323
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
what can change your mind what is really

324
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,320
important for the paper why do you

325
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,000
recommend the paper to be accepted

326
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
rejected

327
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,200
and there are some mandatory things that

328
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,640
you have to put if there is a mistake

329
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,160
don't say there is a mistake and then it

330
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,240
turns out it's not a mistake mistakes

331
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,680
you have to put in so the authors have

332
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,040
to be given a chance to respond to

333
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,200
mistakes weaknesses and security things

334
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,800
oh this is a bogwood thing it's like so

335
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,399
weak and then it's actually not weak

336
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,040
again authors have to be able to respond

337
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
actually there was a lot of work for us

338
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,120
during an interactive discussion later

339
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,639
there was some of those you know

340
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,800
comments by reviewers so saying oh but

341
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,880
this is like weak so we made sure the

342
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,360
authors always saw those things so

343
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,279
that took a lot of our time anything

344
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,639
objective we wanted to make sure the

345
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,480
authors have a chance to respond

346
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
uh logical flaws and things like that

347
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,600
and of course there are logical

348
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,279
questions oh i think i have a simpler

349
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,440
proof uh if you think it really affects

350
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,639
tribulations it's also a very

351
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,160
complicated thing poor that's optional

352
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,839
but you know gives authors to respond

353
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,120
sometimes you're right sometimes you're

354
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,360
wrong but only as i said you really have

355
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
to think typos don't put typos it's kind

356
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,480
of garbage right i mean it's not going

357
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,800
to change except reject things really

358
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
think focus to think and

359
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,839
overall um the so so yeah so anyway this

360
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,279
is like a very long thing that you don't

361
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,519
have to read but we gave very precise

362
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,279
instructions and people biologically

363
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,760
followed it so i i think it was hugely

364
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,959
successful

365
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,639
they think so

366
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,360
uh and then of course we had the usual

367
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,600
rebuttal round which was kind of much

368
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
more you know the initial question you

369
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
know questions were much more condensed

370
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,519
on the full review um and some papers

371
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,120
had zero rounds and people ask us oh why

372
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
didn't we get anything well those papers

373
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,560
at least in our opinion everything was

374
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,800
clear usually you know really bad papers

375
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,639
so the papers which are really good i

376
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,920
don't know maybe they didn't get much

377
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,839
it's just everything was clear listen

378
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,519
you break something on the laptop in

379
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,000
whatever 53 hours you know there is no

380
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,560
questions you know okay you're in it's

381
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,800
fine right so um

382
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,720
for most papers uh you know one round

383
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,560
was enough so it was it was fine it

384
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
maybe didn't result some good things

385
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,880
kind of got answers so whatever um for

386
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,560
some papers we had many more rounds so

387
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,240
there was one famous paper not to be

388
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,680
named it actually was accepted i think

389
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,600
it's a good paper uh but yeah there was

390
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,560
a lot of back and forth uh between but

391
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,760
we got to the proof the paper got

392
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
accepted then i think it's a good result

393
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,199
so we go to the truth one round

394
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,279
definitely wouldn't have been enough for

395
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,440
this paper so hopefully the right things

396
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,519
happen so anyway i'll take a shameless

397
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,000
so i think basically we took it utterly

398
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,680
failed system and turned into something

399
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
successful so i think i strongly

400
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
encourage future chairs including i

401
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,079
guess helena next year to at least

402
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,240
continue a variant of this um so we

403
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,399
really like what we did here uh other

404
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,240
innovations i'll go very quickly so

405
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,720
video abstracts hopefully you um you

406
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,959
know went uh on sunday to some of those

407
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,440
things so if you didn't know uh

408
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,120
a lot of actually very good uh video

409
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,480
upstairs i felt it's actually a good

410
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,720
idea for people who want to get a quick

411
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,639
pitch to decide which talks to attend or

412
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,399
maybe don't want to read the technical

413
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,079
thing to read the video presentation by

414
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,160
authors i think it worked out great

415
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,240
hopefully this condition will continue

416
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,720
so if you haven't seen this please

417
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,399
watch it that's pretty cool

418
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,360
uh

419
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,839
this flexible submission by pc members i

420
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,600
talked about it briefly

421
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,440
uh one thing i mentioned was really

422
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,880
painful to do it with the system

423
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,399
assigning this discussion leaders

424
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,000
changing them especially this wearable

425
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,160
thing was a disaster so it shouldn't be

426
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,000
repeated unless the system

427
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,800
um you know we can help

428
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,880
the reviewing system early rejection

429
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,440
round continuing from fifth of 2001 21

430
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,360
overall it kind of worked i think it was

431
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,519
uh the over half of the paper rejected

432
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,959
overall help with fact focus the

433
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,480
discussion remaining papers we probably

434
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,399
made some mistakes uh

435
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,560
we did the best uh we could hopefully

436
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,440
not too many apologize to people uh who

437
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,199
got maybe a little bit of rushed uh

438
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,199
things but instead experiment hopefully

439
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,360
will be refined um

440
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,760
next year uh so as i said it felt a

441
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,560
little bit rushed but anyway a few very

442
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,839
quick reflections before i conclude

443
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,839
uh things which worked well um focused

444
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,600
rebuttal we're huge fans interactive

445
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,079
discussion it's great that hot crap

446
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,560
supports it so um i think it was very

447
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
very helpful people like that uh

448
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,880
increasing pc submissions limits i i you

449
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,040
know we got a lot of positive feedback

450
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,880
uh the other thing that we did this

451
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,920
variable load and maybe i actually i'm

452
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,000
you know yeah voice should probably be

453
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,199
enough but

454
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,800
i don't see why we need to have them i

455
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,320
think let people just decide if they

456
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,240
want to be on the pc

457
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,759
the community is so huge there are so

458
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,600
many reviewers i mean i understand if

459
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,199
there are like 10 at the early days of

460
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,320
crypto you can say oh it's like

461
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,160
everything is a pst the program will be

462
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,320
corrupted it's just kind of crazy you're

463
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,759
not going to corrupt the program with

464
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,399
like 500 submissions so so i think let's

465
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,800
just eliminate it and not worry about

466
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,639
this variable review discussion load

467
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,800
penalty and so on so this would be our

468
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,160
recommendation

469
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,399
so hot crap i mean it's becoming more

470
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,920
and more popular i think all the future

471
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,600
shares are using it fantastic it has a

472
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,560
lot of cool features so uh tags tags

473
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,320
tags we used them

474
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,639
some pc members complained but then you

475
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,480
got on board and you saw how powerful

476
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,560
they are uh helped us a lot there were

477
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,480
other things which were great

478
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,440
so um for this overall we like it it had

479
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
a bunch of things but overall it's a

480
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,360
very powerful system so thank you tom

481
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,320
for

482
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,279
convincing me to use it uh it's great

483
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,480
things which could be improved very

484
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,399
briefly early jack said we were a little

485
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
bit rushed

486
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,399
partially because the schedule initially

487
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,079
was okay but we didn't count some of the

488
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,560
reviewers would be so late and we didn't

489
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,320
want to start it when so many people

490
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,040
going empty things and then so some who

491
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,880
things got dragged on so then we were a

492
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,639
little bit rushed so

493
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,640
something should be

494
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,480
adjusted and we apologize that some

495
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,359
people of the early jax papers uh you

496
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,119
know got a little bit of a short end of

497
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,439
the stick but uh you know we did what we

498
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,119
could a deeper hierarchy would

499
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,799
definitely work currently we had pc

500
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,599
chair discussion leader so

501
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,000
you know from 452 to one

502
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,520
so maybe it's a little bit of a too

503
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,760
shallow hierarchy so especially if the

504
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,199
discussion leaders were not very

505
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,919
receptive we felt uh overwhelmed we

506
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,480
tried to do literally spend like hours

507
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,160
writing comments and doing discussion

508
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,640
leader jobs asking another pc member so

509
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,799
maybe area shares

510
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,120
maybe some guidance from my cr

511
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,039
would also help here but anyway i'll

512
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,640
finish this is basically the last thing

513
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,160
so

514
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,240
hot crab support for our needs you know

515
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,919
could improve definitely for the final

516
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,080
versions we have some hiccups

517
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,120
but

518
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,960
anyway um

519
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,799
i'll finish with the main lesson this is

520
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,799

534
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,039
networking reception which is going to

535
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,480
be um just on the patio below uh corwin

543
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,760
non-malleability

544
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,960
and our best video award goes to lattice

haven't seen it go check it out this is

547
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,640
