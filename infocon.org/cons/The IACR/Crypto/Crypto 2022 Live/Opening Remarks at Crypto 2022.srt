1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,620
I could hear you

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,660
can you hear me on Zoom

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,080
yes okay

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,059
all right well I hope we just got all

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,219
the technical difficulties out of the

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:15,020
way

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,760
for the rest of the conference all right

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,500
so I will do this quickly so because we

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,779
have a pack schedule

10
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,600
um for those of you on Zoom a few tips

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,460
for making it through uh the pack

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,260
schedule if you have two talks at the

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,119
same time that you want to see I

14
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,920
recommend you use two screens Sports

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,739
Center style uh if you're here in person

16
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,360
and you have two talks the same time you

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,920
want to see I'm afraid you'll just have

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,500
to attend them both in a Quantum state

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,020
uh so best of luck with that lunches are

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,360
also a bit compressed but I encourage

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,579
you to think of it as an improvement in

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,980
shorter aggregate sandwiches

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,079
I do want to be serious for a moment

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,640
though as I know this is the first

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,460
in-person crypto for so many of you who

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,840
have been waiting through the pandemic

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,340
to get to this point and to get the

28
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,739
chance to be together in community and I

29
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,239
know for many of you this is the first

30
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,860
time you're watching from home and not

31
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,380
able to join them to join us so I want

32
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,180
to say just a few short words about this

33
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,159
community that we form together

34
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,260
I was once suggested to me that the

35
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,479
definition of a cryptographer is a

36
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,060
person who designs puzzles and I do

37
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,520
think that's true but it captures more

38
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,460
of the what we do than the why

39
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,740
and I think a cryptographer is a person

40
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,140
who seeks to make more interactions

41
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,100
possible

42
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,860
who makes more Community possible on a

43
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,920
wider variety of terms the work we do is

44
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,140
intended to enable people to communicate

45
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,240
on their own terms and in control of

46
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,799
their own information

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,380
and we're also people who enjoy taking a

48
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,899
complicated mess of things and pulling

49
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,720
it apart until we understand them were

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,240
your enemies of conflation we tease

51
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,220
apart the ability to read messages from

52
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,619
the ability to send them the ability to

53
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,600
compute on data from the ability to read

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,299
that to read it and we do this because

55
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,280
when you take things apart and you put

56
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,799
them back together again you can do so

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,619
in surprising in different ways and so

58
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,258
here we are at hybrid conferences trying

59
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,180
to figure out how to graph back together

60
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,700
the pieces of our community and there

61
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,080
are new things that we now know are

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,020
possible iecr membership has so hard as

63
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,760
we've added remote attendance options

64
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,099
and those who may be less able to travel

65
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,500
due to Geographic Financial Health or

66
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,959
caregiving constraints now have some new

67
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,520
tools for engaging and remaining

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,780
connected to us

69
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,760
and the other communities that I'm a

70
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,260
part of including the finance Community

71
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,480
are getting tired of supporting these

72
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
new options and they are dropping them

73
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,260
they sometimes talk about what's

74
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,360
possible but then they fall back on what

75
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,860
is familiar

76
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,140
and I think it is a gift that we have in

77
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,239
this time here together that we can

78
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,519
Cherish The Familiar that we can eat

79
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:51,900
chocolate strawberries and sip

80
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,940
margaritas and accidentally show up to

81
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,640
the wrong room to give our talks but I

82
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,379
think we are also called upon to imagine

83
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,780
what is possible to keep thinking of

84
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,980
ways that we can make our community

85
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,319
better and ways that we can communicate

86
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,700
better with each other

87
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,739
and what am I trying to tell each other

88
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,860
by being here together in this space and

89
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,659
what are those of you on Zoom trying to

90
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,940
tell Love by tuning in remotely at God

91
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,140
knows what hour

92
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,780
uh to join us here and I think one part

93
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,540
of it is we value this community we

94
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,400
value this connection that we have built

95
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,640
over more than 40 years we are here in

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,739
whatever form because we want to see

97
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,299
that connection grow

98
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,120
and I know there are barriers to this

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,980
I know for those of you who are here

100
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,200
being required to wear masks indoors the

101
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,239
talks can be an annoying symbol of what

102
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,519
we've lost or seen to stand in the way

103
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,640
of what we wish to reclaim but just

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,260
think of it as adding some leakage

105
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,798
resilience

106
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:52,080
because the community that is here with

107
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,140
us physically is worth protecting and

108
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,580
the community that is here with us

109
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,920
virtually is worth supporting

110
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,840
and I'll wrap it up before I get too far

111
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,720
beyond my scope as a general chair

112
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,459
um but I just want to say my job has

113
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,319
failed in comparison to the extreme

114
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,239
effort put forth here by Whitney Morris

115
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,939
and the amazing staff at UCSB and I also

116
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,500
want to thank everyone at the icr

117
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,720
especially Kevin and Kay and Brian and

118
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,298
Douglas for all their efforts in putting

119
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,579
things together and as program chairs

120
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,740
you have any notice and Thomas shrimpton

121
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,479
have put together an incredible program

122
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,300
for you all so many thanks to them as

123
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,919
well as to the program committee who

124
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,860
reviewed over 450 submissions this year

125
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,780
and finally I should mention that the

126
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,940
artwork that's up here on the screen as

127
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,220
well as on your t-shirts was made by

128
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,040
Ellen colesnikova black lesnikov's

129
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,060
daughter

130
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,639
and I think it's a fitting symbol of a

131
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,160
blend of crypto tradition alongside the

132
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,139
welcoming and nurturing of new talent

133
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,500
and so please enjoy the conference

134
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,479
and uh we'll get started with Session

135
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,258
One in just a minute
