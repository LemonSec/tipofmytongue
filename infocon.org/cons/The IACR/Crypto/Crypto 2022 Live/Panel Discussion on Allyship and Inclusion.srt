good just yeah simulate that in your

14
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,320
head as we do in this community um

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,560
[Music]

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,119
one thing i wanted to mention is um feel

17
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,560
free to

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,680
feel free to get up and move a little

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,439
bit closer it'd be great if this is kind

20
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,360
of an open discussion we have like

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,600
great experts here with uh with with

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,000
great ideas uh but uh

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,280
everyone else in the community probably

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,640
has some really good ideas too it'd be

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,320
nice if this is like an open discussion

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,000
i really have no idea how to structure

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,680
this uh but we're all like adults and uh

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,119
we want to we want to hear from you if

29
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,560
you have something you feel like you can

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,920
add and then that's great we have a

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
microphone up here and feel free to come

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,920
up at any time everyone on the panel is

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,880
okay with

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
being interrupted at any time within

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,799
reason

36
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,520
good

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,320
so

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
as i was saying i sort of interpreted

39
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,320
the call for this panel to be like who's

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,200
being

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,560
who's being kind of left out of our

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,960
community and uh either actively or

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,600
passively and hey how could we like not

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,880
do so much of that

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,560
that's kind of my understanding of what

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,880
we can talk about today

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,360
i sort of had a few goals

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,200
that maybe we can all come away with

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,878
ideas of things that we can do those of

50
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,639
us who are kind of interested in in

51
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,160
being allies and kind of don't know what

52
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,280
that looks like

53
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,200
could come up with some concrete goals

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,360
on an individual level and maybe also

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,080
discuss uh things that could be done

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
at the level of the community maybe have

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,599
some ideas that could percolate up

58
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,360
through the iacr leadership maybe who

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,560
knows

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,319
um

61
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,440
good i think that's what i wanted to say

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,640
i hope you'll forgive me for having

63
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
notes because i want to be

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,040
precise about my language

65
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,840
good

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,280
so as an icebreaker i thought we could

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,720
start off by

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,160
asking each panelist to sort of share

69
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,840
an example of some allyship that they've

70
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,440
experienced in their careers

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,040
either a positive or negative one but

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,360
maybe a positive one will maybe inspire

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,319
some

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,080
some similar actions by the audience

75
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,920
members maybe we can start with with

76
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,680
anna who we're trying to

77
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,760
we're trying to preserve

78
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,120
the amount of speaking voice you have

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,480
right right so um i have laryngitis so

80
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
yes

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,080
so um

82
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,400
i want to you know talk kind of from my

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,239
own perspective with somebody who has

84
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,560
benefited a lot from allership

85
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,120
what it takes for somebody to be an ally

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
to me so this is personal

87
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,840
um and so i distilled it into three

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,280
rules

89
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,040
number one

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,560
show up

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,519
and

92
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,040
i don't i'm not going to comment on you

93
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,560
know

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,480
you'll know what showing up means it

95
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,560
sounds easy but it's not especially when

96
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,879
there's nothing in it for you so show up

97
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,640
as rule number one

98
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,599
um

99
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,400
rule number two is

100
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,200
lead by example like model the behavior

101
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,080
that you think is necessary

102
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
um

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,000
don't necessarily even talk about it but

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,760
just model it

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,159
and uh rule number three is be positive

106
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,959
so

107
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,720
um i'm going to illustrate rule number

108
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,439
two and rule number three with

109
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,959
personal stories

110
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,920
so rule number two lead by example

111
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,519
um so i want to call out two allies who

112
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,160
have led by example in my opinion

113
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,720
and have proved to be allies

114
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,840
and uh the first example is leo raisin

115
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,680
and there are very many instances where

116
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
you spin an ally by leading by example

117
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,160
but i'm just gonna tell you about one

118
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
um so when we were in graduate school

119
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,040
together

120
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,199
uh leah became a parent for the first

121
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,560
time

122
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,400
and uh

123
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,639
and it was very visible

124
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,600
so

125
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
he he brought his son with him to

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,639
various events he talked about him he

127
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,560
made sure that he wasn't working you

128
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,759
know

129
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,800
like

130
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,160
more than a certain number of hours a

131
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
week so that he could

132
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,720
um give his wife some breathing room

133
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,320
and i didn't know at the time that that

134
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,800
was allyship but it really is

135
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,360
and this is this is a behavior where he

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,000
is an ally not to me personally

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,360
but he's an ally to gender equality

138
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,400
so

139
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,120
thanks leo i'm not sure he's watching

140
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,960
this on zoom but

141
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,880
he's the la number one that i wanted to

142
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,280
mention and i also wanted to mention

143
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,080
another ally claudio orlandi again he

144
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,800
was an la to me personally

145
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,600
but when his wife got pregnant

146
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,720
he missed

147
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
a workshop that i think was important to

148
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,560
him because he really wanted to go to it

149
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,479
because he wanted to be with her

150
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,360
and to support her through this journey

151
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,560
so again leading by example

152
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,160
and it's not like he talked about how

153
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,880
he's a feminist he just acted as a

154
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,199
feminist so that's what i mean like um

155
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,960
lead by example

156
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,560
and then in terms of be positive i'm

157
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,680
going to tell you

158
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,440
another story which i think is somewhat

159
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,639
negative

160
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,120
um so i said a b positive song okay um

161
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,319
so um this was a few years ago

162
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,600
and i work at brown and we had a

163
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,520
discussion with undergraduate students

164
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,919
about applying to graduate schools

165
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,880
and

166
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,080
there were two of us leading the

167
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,520
discussion was me and a faculty member

168
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,880
in biology

169
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,440
and he was he is wonderful and he was

170
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,080
very eager to speak and share his ideas

171
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
so in fact he was so eager that he kept

172
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,160
interrupting me

173
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,240
and i don't mind it at all i mean i also

174
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,080
interrupted him i didn't feel there's

175
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,600
anything wrong

176
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,440
then

177
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,680
a little bit after the discussion the

178
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,280
students complained to the

179
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
administration about how the discussion

180
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,919
was gendered and called him out on his

181
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,639
male dominant behavior

182
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,840
and

183
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,319
that i think is a negative example

184
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,360
because

185
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,960
they didn't give him the benefit of the

186
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,840
doubt

187
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,680
they got him you know

188
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,440
real in real trouble for nothing because

189
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,440
i totally didn't feel like he was

190
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,800
interrupting me more than i was

191
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,319
interrupting him

192
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,880
so i don't think that that behavior is

193
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,479
helpful

194
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,800
even if they you know inside maybe they

195
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,880
thought he's not modeling good behavior

196
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,400
i think

197
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,039
i think um

198
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,880
calling him out like this was not

199
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,840
helpful

200
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,319
so that's why my third rule is be

201
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,960
positive tell people what you like about

202
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
their behavior as opposed to what you

203
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,680
don't like

204
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,720
so that's it

205
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,039
thank you

206
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,160
oh me next okay

207
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,440
then i think i'll hear something

208
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,880
personal

209
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,240
hopefully positive

210
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,160
about seven years ago when i was in my

211
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,639
first year phd i encountered this one

212
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,879
paper that i think it's great but is

213
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,400
discussing a new topic for me that i

214
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,599
don't understand

215
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,720
and i was

216
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,039
pairing my linear pairings you know

217
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,160
first time you see them you split a

218
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,280
little bit it takes a while to

219
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,599
understand and i had nobody that could

220
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,479
guide me that so i gathered strength and

221
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,319
wrote to one of the authors of the paper

222
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,919
who is a you know well-established

223
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,840
cryptographer dario fiora

224
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,759
me and the master student that was

225
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,599
working with me back then

226
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,560
and he was just so kind within one day

227
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
or two he replied to the email with you

228
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,400
know this is a literature you can read

229
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,919
these are the answers to your questions

230
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,599
these are the trick in my paper that you

231
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,960
didn't understand

232
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,000
and that

233
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,840
helped me so much it was a knowledge i

234
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,160
couldn't have gotten otherwise i mean

235
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,759
you have everything at the finger at

236
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,680
your fingertips on the internet but it's

237
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,599
hard to find the right thing if you

238
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,360
don't know what to search for in the

239
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,039
beginning of your career

240
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,519
and what is very successful is that that

241
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,919
research paper turned out sorry that

242
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,200
mock statistics turned out to be a

243
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,279
research paper and dario fury became

244
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,519
also my co-adviser and his

245
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,920
uh my personal role model

246
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,839
for how he is and whenever i feel sad

247
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,320
about bad things do happen i think of

248
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,760
him and it's like okay

249
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,839
there are good people around and if

250
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,600
there is this example i can also be one

251
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,080
of these good people and we can slowly

252
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,920
turn things to the shiny side

253
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,760
that sounds great i think

254
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,880
first of all

255
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,959
i'm very happy to be here with everyone

256
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,720
i i guess we have much more people than

257
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,200
i expected i'm very happy to see that

258
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
so so i want to share

259
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,200
a positive story but also a negative one

260
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
so that we see both sides of the coin

261
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,480
like what is good to do and what's not

262
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,640
good to do so i'm from colombia south

263
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,120
america and typically from these

264
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
underrepresented regions if you make it

265
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,880
to these places

266
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
is either because of one or two things

267
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
or

268
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
a perhaps three things

269
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,720
so either your university or your region

270
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,160
had someone who went out

271
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,600
years ago

272
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,440
build a career and return and help you

273
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,640
or

274
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,680
either

275
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,560
someone from abroad a

276
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,399
somehow was involved in in your

277
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,920
community in your region and help you as

278
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,880
well

279
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,200
or alternatively which we also see this

280
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,800
happen well you had opportunities that

281
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,240
perhaps other didn't you could afford

282
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,000
to pay a phd or something similar but

283
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,079
that's not rare but

284
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,519
in my case

285
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,360
the community we had in our city was

286
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,519
relatively small and i want to share the

287
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,600
story of someone who

288
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,120
helped me

289
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,560
achieve my goals

290
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,360
trying to get a phd and something along

291
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,040
those lines

292
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,519
this person is called puja farshin and

293
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,519
ashland connolly as well so they too

294
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,240
attended uh an event

295
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,040
in

296
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,120
in colombia so they attended an event in

297
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,600
bogota which was a summer school a very

298
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,200
small summer school that i'm sure nobody

299
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,120
of you have heard of it it's called

300
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,320
cryptoceo

301
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,959
and for us at least for my supervisor

302
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,320
there like for the people involved it

303
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,720
was a big event it's like it took so

304
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,360
much logistics to put it together and

305
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,040
so much

306
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,279
effort dealing with the bureaucracy with

307
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,040
the different universities and systems

308
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,440
that are relatively outdated and hard to

309
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,480
deal with

310
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,560
and this event got put together and like

311
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,640
they got a series of speakers from

312
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,760
abroad

313
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,160
and and that was amazing and as an

314
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,519
undergrad but then it was for me very

315
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,519
amazing to be even i had to travel from

316
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,680
one city to another and i think this was

317
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,600
my first flight my first time on a plane

318
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,839
and like i'm traveling to a conference

319
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,200
like a small conference in just another

320
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,519
city like 45 minutes away

321
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,120
so i go to this city

322
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,640
and attend the event

323
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,040
and ask questions and i and i

324
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,360
like what's going on and during a coffee

325
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,200
break i meet with this person with pujam

326
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,079
and he sits down with me

327
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,600
he asks me what do you want to do

328
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,200
afterwards and i say like i don't know i

329
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,880
mean i don't feel confident i just have

330
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,720
an undergrad by the way undergrads in

331
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,399
columbia take five years and we have to

332
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,000
write almost like a thesis but like i

333
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,680
just have an undergrad

334
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,120
and

335
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,480
i was like

336
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,600
thinking very

337
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,519
low of myself and he was cheering me up

338
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,200
like no look you are asking very valid

339
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,160
questions you have a very good

340
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,560
background you should apply to this and

341
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,920
this and this and this and this and this

342
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,839
and these places and i still have the

343
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,920
piece of paper where he wrote all this

344
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,680
you can read this and this and this and

345
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,360
this and these books you can contact

346
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,800
these and this and this and these people

347
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
these are the topics that are good for

348
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,079
you to check out these are like he gave

349
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,440
me a super

350
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
a comprehensive list of things

351
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,320
and

352
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,680
that's the first time i learned that

353
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,440
there is a thing called icr for example

354
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,639
or that there's a thing called crypto or

355
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,880
eurocrypt racial crypto latin crypt for

356
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
the matter and many many things and then

357
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,279
i learned about all this i go to the icr

358
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,760
website jobs option and then i see that

359
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,680
there some of the options he listed are

360
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,639
there

361
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,600
and

362
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,680
well i get to apply and he helps me with

363
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,160
that recommendation and that essentially

364
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,279
i think it

365
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,519
helped my application go through and it

366
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,880
turned out to be a great experience i'm

367
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,560
very happy i think the phd went

368
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,240
successful and like it's so it's all

369
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,000
good and i'm very happy that this

370
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,519
happens and it couldn't have happened if

371
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,519
this person and this group of people

372
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,440
wouldn't have attended there and be

373
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
there for us it's a small conferences i

374
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,279
don't think they get any any recognition

375
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,240
for these type of things in the

376
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,959
community and it has so much value not

377
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,560
only because of how they helped me but

378
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,680
also because of the people i have

379
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,440
managed to help afterwards so it's like

380
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,200
it's a whole chain

381
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,440
so that was the good story

382
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,760
and just for the negative one

383
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,360
sorry maybe i should have started your

384
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,480
way around

385
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,680
so for the negative one it's actually

386
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,399
the same event so it was a conference

387
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,320
in in bogota colombia

388
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,519
and

389
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,120
it was very depressing sometimes because

390
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,200
you could hear some of the international

391
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,120
audience making very inappropriate

392
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,440
comments of the facilities or of the

393
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,320
city

394
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,920
or of the quality of the talks that

395
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,079
students were giving or things like that

396
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,920
and sometimes i don't even think you

397
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,440
don't speak english or well but like

398
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,560
you're next to them they're talking

399
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,680
literally

400
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,839
super bad things about the like look the

401
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,360
bathrooms are like oh they talk a lot

402
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,480
all these things

403
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,800
this is this is this is not good so i

404
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,160
think it's pretty good to understand

405
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,320
that not everything or not everyone are

406
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,279
the same

407
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,959
to understand

408
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,199
historical circumstances why things are

409
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,800
one way or another and like not

410
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
criticized from a point of view that

411
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
perhaps may harm

412
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
the others in a way that you perhaps you

413
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,160
don't even know

414
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,399
but it was a minor thing

415
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,279
but that was it yeah

416
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,880
thank you thank you for all of these

417
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,800
stories this is

418
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,480
yeah so i'm going to share a positive

419
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,199
story that that actually impacted all of

420
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,519
my career

421
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,320
and so i'm i'm from north africa and

422
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,880
specifically from from morocco

423
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,720
and

424
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,360
i was lucky to to go to preparatory

425
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,959
classes and to go to an engineering

426
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,880
school to move to france

427
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,839
um

428
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,959
and uh so i decided to start a phd and i

429
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,639
wasn't in the crypto community at all so

430
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,440
i was just interested in doing crypto

431
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,639
and

432
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,560
i i travel like in france like it's easy

433
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,040
to get funding unfortunately like so it

434
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,240
was so i traveled to to financial crypto

435
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,120
um

436
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,519
to i think present a poster

437
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,440
so i was like really outside from you

438
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,680
know from the crypto community

439
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,880
and uh

440
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
and something that really

441
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,199
strikes me still now is that like this

442
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,800
is really like maybe like some people

443
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,160
they don't really think about it when

444
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,519
they ask but the first question that

445
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,199
maybe like most of the senior people

446
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,760
they ask students is who's your advisor

447
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,079
and who are you who are you working with

448
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,600
and once they hear

449
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,680
a name that they don't recognize or

450
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,199
somebody like you know that they don't

451
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,160
know

452
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,639
like you can see clearly like that the

453
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,399
the the conversation is is different

454
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,839
but one person

455
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,600
actually was completely different and

456
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,680
he's actually in the in the room cine

457
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,720
camara

458
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,000
and um he was completely the opposite um

459
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,839
and

460
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,440
um and i remember i was presenting

461
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,040
something on cryptid search

462
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,920
and uh the amount of interest that he

463
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,079
showed to i mean i was just finishing my

464
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,160
undergrad starting my phd

465
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,399
and the amount of interest was just

466
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,040
striking just striking to me like it's

467
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,480
it's something that

468
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,880
um for a student it matters a lot like

469
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,360
for somebody like me like just starting

470
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,959
seeing somebody who's really senior in

471
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,959
the area like and somebody i was seeing

472
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,720
back in there and back then that's

473
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,639
somebody who who's really pioneer in the

474
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,959
area of encrypted search listening

475
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,480
to a student

476
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,519
uh with no publications nothing

477
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,839
um you know and not only that like i

478
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,279
remember very well because like it's

479
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,519
something that's really i keep very dear

480
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,839
to to myself and in my memories is that

481
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,160
like he asked me to send him my papers

482
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,440
to read them

483
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,639
and

484
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,560
you know like you know the the the

485
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,519
modesty and like for some person to to

486
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,759
ask you this like i mean i was like

487
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,040
really like in my undergrad like you

488
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
know i remember and it excites me to

489
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,639
start working on encrypted search and

490
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,000
since then like you know we started a

491
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,880
collaboration and and you know and he

492
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,120
played a significant role for example

493
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,240
like you know i remember in 2014 like

494
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
there was an invitation only workshop

495
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,759
and he was sending an email to the

496
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,120
organizer i don't know there is a

497
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,959
student like you should you should you

498
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,440
should invite him and you know and

499
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,639
they will listen to him because he's

500
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,959
senior so and this is how he played a

501
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,640
significant role at very early in my

502
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,000
career

503
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,559
to actually actually access

504
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,919
uh

505
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,079
you know a kind of very you know small

506
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,559
community that without these kind of

507
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,799
like helps it's very very hard

508
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,439
um yeah so yeah so thank you yeah thanks

509
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,559
yeah thanks everyone for sharing those

510
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,359
uh those personal stories um so before

511
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,840
the before this panel like

512
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
all of us uh on an email discussion had

513
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,760
like brainstormed you know many topics

514
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,320
to talk about um i'm afraid like i'm

515
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,400
really worried that we probably won't

516
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,760
even be able to scratch the surface we

517
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,039
have a lot of interesting things to

518
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,080
discuss

519
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,240
but i wanted to start off by um

520
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,520
by mentioning that

521
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,679
there have been some uh like affinity

522
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,039
events within our community like for

523
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,840
women in cryptography and previous uh i

524
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,200
think in previous cryptos maybe there

525
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,720
have been like a queer crypts meetup um

526
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,120
and i'm wondering if uh

527
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,360
if if anyone on the panel has any

528
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,880
reflections from things that were

529
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,559
learned maybe things that can be

530
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,320
reported back to those of us who are

531
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,080
like interested in in supporting these

532
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,320
communities um and also from anyone in

533
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,720
the audience who has some uh

534
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,320
some feedback for

535
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,480
for anyone who wants to be an ally to

536
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,960
these groups

537
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,360
well i guess i can take that one

538
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,120
and of course feedback from the audience

539
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,280
is welcome any kind

540
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,679
so um

541
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,000
i haven't attended that many queer uh

542
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,039
crypto events but uh after eurogrip this

543
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,039
year uh i was there with chris pruska

544
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,720
and we were like okay there is nothing

545
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,799
for you know queer crypt and so just

546
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,640
sitting on the sofa we was like okay why

547
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,880
don't we organize something how hard can

548
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,160
it be and it took us 15 minutes to drop

549
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,480
some nice flyers and find a way to print

550
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,160
them and then hang them in the bathrooms

551
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,679
because we thought that was the way you

552
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,440
could be more private if you don't want

553
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,679
other people to know about these things

554
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,760
of yours and it turned out to be a great

555
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,799
success

556
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,120
we had a dozen people showing up most of

557
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,880
them young and you know new people in

558
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,160
the community

559
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,280
and

560
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,799
after the first five minutes of

561
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,799
introducing names you know who you are

562
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,080
what are you studying where you come

563
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,960
from

564
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,559
it was exactly the same kind of

565
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,640
discussion as you have out there

566
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,799
everybody was talking about crypto

567
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,480
and say oh you should read this paper oh

568
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,640
but do you know about that result so i

569
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,679
think it's just great and it's how same

570
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,280
the same way as somebody can connect

571
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,200
with people from their own university or

572
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,039
people from the same nationalities or

573
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,960
people that speak the same language as

574
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,400
you that's just a different kind of

575
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,559
community and having it it makes you

576
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,200
feel you belong to yet another bubble

577
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,280
which is so good when you feel isolated

578
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,880
and alone or maybe somebody pulls your

579
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,160
leg and then it's like okay you know i

580
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,840
have a lies i have somebody that just

581
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,679
shares something with me even if you

582
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,760
know we just talk about crypto

583
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,600
so that was a very great experience and

584
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,559
i think the lesson to learn here is

585
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,400
lead by example you want something to

586
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,240
happen make it happen it's not that hard

587
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,159
i understand it is hard to do alone but

588
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,000
just find a body and then in two people

589
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,559
you can go a long shot with your 15

590
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,760
minutes work

591
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,159
and change somebody's life because they

592
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,679
got a new body that they can do research

593
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,400
with they wouldn't have met otherwise

594
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,240
and this can be done for queer crypt but

595
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,480
can be done for many other initiatives

596
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,400
not just at conferences but also within

597
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,280
your own institution

598
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,760
great thanks

599
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,360
you're also loud club

600
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,840
if you want to

601
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,919
just scanning the audience in case

602
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,440
anyone

603
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,159
wants to join in don't be shy we're all

604
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,559
friendly

605
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,720
there is a microphone

606
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,600
i hope this is

607
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,919
not a too problematic question but i

608
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,679
remember our discussion with some of my

609
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,679
colleagues one year ago when we were

610
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,159
talking about this kind of event for

611
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,480
queer people or for women or for

612
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,840
minorities

613
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,440
things like that

614
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,039
and thank you

615
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,520
and um

616
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,679
i remember one of the comments of my

617
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,919
colleagues that said oh but it's

618
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,080
something that's made for for example

619
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,520
minorities so

620
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,360
uh you know

621
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,240
it's not uh it's i mean the papers that

622
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,799
are uh chosen are not legit enough

623
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,480
because of that which is a garbage

624
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,080
comment i agree but

625
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,400
how can we avoid this kind of stuff for

626
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
this kind of event in your opinion

627
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,039
because i that's a criticism that's

628
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,559
um that

629
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,440
comes and comes again a lot i think

630
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,039
okay so do you understand correctly what

631
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,400
you're saying is like people that don't

632
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,559
belong to this description feel like

633
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,200
okay i cannot attend this event

634
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,039
no then i don't hear there's this

635
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,039
problem but also the results of these

636
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,799
events are discarded because they are

637
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,960
kind of reserved

638
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,600
uh often as reserved to

639
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,680
uh queer or women or minorities and

640
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,760
[Music]

641
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,799
i mean

642
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,200
i i have heard some criticism because of

643
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,600
that so i was wondering if you had ideas

644
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,520
to solve this problem

645
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,280
okay so like

646
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,880
the way we did like we also had some

647
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,159
people that say i don't belong to this

648
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,919
bubble but i'm supportive and then we're

649
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,919
open to that so then you know you don't

650
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:20,960
only have

651
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,440
people that could feel labeled by

652
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,120
something but in general i think it's

653
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,760
just a stigma that it's not there and

654
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,600
somebody brings it up it's like okay

655
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,120
then you're part of another bubble like

656
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,480
it's not that you know this is the green

657
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,520
eyes people like uh it's i think like

658
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,760
just don't discriminate others

659
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,600
when you create something and people

660
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,120
that say oh but this is only uneven for

661
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,440
that it's just bad because only like no

662
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,600
but i can understand in some cultures

663
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,440
and in some country it's hard to maybe

664
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,679
come out as gay and you don't want to

665
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,880
people to know that you don't want

666
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,640
people to label like that or to you know

667
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,559
point a finger but

668
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,360
i hope the iacr community can do better

669
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,320
than that

670
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,240
so that this could be a safe place where

671
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,280
you can belong to whatever sub community

672
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,080
you feel you do belong

673
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,480
to but i can also take long discussions

674
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,880
afterwards

675
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
uh thanks for that question um i wanted

676
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,120
to talk a little bit about icr

677
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,080
conferences kind of in general um

678
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,400
since 2018 as far as i could tell we've

679
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,720
had a code of conduct at the icr

680
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,039
conferences

681
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,480
and i'm kind of curious to know

682
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
whether that has changed anything has it

683
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,840
been successful has it accomplished

684
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,120
anything is it just a security theater

685
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,440
or conduct theater

686
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,039
is there anything that that should be

687
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,960
revisited

688
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,640
from the code of conduct

689
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,000
any

690
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,600
if there's any comments on that

691
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,679
i mean in in general i think i i don't

692
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,080
have a lot of experience on the ircr

693
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,440
conference in general but like

694
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,799
fortunately i think the community has

695
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,279
been very supportive and i personally in

696
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,080
the

697
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,320
sort of group i belong to never been

698
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,760
criticized for this um

699
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,799
but

700
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,919
i think this is just because the the

701
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,400
group for instance i belong to

702
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,279
i think

703
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,440
people in general agree that that that

704
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,880
something should be done right like

705
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,400
people in general like like like oh

706
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,760
interesting to know that you're going

707
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,880
through this

708
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,320
and

709
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,919
we didn't know and we want to support

710
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,120
you and like this is in general the

711
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,720
feeling i've get

712
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,880
but i'm aware that that's not the case

713
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,919
with all

714
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,679
communities and all the

715
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,440
particular groups that we have in our

716
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
community like there are problems

717
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,320
that perhaps the community is more a

718
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
reaction likely less less willing to

719
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,600
accept that there is a problem in

720
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,679
certain settings

721
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,159
i fortunately have never been a well a

722
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,080
victim of that so to speak but i wanted

723
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,919
to hear i would like to hear if someone

724
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,640
else maybe has

725
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,720
good time good time to mention

726
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,080
that um the the icr has um

727
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,200
indeed has the code of conduct policy

728
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,559
and um

729
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,640
i mean i think it's a little bit of an

730
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,960
on account it's just like this is what

731
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,919
we expect the kind of behavior we expect

732
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,799
um enforcing it of course is another

733
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,000
question because we don't go and police

734
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,080
the attendees we don't really know what

735
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,360
people are doing

736
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,159
so this is more like you know but laying

737
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,120
out the expectations of behavior

738
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,960
is better than doing nothing so that's

739
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,760
that's kind of a baseline

740
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,440
um and then we also have the iacr

741
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,159
ethics committee which is a

742
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,799
form which was appointed by the ico

743
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,320
board of directors

744
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,840
and i'm actually serving on the ethics

745
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,880
committee

746
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
um and when

747
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,200
when there's an ethical issue that

748
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,240
our members feel requires um

749
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,120
some kind of a grown-up intervention um

750
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,600
sometimes we we hear from members of the

751
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,919
community about these issues

752
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,600
um

753
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,720
the majority of issues actually uh

754
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,480
issues of academic

755
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,520
ethics

756
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,480
you know

757
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,919
plagiarism

758
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,600
things like that

759
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,000
a small number of them

760
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,840
may be regarding the code of conduct

761
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,360
so we haven't fielded a whole lot of

762
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,600
complaints about

763
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
about

764
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,799
icr members

765
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,960
behaving inappropriately which i think

766
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,120
is a reflection of the fact that this is

767
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,360
actually a very healthy community

768
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,080
with responsible adults um so we're

769
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,919
lucky

770
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,000
i hope that answers your question

771
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,240
yeah that's fine yeah michelle go ahead

772
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,760
so uh actually right now the code

773
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,679
right now the code of conduct uh one of

774
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,760
the issues that we have is that it tends

775
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,279
to be associated just with the

776
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,640
conference

777
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,760
and uh

778
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,919
for instance in problems can happen

779
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,159
outside conferences in our field and i

780
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,840
think we need to address that that's

781
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,320
actually one of the points that tao

782
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,399
rabbin is actually

783
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,720
we have to work on because i think we

784
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,640
have to make this more

785
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,840
wide within the i mean like it has to be

786
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,000
something central to the acr so that

787
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,679
people have us a way to contact us

788
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,679
even outside when the problem doesn't

789
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,600
happen within a conference but i think

790
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,279
it's a problem that

791
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,440
unfortunately does happen i personally

792
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,799
don't know

793
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,520
the cases like these are

794
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,919
some of this information is private so

795
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,440
but uh

796
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,080
it has happened and problems with uh

797
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,120
within

798
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,559
a conference

799
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,679
of harassment and things like that so

800
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,760
we would like to think that it's not

801
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,120
something that would happen but it

802
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,080
unfortunately does

803
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,480
i think

804
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,120
i should also i should also mention that

805
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,679
dal is a hero for taking this on because

806
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,919
it's a it's this isn't something she

807
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,080
does she's not on the ethics committee

808
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,919
she's more kind of an ombuds person that

809
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,919
people can come to

810
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,679
if they have issues and they don't know

811
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,000
what to do and she did you know and then

812
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,960
they

813
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,559
sometimes they bring the issues to us in

814
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,080
the ethics committee and sometimes tal

815
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,000
just gives them good advice and

816
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,240
that suffices so i think we should all

817
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,559
you know thank her for doing this very

818
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,559
big very and pretty thankless task

819
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,240
and thank you michelle for sharing and i

820
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,679
think like maybe we don't need to know

821
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,679
the specific of what happened and who

822
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,279
was involved but it's nice to have some

823
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,039
sort of statistics so that we're

824
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,159
actually more aware of these things

825
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,520
i never experienced anything myself

826
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,039
within this community i experienced a

827
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,840
lot in workplaces or around the world

828
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,039
went on visit for research studies but

829
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,279
never at the conference but so it's like

830
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,279
i always perceive this as a very open

831
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,960
and welcoming community from that

832
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,679
perspective of you know physical safety

833
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,480
uh

834
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,320
but it's good to know that you know

835
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,639
there are counter examples

836
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,360
um yeah i generally agree that we are

837
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,279
healthy community but

838
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,880
i think within the last weeks and

839
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,600
especially in the post quantum area we

840
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,919
have seen within the last weeks a couple

841
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,640
of things that i think or a couple of

842
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,760
examples of behavior and communication

843
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,720
that

844
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
shouldn't probably take place and i

845
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,640
think it's great that we discuss this

846
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,960
today but maybe

847
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,720
like discussing the way we are

848
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,799
communicating independent of having

849
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,039
policies and all these things like this

850
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,760
is a great event here for uh inclusion

851
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,600
and all these things um but i think like

852
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
maybe communication is more basic and

853
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,120
also maybe we should at some point

854
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,559
discuss this and uh how we want to like

855
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,960
like be behave based on that or how we

856
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,919
want to change such behavior all both on

857
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,480
the internet maybe like on twitter for

858
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,600
example

859
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,679
where we have seen these things very

860
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,919
recently and i don't know i think

861
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,200
this is

862
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,880
although in general we are a healthy

863
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,559
community i think this is not very

864
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,960
healthy

865
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,159
yeah agreed i'm not on twitter so i

866
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,840
don't read all of that but i heard the

867
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,678
rumors despite not being on twitter

868
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,200
yeah

869
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,760
thanks for that remark um i i had a

870
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,679
chance to talk to someone uh earlier

871
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,600
this week who is a former general chair

872
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,559
of the

873
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,080
of an iacr conference and asked them

874
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,559
about the the code of conduct and and

875
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,159
they reported that

876
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,520
um

877
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,880
it was actually helpful to have a code

878
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,799
of conduct when you had to have that

879
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,039
discussion with someone who needed to be

880
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,559
uh kept in check

881
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,440
like

882
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,000
you know i it's it's not just the

883
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,399
general chair being a capricious uh

884
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,840
arbitrary person but we have a code of

885
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,200
conduct and if you don't shape up we're

886
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,799
gonna kick you out of the conference uh

887
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,320
that conversation was made much easier

888
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,240
by the code of conduct so that's uh

889
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,559
maybe one data point in in favor of the

890
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,519
code of product as well

891
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,840
so on the on the topic of general chairs

892
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,240
uh as we're still talking about uh iacr

893
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,080
conferences is there any

894
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,679
any message you would want to give to

895
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,519
future general chairs who are organizing

896
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,279
events like there's something that you

897
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,080
wish

898
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,679
that someone would be brave enough to

899
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:24,559
try

900
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,159
or something you think they should they

901
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,840
could do

902
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,440
to make this a a more inclusive event

903
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,640
i can i can say a couple of ideas that i

904
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,840
think

905
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,360
would be really helpful for at least

906
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,679
some some countries and this brings me

907
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,440
to the topic of uh

908
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,559
of

909
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,919
of the timing

910
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,480
of the of the crypto conference so if

911
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,760
you notice like for example the

912
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,720
acceptance date it's around april may

913
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,039
kind of like you know these these months

914
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,360
and then the conference is in august

915
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,720
so

916
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,880
so for some authors who are from

917
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,039
different locations who require visa

918
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,880
three months is not enough

919
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
three months isn't if even if you up you

920
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,559
submit the paper and of course like you

921
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,240
know there is a possibility

922
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,399
of presenting your paper in a

923
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,399
in a remote way but there is nothing

924
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,480
that replaces in person right

925
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,279
so

926
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,640
so given three months is just like um

927
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,159
it's almost impossible it's just like

928
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,919
saying like you know if you are from

929
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,919
this country and this country you will

930
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,960
never come um and this is something that

931
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,880
if it would be possible to replace and

932
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,120
to think about for example if just

933
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,039
having like more

934
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,519
time between the acceptance date and

935
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,919
also the the event that would be really

936
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,320
really helpful uh usually

937
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,559
from what i have heard from france from

938
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,080
north africa

939
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,320
for example as a data point

940
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,919
it's around six months

941
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,760
uh to get an appointment

942
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,519
and usually like a week or two to get

943
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,080
the visa so let's say six months so six

944
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,880
months is the average uh so

945
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,720
uh and it doesn't really depend whether

946
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
you are you have money in your account

947
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,320
it doesn't depend it's really like it's

948
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,480
a process that everybody needs to grow

949
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,080
to go through so

950
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,600
um yeah so this is the the the one maybe

951
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,519
suggestion too hot to at least you think

952
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,640
about you so yeah

953
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,080
yeah i think i think that definitely

954
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,519
makes sense and it's also important to

955
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,840
take into account that after copies

956
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,919
these six months in several places have

957
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,919
became like they become like three years

958
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,919
two years one year like it really

959
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,120
depends on the on the console the

960
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,799
drivers you're applying from

961
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,600
and i think so so there are there's a

962
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,519
big question our big debate about what

963
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,000
can we do as a community and i think

964
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,640
i don't think there's a simple and um

965
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,240
like single simple answer that you can

966
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,679
give to that i think it's something that

967
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,600
we have to build together all of us

968
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,039
those who are affected by it and those

969
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,039
who are not affected by it

970
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,880
uh but i do want to mention i mean it's

971
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,000
hard to be

972
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,679
concrete right about like we can do this

973
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,120
we can do that we can do this but i

974
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,279
think the first step towards solving

975
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,640
this issue it's a systematic issue and

976
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,919
it's also not an issue that i mean we

977
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,279
are just simple

978
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,440
uh walking citizens like this is a

979
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,279
governmental like this is a systematic

980
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,600
thing that we cannot solve but something

981
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,279
we can do at least

982
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,040
just be aware of it

983
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,800
just be aware of it

984
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,599
so

985
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,440
regarding something concrete how can you

986
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,280
be aware of it well being in this panel

987
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,719
like it's a great way of doing that but

988
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,320
also towards the next a an upcoming

989
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,639
is student communities in the different

990
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,760
conferences a good concrete idea

991
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,159
that you can apply is for instance

992
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,199
opening and closing remarks you can

993
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,440
thank explicitly the people who went

994
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,918
through the art was expensive and and

995
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,399
exhausting process of getting a visa and

996
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,440
managed to be at the conference and also

997
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,599
acknowledge those who perhaps couldn't

998
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,159
do it so that we just know oh there is a

999
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,639
list of people who wanted to be here and

1000
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,960
they just couldn't be here like couldn't

1001
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,239
it's not a matter of like oh they didn't

1002
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,800
do things in time or yeah they they just

1003
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,918
didn't

1004
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,280
whatever like they just didn't get a

1005
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,040
paper accepted and their institution

1006
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,160
doesn't allow them to travel if they

1007
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,000
didn't get access to a paper it's not

1008
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,920
about that it's really like it's it's is

1009
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,320
impossible so so i think this is

1010
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,160
something concrete that could be done to

1011
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,440
raise awareness

1012
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,520
and small steps like this could take us

1013
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,920
to our to a more healthy community where

1014
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,119
we understand someone came here

1015
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,359
from india or from certain regions in

1016
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,680
africa or from south america wow you did

1017
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,000
so much to be here it's so nice that you

1018
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
can be here i'm grateful that you're

1019
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,599
here so i think that's something we

1020
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,480
could do just as a start

1021
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,280
if

1022
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,680
if it's okay i

1023
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,960
would like to chime in

1024
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,520
um so i i think

1025
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,320
part of what i see um with hybrid

1026
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,880
conferences is that there is a way for

1027
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,280
people to attend and i i understand and

1028
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,119
hear the comments about how it's not a

1029
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,079
substitute or it's not a one-to-one

1030
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,760
equality with

1031
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,400
attending in person and i agree

1032
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,599
and

1033
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,240
i think that for some folks um it has

1034
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,640
been difficult to travel for whatever

1035
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,640
reason for covid for children for

1036
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,040
caregiving for visa problems you know so

1037
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,400
to

1038
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,680
urge

1039
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,440
future general chairs of conferences to

1040
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,680
please have hybrid and i know this

1041
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,200
sounds self-serving because i run the

1042
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,200
hybrid conferences i don't mean it like

1043
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,480
that i mean it in the sense of if iacr

1044
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,280
is an international organization then

1045
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,359
people from everywhere should be able to

1046
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,280
attend so i would just really urge

1047
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,240
future general chairs to consider the

1048
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,800
hybrid option

1049
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,320
that's all

1050
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,040
thanks thanks k

1051
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,640
mike

1052
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
mike can i just add something very brief

1053
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,119
to to what k just mentioned i think i

1054
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,119
just yesterday hear the story also in a

1055
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,960
conference it was not an icr conference

1056
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,680
but

1057
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,839
it was a hybrid event and there was this

1058
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,839
person who has a

1059
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,960
these two persons they have two papers

1060
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,320
and they agree that one of them will

1061
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,520
present one paper and the other will

1062
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,880
present the other paper

1063
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,760
one of them couldn't go because of visa

1064
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,280
and the conference

1065
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,520
chairs mentioned oh i mean that's fine

1066
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,119
your other

1067
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,440
colleague can present both papers

1068
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,920
and like i mean i need my face to be

1069
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,280
seen right this is important for my

1070
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,000
career but no we prioritize in person

1071
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,960
talks

1072
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,400
i know there is a psychological factor

1073
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,440
to it you're sitting here and you're

1074
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,040
either looking at the screen and there's

1075
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,160
no one to interact with or there is

1076
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,760
someone standing there looking at their

1077
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,760
face it may or may not matter but i

1078
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,920
think for this person not to present it

1079
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,160
really does matter so when we say when

1080
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,079
we say let's have hybrid conferences and

1081
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,839
only let's have them but it's actually

1082
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,839
be completely okay with person with

1083
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,160
people who cannot attend i think there

1084
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,320
has been certain pressure in not

1085
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,520
accepting

1086
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
online talks or like at least

1087
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,040
oh can you do something maybe someone

1088
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,200
else can present for you or like one of

1089
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,720
the six authors and at least one of them

1090
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,920
is there then why not let the author

1091
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,680
who's there i think it's important we

1092
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,800
also are

1093
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,839
accepting with this

1094
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,359
um so

1095
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,520
so not just on the on the side of

1096
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,160
organizing uh the conferences but just

1097
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,720
in general within our community uh to

1098
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,160
talk a little bit about like a culture

1099
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,240
of international respect so

1100
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,839
within our community these are not not

1101
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,599
maybe i see our

1102
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,720
official events but we have like

1103
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
regional events like the ones that come

1104
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,200
to my mind are like latin crypt indoct

1105
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,839
africa crypt um and i'm probably missing

1106
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,480
a few i apologize um

1107
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,560
the it seems like these events uh

1108
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,200
sometimes have kind of less stature than

1109
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,640
than they deserve like when you compare

1110
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,880
them against like similarly uh ranked

1111
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,359
conferences and so i'm wondering um is

1112
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,400
there something we can do within our

1113
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,119
community to sort of uh fix that and and

1114
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,560
you know improve the

1115
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,160
the culture of respect

1116
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,520
well i think it does i can start and um

1117
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,920
i think that uh you know

1118
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,599
hopefully in the future like

1119
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,440
i'm i'm being optimistic that africa

1120
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,520
creates latin crypt and in the crypt

1121
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,680
will will reach at some point

1122
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,240
the level of uh let's say a flagship you

1123
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,040
know

1124
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,480
crypto conference

1125
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,800
but i would say that there is

1126
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,440
something that icr can do a little bit

1127
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,040
to improve

1128
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,720
um

1129
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,839
like given the importance to these

1130
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,359
conferences like for example i would say

1131
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,520
for uh for africa crypts i know that

1132
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,000
iscr has some relationship to africa

1133
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,599
maybe it's an affiliated event or

1134
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,720
something like that i am not

1135
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,800
the um uh the exact you know um uh

1136
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,240
affiliation but

1137
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,000
uh one thing that it would be really

1138
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
helpful is that to have

1139
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
for example um

1140
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,160
summer schools that are affiliated to

1141
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,839
that conference for example africa

1142
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:56,720
crypts

1143
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,119
yes i understand that many students they

1144
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,800
would prefer submitting to a flagship

1145
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
because this helped their career and you

1146
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,560
know i this is completely understandable

1147
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,720
this is something that i do as well and

1148
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,400
you know this is just the system where

1149
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,839
we live in but if for example icr allows

1150
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:12,720
for

1151
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,160
or adds summer schools where they they

1152
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
they encourage really prominent

1153
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,119
cryptographers to give talks and you

1154
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,359
know for example for them just hey you

1155
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,200
know there is a summer school on npc

1156
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,720
summer school on encrypted search or

1157
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,839
summer school

1158
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,160
on any topic and they will invite many

1159
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,800
researchers to go there physically in

1160
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,000
person so it has a lot of advantages uh

1161
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,920
first of all the student of that region

1162
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,800
or that country can fly or can just go

1163
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,119
there to meet in person with with really

1164
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,359
researchers they just hear or just see

1165
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,000
in videos but also it will serve as an

1166
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,400
education because like really like many

1167
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,839
of the countries like i'm speaking at

1168
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,079
least from north africa is that we don't

1169
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,839
really need i mean yes conferences they

1170
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,160
are great but what really we need there

1171
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,000
is really um tutorials schools to help

1172
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
like really the student there to to

1173
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,839
interact with researchers to learn about

1174
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,240
a topic and as

1175
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,760

1176
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,520
you know he was lucky to find this

1177
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,160
person who told him exactly what to do

1178
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,680
this something like it will take maybe

1179
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,760
an hour for if you are senior but you

1180
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,480
know if you don't have that help it will

1181
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,800
take years and maybe if you do it wrong

1182
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,280
you are all all set for your career so

1183
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,880
sometimes like you know these small

1184
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,319
helps like when you just have a

1185
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,079
one-on-one chat with a senior person

1186
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,839
it's really helpful so so definitely i

1187
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,160
think that if icr can invest a little

1188
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,720
bit into adding really

1189
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,560
good summer schools like that which

1190
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,680
would be really helpful for this

1191
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,200
conference and hopefully in the long

1192
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,720
term it will help

1193
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,400
you know maybe paper people will start

1194
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,920
submitting to these conferences because

1195
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,760
they know researchers are there and you

1196
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,839
know it will help you know bring in this

1197
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,640
conference a little bit

1198
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,520
yeah i can encourage uh you from my

1199
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,280
personal experience i can encourage uh

1200
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,040
attendance at some of these conferences

1201
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,040
um i only have personal experience with

1202
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,440
the indo crypt but attending indocrypt

1203
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,760
was probably the most successful

1204
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,240
recruitment activity i ever did

1205
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,680
in terms of recruiting grad students so

1206
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,760
i was invited to give a tutorial there

1207
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,960
and one thing i didn't realize was that

1208
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,800
students from all over the country

1209
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,880
anyone who's interested in crypto

1210
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,960
comes to indocrypt uh anyway everyone

1211
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,800
who can at least and so

1212
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,160
there are students from all over the

1213
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,240
country uh attending the tutorials at

1214
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,880
indocrypt and as a result of that trip

1215
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,200
um i saw the

1216
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,040
i saw lots of

1217
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,880
you know i'm not used to seeing students

1218
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,560
who necessarily know about crypto

1219
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,200
applying to my university uh in the main

1220
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,640
pool and then all of a sudden there were

1221
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,319
like students who knew about

1222
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,520
cryptography and knew about garbled

1223
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,960
circuits in the uh

1224
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,440
in the pool and as a result i uh i got

1225
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,960
one of the students to come and uh she

1226
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,040
has a paper here at crypto this year it

1227
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,680
was a great success so um i know maybe a

1228
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,079
selfish motivation but uh i definitely

1229
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,560
encourage my colleagues to

1230
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,000
think about

1231
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,440
attending some of these

1232
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,599
more regional conferences

1233
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,680
i just wanted to add something as a you

1234
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,079
know in my capacity as a member of the

1235
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,599
board of directors

1236
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,440
um you know if you want to lead by

1237
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,200
example you don't have to wait for the

1238
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,720
icr to come and organize a summer school

1239
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,400
where you feel one is needed in fact um

1240
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,440
you can organize it yourself and and uh

1241
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,319
ask the icr do

1242
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,880
to help fund it we have a schools

1243
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,160
committee we accept proposals for for

1244
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,960
icr schools in various subjects and

1245
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,079
areas

1246
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,359
and when considering these proposals we

1247
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,680
definitely value geographic

1248
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,440
diversity so we like seeing proposals

1249
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,880
that are from

1250
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,240
on from

1251
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,599
from areas

1252
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,599
where it's currently difficult for

1253
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,520
researchers to attend our flagship

1254
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,079
conferences

1255
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,480
maybe i can chime on giving the latin

1256
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,640
crypt version of it so i attended the

1257
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,640
laticrim latin crypt in person only

1258
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,800
during my phd a couple of times and it

1259
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,720
was a lovely conference so i don't

1260
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,079
understand these comments it's like so

1261
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:08,880
great

1262
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,839
like

1263
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,760
first of all of course what we can do as

1264
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,599
a community is some make your papers

1265
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:14,560
there

1266
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,720
second you go to very nice places you

1267
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,400
have amazing people that are super

1268
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,040
hospital and you know what the wi-fi is

1269
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,440
usually iffy but this means you actually

1270
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,280
talk with people

1271
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,200
and there aren't that many people so i

1272
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,760
had you know a one-to-one chat with the

1273
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,400
shamira for 10 minutes in cuba

1274
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,560
who else gets that chance

1275
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,560
so it can give you different things that

1276
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,160
you don't get at such a large conference

1277
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,680
where i won't have the time to actually

1278
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,000
talk to everyone and to know things

1279
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,960
about every one of you

1280
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,040
right yeah so um

1281
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,520
just to to to compliment them what about

1282
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,280
the icr conferences and so on i think

1283
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,280
there is an important i want to share a

1284
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,839
quick story so when i was a

1285
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,760
during my undergrad it was a reading

1286
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,280
papers and then you see papers published

1287
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,440
everywhere and you like crypto eurocrypt

1288
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,920
asia crypt africa crypt blood encrypt

1289
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,200
into crypt and name it crypt all of it

1290
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,599
means the same for for you it's like i i

1291
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,599
don't really have any ranking on any of

1292
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,560
this

1293
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,920
and it was very exciting i was like oh

1294
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,680
wow we have geographical location i mean

1295
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,480
it's like

1296
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,839
it's like you have the world cup and

1297
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,520
like everyone goes to the world cup and

1298
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,040
and latin america is equally important

1299
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,000
as african-american asia it's like like

1300
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,359
all these regions matter and like you're

1301
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,720
all the same they're like use the local

1302
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,000
original cops or or whatever

1303
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,599
it came as a surprise that started

1304
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,760
progressing that like like people will

1305
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,599
tell me

1306
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,400
yeah

1307
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,680
oh there is something called login creep

1308
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,040
oh i didn't know but this isn't cool

1309
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,720
africa there you know i like there are

1310
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,960
many more that i don't even know

1311
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,560
so so i think

1312
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,839
the first thing that could happen that

1313
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,520
could could be done is that like making

1314
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,280
these conferences be better is an effort

1315
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,640
that is an effort that we also have to

1316
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,119
be engaged with it's a matter of

1317
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,200
stop joking about this paper is so bad

1318
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,720
that they won't even accept it at africa

1319
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,640
crypt because i have heard this

1320
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,359
personally so stop joking about this

1321
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,720
that's the first step and then from that

1322
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,240
we can jump to saying this paper you

1323
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,040
know what is good we it deserves being

1324
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,480
there and i think

1325
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,119
we've seen recent conferences that

1326
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,400
are born

1327
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,599
because

1328
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,400
enough people with enough credentials

1329
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,040
if i'd say you know what this looks good

1330
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,800
let's create a conference let's all give

1331
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,160
value to it like bitcoin you know like

1332
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,480
oh let's let's give value to it and then

1333
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,000
it has value

1334
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,839
so so there is one thing obvious they

1335
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,760
just reaching consensus that this should

1336
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,880
be a thing

1337
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,359
uh but second it

1338
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,720
take the string committees from this

1339
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,319
conference and so on it's a joint effort

1340
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,160
they should also limit the amount of

1341
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,760
papers to raise the bar of course it's

1342
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,280
gonna be like a free

1343
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,520
ride like there should be a marriage to

1344
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,960
become like a much of a better

1345
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,480
recognized conference it should be a

1346
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,319
joint effort from the community and also

1347
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,400
from the syrian communities and just

1348
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,480
along those lines i also want to mention

1349
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,960
that um well as i said i thought there

1350
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,640
was a geographical association to them

1351
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,680
and so on

1352
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,079
but but it's clearly political like like

1353
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,760
why is africa trip less quality than

1354
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,280
eurocrypt

1355
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,560
someone please come and tell me that's a

1356
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,720
coincidence because that's not so i want

1357
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,000
to

1358
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,280
just again this is this is where

1359
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,640
everyone can dream but like what about

1360
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,800
removing geographical tags to

1361
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,160
conferences

1362
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,079
like it could be a thing like what have

1363
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,240
eurocrypt and crypto

1364
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,400
which is essentially use crypto or asia

1365
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,480
crypt why not just have different

1366
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,440
conferences that jump from one place to

1367
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,839
the other every year and if i cannot

1368
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,520
make one i can always make the other i

1369
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,960
know these statements are very bold and

1370
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,720
like hard to make and so on but it's

1371
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,480
good just to let it go to the air

1372
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,000
because it's good to be aware of these

1373
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,920
of these things i think what if you

1374
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,400
could pick where to present according to

1375
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,839
you know maybe you cannot travel far

1376
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,079
away or maybe dates that collide with

1377
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,280
some personal things and then you can

1378
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,040
present to another conference

1379
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,680
once it's accepted yeah so so i i think

1380
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,520
i think i think what to do on how to

1381
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,440
solve it is a big deal that we could we

1382
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,040
can solve this right now but like i know

1383
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,119
daniel shooty for example before just

1384
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,800
gave a very interesting suggestion like

1385
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,599
why not having a single i mean again

1386
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,520
this is just like oh why not of course

1387
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,960
we're not gonna do this but like we're

1388
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,640
not having just a single event with all

1389
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,079
the flagships into it and there are like

1390
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,079
different issues so to speak uh they're

1391
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,359
gonna take part in different places

1392
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:12,640
you're playing you submit to one you can

1393
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,640
accept it to this very single conference

1394
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,880
but like okay you get to publish in the

1395
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,599
one that happens this time in chile and

1396
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,119
you get to publish in the one that

1397
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,119
happens in indonesia and it's all the

1398
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,200
same conference we all got accepted to

1399
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,839
crypto or to the icr

1400
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,760
conference suit or whatever we want to

1401
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,920
call it but like just a single thing

1402
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,280
anyway i don't think this is gonna

1403
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,119
happen anytime soon but i think just

1404
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,200
brainstorming about this is healthy just

1405
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,319
talking about it i think is healthy

1406
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,680
yeah we have seen the community is

1407
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,680
growing the number of paper is growing

1408
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,640
we need a new model anyway

1409
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,800
yeah this all sounds like a really uh

1410
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,960
informative uh productive feedback for

1411
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,280
the the discussions that are going along

1412
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,240
in the

1413
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,559
in the iacr board about the

1414
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,480
revamping rethinking the publication so

1415
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,079
i would just encourage

1416
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,680
the people on the on the panel here who

1417
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,079
have uh strong opinions and big ideas to

1418
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,680
participate in the and people in the

1419
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,680
audience as well to participate in the

1420
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,599
the discussions on the icr chat uh

1421
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:13,040
chat.iacr.org there's a discussion for

1422
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,920
um

1423
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,760
publications if i'm not mistaken

1424
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,359
we are we are

1425
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,760
nearing the end um i have like 10

1426
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,839
million other things we could talk about

1427
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,680
um but i wanted to make sure if anyone

1428
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,680
in the audience has like some

1429
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,520
something burning thing that they would

1430
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,920
like to contribute please go ahead

1431
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,720
yeah um so it hasn't really been said so

1432
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,400
i want to say it explicitly i really

1433
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,760
think it's amazing that this is

1434
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,319
happening now this this panel thank you

1435
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,520
very much

1436
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,800
thank you for being here

1437
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,520
um

1438
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,640
and i just want to stress that

1439
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,559
leading by example and visibility are

1440
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,800
two very important things and

1441
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,800
you know i'm i'm not a woman but the

1442
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,720
fact that there is now a meetup for

1443
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,040
women in cryptology that shows also hey

1444
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,960
we as a community care about this that's

1445
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,559
where the event is here

1446
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,480
uh the same applies to you know queer

1447
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,160
crypt which kind of was a rogue thing at

1448
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,000
europe but the fact that this exists and

1449
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,359
that that is there

1450
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:14,720
i mean even if you're queer and you

1451
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,160
don't end up going to it or if you're

1452
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,079
not queer and you and you don't

1453
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,160
necessarily are in the target target

1454
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,400
audience it still shows like

1455
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,240
this is a community that cares about it

1456
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,400
this is what the values are

1457
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,240
uh that there are pronoun stickers by

1458
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,000
the way i think is really cool as well

1459
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,520
at this conference

1460
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,839
i mean for many people this might not be

1461
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,839
something that they personally need by

1462
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,400
but by them being available and by many

1463
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,880
people using that you show okay people

1464
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,040
that are you know in a in a gender

1465
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,040
minority you are accepted as well we

1466
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,359
facilitate you being here and we we love

1467
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:48,640
that you're here

1468
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,599
um so i really want to to encourage

1469
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,240
everyone in our community to keep

1470
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,480
showing that that you care and keep

1471
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,319
making things visible and

1472
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,040
uh often it's like the small gestures

1473
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,520
that really help a lot uh and the and

1474
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,920
the big gestures like this event are

1475
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,640
help even more so i really hope that

1476
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,040
this is not a one one of thing uh these

1477
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,559
examples that i now mentioned that they

1478
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:13,359
keep

1479
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,760
continuing and everyone i think in in

1480
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,839
this community can help doing those

1481
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,480
things and keeping that vibe going and i

1482
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,200
really hope we can make that happen

1483
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,439
thank you

1484
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,720
hi

1485
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,480
i just want to make a small comment i

1486
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,160
unfortunately was not able to see the

1487
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,319
majority of this panel i just came for

1488
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,160
the last few minutes because i was at

1489
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,160
the women's event

1490
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,000
i think that's really unfortunate and i

1491
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,920
just wanted to bring up that

1492
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,640
these events are really important like

1493
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,760
really really important and i think that

1494
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,280
it would be great to recognize that

1495
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,680
there are inter intersecting issues that

1496
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,319
are impacting um people in more than one

1497
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:59,200
way so i'm a woman i'm i'm queer

1498
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,440
um i you know i'm jewish like there's

1499
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,200
identity aspects that we all have that

1500
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,800
we all bring to the table and they're

1501
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,480
all different and they're all like

1502
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,520
coming together um so i think that

1503
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,200
uh

1504
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,880
i would have liked to be here for this

1505
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,400
panel and hear your thoughts on all of

1506
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,319
this so maybe next year we can do

1507
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,400
something more intersectional

1508
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,760
and forever

1509
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,760
to come together and be together in this

1510
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,079
space

1511
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,760
sorry i just want to point out that this

1512
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,839
is recorded so you can watch it later

1513
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,800
so

1514
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,359
out of respect for everyone's time it it

1515
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:40,800
seems like it's about time to wrap up

1516
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,680
we've scheduled an hour for this event

1517
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,520
and it occurs to me that we have lots of

1518
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,200
brainstorming uh just questions for

1519
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,800
discussions that we should probably save

1520
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,280
for the next iteration of this event i

1521
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,800
look forward to uh

1522
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,480

1523
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,800
