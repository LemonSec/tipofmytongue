1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
calling in from Europe and Israel

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,360
I guess it is 10 46 so we can we can get

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,380
started

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,900
so John Jack whenever you're ready and

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,340
then just yes tell me the next slide

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,240
when you want to advance

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,279
hello

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,000
everybody yeah

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,259
yeah it's okay

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,420
a little louder

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,820
okay

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,780
so we will speak a little bit about the

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,940
memory scope maybe if you don't know

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,300
doctor maybe you'll do a little bit

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,459
uh next slides please

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,219
well in fact we we have a new challenge

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,820
at the moment uh it is breaking Quantum

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,579
resistant I'll go before the quantum

19
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,520
computer and the race is really

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,620
beginning to see

21
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,780
uh as here he prayed for sidh three

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,299
papers at the moment not speaking about

23
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,119
the Red Bull or this morning and see

24
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,780
also a case where they are also a lot of

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,240
characteristic paper about that

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,259
uh next slide

27
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:26,220
so we see the three paper here so we I

28
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,080
will go fast

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,080
exploring

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,560
okay and

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,220
next slide sorry

32
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,340
so we are in polynomial term at the

33
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,979
moment

34
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,320
it's not exactly what we can expect

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,259
except for come to computers

36
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,659
the next slide

37
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,219
and in fact we are no

38
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,259
what we call

39
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:03,659
maybe all-time classification is the

40
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,479
classification of today in fact so the

41
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,679
the prediction was classical Algos will

42
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,879
be broken by counting computer action

43
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,599
can replace by Contour resistant Argos

44
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,180
yeast and prediction then condom

45
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,340
computer appears

46
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,060
a bit in fact

47
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,080
what we have is action we started as a

48
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,660
new algo

49
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,560
we the next action we break the alcohol

50
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,640
and in fact writing the paper is slower

51
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,780
the than the the attacks at the moment

52
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,239
and prediction waiting for a computer

53
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,580
account of computer

54
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,060
so it's time to change an acceleratory

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,200
uh

56
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,040
uh yes next slide again

57
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,860
so it's time to change vocabulary uh not

58
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,379
speaking about past count of algorithms

59
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:14,519
but Pray Post uh different in fact come

60
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:15,659
to album

61
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,620
and forever ECC and so on we have to

62
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,099
speak about dominant algo so we need to

63
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,159
come back to keep analyze the farmer

64
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,260
ones to be sure

65
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,980
and for that my microscope and maybe you

66
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,120
don't know that but it was invented here

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,500
at UCSB so here is the object

68
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,799
next slide

69
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,879
uh

70
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,220
next slide sorry

71
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,920
okay so here is the object uh

72
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,939
there is a button next slide

73
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:01,379
and what you see is that there are two

74
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,340
in factors and from Santa Barbara and in

75
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,659
fact for UCSB it was invented in the 60s

76
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,859
next slide

77
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,579
uh so you you see

78
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,579
the

79
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,660
drawing from the the patterns

80
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,080
and the next slide

81
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,400
uh so there are uh watch using it next

82
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,820
slide

83
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,120
and it is magical next slide

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,400
so uh remember the story twinkle to you

85
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,680
uh 20 years ago our world and we propose

86
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,380
to replace it by an extension of

87
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,600
microscope

88
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,660
for doing the same thing

89
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,380
next slide

90
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,440
well here is a paper addition next slide

91
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,120
the order run by addition here and

92
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,639
October and we go to the conclusion

93
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,360
sorry I don't have time to explain or to

94
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,560
go to uh for manuscript to meet uh

95
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,900
School

96
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,919
this time to come back to a new

97
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,000
cataclypt conference

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,440
to see your catacly document in the next

99
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,680
weeks and thanks for your attention

100
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,400
foreign

101
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,759
once you're ready just let me know

102
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,199
okay I think we're I think we're ready

103
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,060
great next slide

104
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,740
so welcome everyone thank you for

105
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,220
staying for delay ah let me first thank

106
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,919
you for staying uh till the last session

107
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,660
of the ram session I know it's very late

108
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,840
there in California and I'm very sorry I

109
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,060
couldn't attend in person please next

110
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,500
slide

111
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,840
so I want to discuss a result with my

112
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,120
student Shivam gosh and this is about a

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,580
Russian Standard the advanced crypto Pro

114
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,060
key meshing acpkm now this is a mode of

115
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,819
operation for Ricky once you exchange a

116
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,440
key you want to have the key which is

117
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,080
fresh so you keep on changing the keys

118
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,240
without the interaction so this is a

119
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,180
mode of operation for raking without

120
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,580
additional freshness and this is a

121
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,400
predecessor of a project of the protocol

122
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,280
crypto Pro key meshing cpkm which was

123
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,000
proposed in 2016. this mode ACP game was

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,479
actually proposed by smeshirev in 2019

125
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,120
actually it was adopted by ietf you can

126
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,479
find it as an informational RFC 8645 and

127
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,199
it was accepted by ISO ten one one six

128
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,479
and the days that you have a key which

129
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,819
is keep updated every take they use the

130
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,620
term section so you have a bunch of

131
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,319
blocks which are sections and the

132
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,759
encryption itself is done using a

133
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,139
counter mode so I'm going to show you

134
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,740
the mode next slide please

135
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,099
and data is as follows you start you you

136
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:36,479
exchange a key using your favorite

137
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,500
methods whether it's a dictatorship

138
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,440
secure or not it's your choice and then

139
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,360
you have a set of contents and you just

140
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,120
encrypt them under the ALT key depending

141
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,160
on the number of the the block size and

142
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,419
the key length the number of constants

143
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,819
that you need and then you take the most

144
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,560
significant bits of the string that you

145
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,500
need and now if you look very carefully

146
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,780
both the RFC and the iso have a proposal

147
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,580
for this constants and there's one very

148
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,979
important aspect of this constants they

149
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:08,400
have to be chosen in such a way that the

150
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,099
cons the there is no way to get nons

151
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,800
concatenated with the counter which is

152
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,599
equal to one of the constants otherwise

153
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,400
otherwise because of the counter mode

154
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,379
you're going to release the key and

155
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,080
there is some technicalities there but

156
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,599
both of them have a series both our C

157
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:25,919
and ISO have a proposals for the

158
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,160
concepts so next slide please

159
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,319
so here is a problem with the skin if

160
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,240
you look very carefully of the update

161
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,039
function this is actually the new

162
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,399
section key is the application of a

163
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,640
random function to the ALT key and this

164
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,459
means that as you progress as the number

165
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,620
of section increases the entropy goes

166
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,720
down and we know this is a very very

167
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,080
well known result and it has been used

168
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,000
multiple times in cryptography next

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,680
slide please

170
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,519
actually what we found out that the

171
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,800
reduction was usually analyzing the

172
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,600
sense of the number of possible Keys

173
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,180
what is called h0 entropy actually if

174
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,740
you look at the real entropy the Shannon

175
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,720
entropy the drop is higher and actually

176
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,459
if you look at the

177
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,860
um guessing entropy the agent Infinity

178
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,339
it is even lower meaning that the drop

179
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,560
is significant is larger which means

180
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,480
that the entropy of the key in the 500

181
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,899
section is much smaller than for the

182
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,820
beginning so there is a very simple

183
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,440
solution for that that we can easily

184
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,760
amend the standards such that we demand

185
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,519
High entropy keys to begin with OR limit

186
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,040
the number of updates so this ensures

187
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,080
that the security doesn't degrade too

188
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,940
much

189
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,180
uh but wait there is more next slide

190
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,339
please

191
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,000
so apparently

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,920
when the block size is not a multiple of

193
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,779
eight the constants which were proposed

194
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,180
actually allow the situation of IV

195
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,580
concatenated with counter equaling being

196
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,860
equal to one of the constants now when

197
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,360
this is the case I remind you that in

198
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,180
counter mode we just release the

199
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,480
encryption of the ivx reduce the counter

200
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,320
which when it happened to be the I this

201
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,600
means that you release parts of the key

202
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,899
of some section and this is obviously a

203
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,820
bad thing because it hurts the following

204
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,740
sections as well so there are two

205
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,060
possible solutions for that problem

206
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,880
first of all is to change constants

207
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,880
which might be useful and another option

208
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,399
is to just prevent the use of

209
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,899
non-multiple of eight block sizes

210
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,339
because the constants were designed for

211
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,660
that sort of Block ciphers online

212
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,980
oh

213
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,600
but wait there is more

214
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,640
so apparently if there are differentials

215
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,899
in the scheme and I see that there are

216
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,560
some apparently I'm I'm over time but if

217
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,180
there is such a scheme

218
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,800
um a differential hyperbility

219
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,240
differential it might be a bit of a

220
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,440
problem in your scheme okay I'm out of

221
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,660
time so I'm out of it but there are

222
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,940
other problems as well just to conclude

223
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,399
to solve the problem of icpkm either

224
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,019
you're in showcase that start with a lot

225
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,279
of entropy and you have to update

226
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,899
constants and you make sure that the

227
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,060
block size is not a multiple of a and

228
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,640
that there are no hidden or just happen

229
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,079
to be there either related key

230
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,700
differences or regular differentials in

231
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,920
the design or just use something which

232
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,040
is more secure especially please hurry

233
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,760
up please hurry up

234
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,180
experience

235
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,920
thank you

236
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,579
yes yes okay so uh thank you so I'd like

237
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,920
to talk about how we do our publication

238
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,980
at iscr and it's a former lecture that

239
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,079
Michelle was describing gentlemanship

240
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,700
meeting and trying to explain in more

241
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,220
details uh what I need to talk about

242
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,360
next please

243
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,040
next slide please my job okay thank you

244
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,399
so you know that uh the icr conferences

245
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,220
are very successful we have a very good

246
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,800
papers very good presentations the whole

247
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,440
system works relatively well but also

248
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,199
know that there are definitely some of

249
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,459
the current system uh for instance

250
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,380
because of papers that are iterated TV

251
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,540
submitted to the different conferences

252
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,459
because they need to travel when you

253
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,959
have a paper accepted you have to

254
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,360
present it we also have seen a drawing

255
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,620
over time and if you see some

256
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,720
adjustments and some Millennials are

257
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,180
mass represented about arguments in the

258
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,100
conferences so of course this has been

259
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,019
forecast for a while and some people

260
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,940
have tried to improve the situation and

261
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,220
we have actually moved forward over time

262
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:15,839
2013 there was a proposal to move all

263
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,639
our conferences to General Conference

264
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,560
hybrids it's going to work at the time

265
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,420
it's completely to start moving to try

266
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,360
to make proposals in 2015 remote to

267
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,920
double track that was a way to absorb

268
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,360
the growth and apparently we're going to

269
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,160
move to Triple tracks soon

270
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,339
in 2016 and 18 if the cmgs moved to a

271
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,199
hybrid Journal so this is like an echo

272
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,839
of a proposal from 2013 but some aliens

273
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,199
actually moved to hybrids and recently

274
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,180
we've had a proposal for a new Gmail has

275
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,660
been running

276
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,720
that complement them

277
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,560
so I think this is

278
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,459
some of our problems but actually we

279
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,620
need to work proposal is no way too too

280
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,779
small we need to talk Library about

281
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,220
hurricane Publications

282
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,540
and if we have

283
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,519
conference permission we should solve

284
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,100
them by modifying the conflict if you

285
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,380
just add something on your site you're

286
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,880
not going to fix the issues that are

287
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,620
really due to the conferences themselves

288
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,820
next slide please

289
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,920
thank you

290
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,920
so uh in order to make a proposal in

291
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,660
this direction I've written the document

292
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,579
that's available here you have a link

293
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,699
here it's also in the

294
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:43,740
chat.iscr.org I'm sharing the filter

295
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,800
definition

296
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,320
work my idea was to start from the

297
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,060
issues that we had in the current system

298
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,100
and try to discuss several ways that we

299
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,320
can solve them and I try to go to two

300
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,180
different directions one of them is to

301
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,519
make a short tweaks that we can apply

302
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,079
for the next conference

303
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,959
and the other one is to have a more

304
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,420
forward location to think a lot more a

305
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,220
more Global organization that will

306
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,560
require a little bit more work and the

307
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,300
main idea is to move to all conferences

308
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,420
to German hybrid it's reasonable is to

309
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,980
have an open discussion starting from

310
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,560
the problem and looking at Solutions so

311
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,600
please please tell me if you're missing

312
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,279
problems please tell me if some of the

313
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,839
solutions don't work or if you have

314
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,540
other ideas to solve the problem

315
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,540
next slide please

316
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,240
so for the vision for a long-term

317
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,820
organization perhaps something based on

318
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,440
General hybrids and to have two

319
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,560
different names so important about a

320
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,600
flagship Journal corresponding to crypto

321
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,660
the recrypt and the idea is that you

322
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,459
submit to virtual room initial paper is

323
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,800
accepted you are invited to submit that

324
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,660
one in the conferences

325
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,139
and then we would have a series

326
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,139
and then we have a series of ironia

327
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,480
journals for the different earlier

328
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,519
conferences that we have now but so each

329
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,300
area conference

330
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,900
I'm sorry

331
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,919
I'm sorry

332
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,740
having network issues so the first thing

333
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,419
is that we need with this system we have

334
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,819
a clear separation of the different

335
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,199
journals each one has a clear

336
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,240
positioning and we have to identified

337
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,579
tiers for the flagship and for the areas

338
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,439
and this is actually similar to what

339
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,820
they're doing with the American physical

340
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,220
Society but we have a flagship journals

341
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,740
and a thematic journals next slide

342
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,919
please

343
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,600
so just to explain a little bit The

344
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,820
Proposal uh let's start from the

345
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,919
problems so one of the problems the

346
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,840
resubmission problem because when you

347
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,640
submit to a conference your paper is

348
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,100
either accepted as it is or rejected

349
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,919
under the paper is rejected usually you

350
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,179
will submit it again to the

351
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,760
circumference or to a different one

352
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,679
so the reasons your resubmission will be

353
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,780
evaluated by a fresh set of reviewers

354
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,880
and this is really a waste of time for

355
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,700
reviewers and for authors in many cases

356
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,679
so as a short-term tweak what we could

357
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,840
do is to forward the reviews from one

358
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,700
program committee to the next at least

359
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,160
for the French Flagship conferences

360
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,919
there is already something from iecr

361
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,419
conference that you can use teaching

362
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,179
reviews but I think forwarding directly

363
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,700
the reviews from the PC would uh make

364
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,620
this smaller more efficient

365
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,960
and in order

366
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,900
what we can do is move

367
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,880
through journals and then to remove the

368
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,280
free Flagship conferences to a single

369
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,440
Journal it means that when you resubmit

370
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,120
from crypto to Azure Crypt it's really

371
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,160
the same Journal so if your data was

372
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,900
rejected you're not really supposed to

373
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,539
submit the same paper unless it has been

374
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,820
significantly modified and if your paper

375
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,340
was good but not quite good enough maybe

376
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,080
we will ask you for a revision and then

377
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,059
you have a clear idea of what you're

378
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,740
supposed to do and if you do it the same

379
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,140
users will accept your paper

380
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,160
next slide please

381
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,480
another problem that we had is a

382
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,100
requirement to travel and we know that

383
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,860
some people don't travel either because

384
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,600
of Visa because of your environment for

385
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,340
many different reasons

386
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,559
and when short-term solution to solve

387
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,539
this just keep to hybrid conferences

388
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,240
like we're doing today on the zoom and

389
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,460
uh we could decide where you see how to

390
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,559
keep this system in place and currently

391
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,480
it's not done each conference decides

392
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,580
from himself but maybe one shot and

393
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,320
three for us to need to completely

394
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,580
decide we will keep this

395
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,140
please discuss it and hopefully uh this

396
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,940
will help us move forward thank you

397
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,039
sorry

398
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,960
which I just had a wonderful breakfast

399
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,580
of whom was

400
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,460
um I would like to announce uh joint

401
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,580
competition with Nadine Nadeem and can

402
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,658
you please have the next slide

403
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,900
we would like to announce the best

404
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,360
crypto competition ever

405
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,000
um next slide please

406
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,880
no wow so you see our community has a

407
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,380
lot of cryptographic competitions we had

408
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,059
the AES and Essay in Eastchester and

409
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:34,919
Caesar and pqc in Lakewood crypto and

410
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,600
there are even some smaller competitions

411
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,900
like pH sales Etc but the thing is that

412
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,539
competitions are about to end very soon

413
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:43,740
and then they're going to be stuck

414
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,500
without competitions now next slide

415
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,600
please the problem with all of these

416
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,820
competitions I mean the the good part is

417
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,039
that they Inspire research and students

418
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,200
get their phds and actually it focuses

419
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,480
the community on real challenges and

420
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,980
then we have also a timeline so people

421
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,960
in Industry can predict when they're

422
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,280
going to have a new hash function

423
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,559
standard next slide please but there is

424
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,419
a big problem there first of all there's

425
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:07,919
a lot of wasted effort people are

426
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,360
working on breaking stuff that shouldn't

427
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,520
have been submitted to begin with and

428
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,080
the community is focused on some one

429
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,400
thing and not on other things for

430
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,600
example in the chatri competition

431
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,760
everybody were working on introducing

432
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,140
new ciphers and stopped working on

433
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,020
breaking shot 256 and sometimes the

434
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,100
problem which is defined in the

435
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,179
beginning of the process is

436
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,520
significantly different than the one

437
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,640
that we actually actually want to solve

438
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,440
and the thing is that do we really need

439
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,539
that many people's people with phds in

440
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,580
crypto I mean there is always already

441
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,740
too many of those you see you just so

442
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,299
get on this presentation there are way

443
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,580
too many submissions to begin with now

444
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,500
the thing is that it is something that

445
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,059
the crypto Community is failing

446
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:46,799
miserably is that we have this sort of

447
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,520
gatekeeping right we we only have

448
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,900
cryptographers winning these

449
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,039
competitions

450
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,140
and and I think this is actually a

451
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,799
horrible thing next slide please

452
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:00,600
uh so we're going to announce the best

453
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,400
and the newest crypto competition so we

454
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,740
have something to do next year who will

455
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,960
decipher the secret to a great rooms

456
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,320
next slide please

457
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,020
apparently in the Europe 2022 ramp

458
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,140
session Nadeem and I hosted a successful

459
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,140
collocated event you can see the link

460
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,840
over there and we decided to run a new

461
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,059
competition which is the chickpeas based

462
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,380
competition

463
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,960
the CPP

464
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,179
um you you should read it slightly

465
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,419
differently next slide please

466
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:36,000
so first of all no gatekeeping everybody

467
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,360
can participate this is a great thing

468
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,059
not only cryptographers second of all we

469
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,400
don't expect to increase the number of

470
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,380
PhD students that graduate due to this

471
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,419
competition so enough with the inflation

472
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:51,840
in the phds in cryptography to be honest

473
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,820
we're not planning to advance crypto

474
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,159
research and if you ate good foods

475
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,900
recently you you know that there is a

476
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,460
good chance that you're going to enjoy a

477
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,440
costume snap so it's actually going to

478
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,600
hinder the research due to that sort of

479
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,100
thing so we are consistent with several

480
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,400
other competitions next slide please

481
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,039
so easier rumors indistinguishable from

482
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,260
random can your homos be universally

483
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,000
composed with tahili

484
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,980
can your homeless recipe be shared among

485
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,780
ant players so we're looking for

486
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,240
evaluation board members whom suppliers

487
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,059
makers and of course sponsors

488
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:27,059
um next slide please the event is going

489
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,880
to be co-located with Europe 2023 so you

490
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,640
can find more information at our website

491
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,260
humanscript.org or on the on Twitter in

492
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,419
iscr homescript thank you very much for

493
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,280
your attention and for staying up late

494
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,280
foreign

495
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,480
that concludes our rump session so the

496
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,159
only piece of business that we have left

497
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,299
is the prizes

498
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,919
sorry brief Awards committee uh yeah

499
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:09,840
good yes okay

500
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,740
okay we have three prizes and they are

501
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,919
uh Cards Against cryptography decks

502
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:19,980
so we can all uh play with them later

503
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,539
