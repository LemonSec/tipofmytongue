1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,120
all right so we think the technological

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,200
difficulties are solved but if you're

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,880
not you know we can always submit this

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,759
to see fail next year

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:14,960
all right

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
um

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,400
now i have to advance slides

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,640
there we go okay

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,359
so we'll skip over this stuff you know

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,359
reduce the base case all right so yeah

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,800
so what do you say to people well first

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,238
you have a really awkward silence and

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,840
they all leave but if they come back and

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,760
pass you about it here's what you can

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,920
say then

16
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,719
i think staring blankly at a wall no

17
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,079
computer

18
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,239
to be found

19
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,440
cause i'm a theoretician

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,920
and my mind is the playground

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,760
but then the real world dumps my paper

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,240
in my lap

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,158
and ask but can you implement this crap

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,520
look i don't know how could i know we

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,119
lost contents like 14 papers ago this

26
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,880
construction's built from a history

27
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,799
[Music]

28
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,240
of leaving out the sea

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
use big oak

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
newspaper

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,280
don't need constants anymore

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,040
use they go

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,880
use big o

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,040
pesky numbers yeah ignore

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,520
i don't care

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,479
cause this peridone

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,360
says it's fast enough

38
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,439
it's cool as long as it's poly time

39
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,399
[Music]

40
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,599
it's funny how the limit

41
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,360
makes everything seem small

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,560
like physical restrictions

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,959
cost energy and all

44
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,560
it's time to see what i can do when i

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,760
can send a mistake it's really

46
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,840
obfuscation to you when that be fast so

47
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,800
when it's free

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,800
so free

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,280
no use big o

50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,640
is a long term bothering you

51
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,400
put it building

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,400
on

53
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,860
[Music]

54
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,640
red

55
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,800
you hold my protocols to slow for normal

56
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
ups

57
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,720
the sun would die out long before its

58
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,319
run time ever stops

59
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,080
but though you claim it's not efficient

60
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,200
at this crawl

61
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,760
we're asymptotic here your n is just too

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,239
small

63
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,640
use bigger

64
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
use big o

65
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,159
and constant work is just small fry use

66
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,599
big o

67
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,519
and then you know

68
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,680
so order turns go far

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,159
i don't care

70
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,200
because this peridone

71
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,920
says it's fast enough

72
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,519
it's cool as long as it's poly time

73
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,019
[Applause]

74
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,280

hello everyone i'm i'm hassan i'm a

165
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,120
computer science phd student at purdue

166
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,600
university uh today in this talk i'm

167
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,959
going to talk about conditional

168
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,120
encryption uh with the application after

169
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,839
our

170
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,360
password type of correction this is a

171
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,959
john varg with my advisor jeremy abalaki

172

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,800
consider the password-based

174
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,640
authentication schemes receive lots of

175
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,800
incorrect logging attempts some of them

176
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,160
from the original

177
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,120
user some of them are from the adversity

178
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,440
to try to extract the password of a

179
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,200
legitimate user but there are some

180
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,279
servers try to track these and current

181
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,600
lagging attempts and try to uh identify

182
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,000
some of them are legitimate or not try

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,040
to i

184
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,560
make sure that

185
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,640
some of them are correct correct and we

186
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,120
can use them for future logging

187
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
there is an if solution we can store all

188
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,279
these incorrect logging attempts in this

189
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,399
server

190
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,320
and but the thing is that in the future

191
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,279
data breach happens so the address can

192
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,920
look at the typos stored on the server

193
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,120
and

194
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,399
by simple uh doing some learning

195
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,800
algorithms try to extract the original

196
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,240
password from them

197
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,120
so

198
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,040
regarding to this issue um

199
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,200
there is a cool trick which is uh

200
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,160
introduces in uh this is um ccs 2070 by

201
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,320
chatterjee at all which is called tip

202
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,079
top the idea is

203
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,079
using public key cryptography issues

204
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,000
there is assigned a public key and a

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
secret key

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,959
and

207
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,200
we store the public in the server and

208
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,680
encrypt the secret key using the

209
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,079
password extracted from the

210
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,680
the the password

211
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,560
in future when you log in with the typo

212
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,760
so

213
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,519
the server will

214
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,279
look at your public key the user

215
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,519
publicly and encrypt this password and

216
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,160
store into the server and generate a

217
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,800
waitlist for future computation when you

218
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,040
when the user use the its original

219
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,279
password we can extract the secret key

220
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,360
and equip all this store

221
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,360
pass password ciphertext of the typo

222
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,200
attempts and then we can decide if we

223
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,959
can add them for future logging or not

224
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,360
so there is a specific issue in this

225
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,079
type of solution this is the the things

226
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,320
that we found at the in the

227
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,000
tip of construction so consider our user

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
is a little bit hanged over and doesn't

229
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,800
know which server is interacting so it

230
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,760
he tried to submit the uh his password

231
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,279
of the uh

232
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,519
the crypto server for the server is not

233
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,800
crypto so

234
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,760
the the the the

235
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,079
access is rejected so maybe he doesn't

236
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,240
know he tried to understand what is the

237
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,560
which is the password tried to

238
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,440
send another password the same the

239
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,639
the same

240
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,040
rejection happened so he gave up uh

241
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,320
doing some slash attempts so he goes uh

242
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,839
but the thing is that in the server you

243
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,920
can see the encryption of the other

244
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,480
other accounts password is encrypted in

245
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,519
this the server so then in the in the

246
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,240
early morning in the next day he is

247
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,760
so he's no not hangover is going to

248
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,839
log in with the original password

249
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:26,800
and

250
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
so the server decrypt all these

251
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,240
ciphertexts and realize the other

252
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,480
password accounts so this this may cause

253
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,000
some security issues so what we do so

254
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,160
this is the main challenge we try to we

255
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,880
want what we want is trying to store

256
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,360
avoid storing uh

257
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,440
logging attempts of the

258
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,040
password which are not

259
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,240
uh the original typo so we are trying to

260
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,760
so the thing is that we don't know what

261
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,959
is the original password so uh for this

262
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,600
for this uh way we try we introduce the

263
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,680
notion of conditional encryption

264
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,000
the idea is that you have a ciphertext

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
of an unknown message

266
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,040
and

267
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,839
a message and prime which is the payload

268
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,920
and the predicate defined so the

269
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,240
predicate basically says that if the

270
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,000
distance of password one and two is

271
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,639
closed we can extract

272
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,279
the output of this predicate is one so

273
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,440
based on the conditional encryption

274
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,920
we encrypt the messa the payload which

275
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,200
is in prime

276
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,600
in such a way we can extra extract c

277
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,079
prime so the idea is that

278
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,839
given the secret key

279
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,160
in the case that the predicate between m

280
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,560
and prime is not is satisfied we can

281
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,920
extract the

282
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,680
the message in prime

283
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,279
but

284
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,959
in the case that this

285
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,199
this predicate is not satisfied we are

286
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,040
not we cannot extract the original

287
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,120
password

288
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,320
so

289
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
the security implies that there is no

290
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,560
leakage between and prime whenever even

291
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,600
the addressing knows the secret key

292
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,720
so back to the problem so we can replace

293
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,160
the condition the the typical encryption

294
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
scheme with the conditional encryption

295
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,639
so we will see that in this case as the

296
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,120
other password can't have the

297
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,480
large distance from the original

298
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,240
password the

299
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,800
after the decryption we cannot extract

300
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,760
uh

301
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,079
that password so the the encryption

302
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:20,959
says

303
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,279
completely irrelevant messages to the

304
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,279
original message so yeah in this case

305
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,600
the adversary is not no longer able to

306
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,079
extract the message so basically we

307
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,399
implement the conditional encryption

308
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,320
using a paleo

309
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,560
partially homomorphic encryption and

310
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,480
then

311
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,440
there is a c plus plus

312
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,079
c plus plus library for that and we use

313
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,880
it to modify the the previous tip tab to

314
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,240
make sure that this

315
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,320
con the the the resulting construct

316
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,399
satisfied these predicates

317
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,399
which is the most common predicate thank

318
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,639
you so much for attention and of course

319
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,760
special thanks for my advisor adversary

320
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,040
typo

321
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,760
that uh simulate the transition by

322
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,480
shooting me with the raft on when i pass

323
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,560
the timing sorry

324
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,800
thank you

325
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,720
one

326
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
um

327
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,240
okay

328
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,680
hello i'm yongsik kim

329
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,639
and today i'm going to share

330
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,279
uh the latest fps implementation result

331
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,320
recently i my colleague and i have

332
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,519
been implementing the very deep

333
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,680
cnn holders

334
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,680
up to 111 layers this is my three

335
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,360
ok

336
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,720
okay motivation is very simple ai is our

337
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,199
day very important and security and

338
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,680
privacy is one of the major concerns

339
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,519
therefore we have to

340
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,680
we we are going to use that the pre-homo

341
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,240
encryption to resolve this problem the

342
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
means that there so protect the

343
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,399
encrypted data and processing without

344
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,560
decryption and produce the encrypted

345
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,600
output but most important problem is

346
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
that the primary encryption is too

347
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,880
heavy therefore previously when you work

348
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,959
try to redesign the h friendly networks

349
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,279
the means that the activation functions

350
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,160
are usually approximated with very low

351
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,639
degree polynomial and only very

352
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,760
shallow networks well we try to choose

353
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,079
the different approaches that means that

354
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,079
we are going to use data so the

355
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,280
downloaded

356
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,599
models from the internet therefore we

357
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,000
have to carefully uh design the high

358
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,720
degree approximation for the activation

359
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,359
functions we firstly implemented the

360
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,720
third or legendary 21st but issued at a

361
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,199
very high rate of shift and required

362
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,480
many

363
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,640
computational resources that means that

364
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,240
it takes three hours for one image in

365
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,799
turns with the 64 or thread cpu powers

366
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,200
therefore our main question is that it

367
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
is nearly

368
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,120
possible to evaluate bfcnn such as the

369
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,919
resonant 110 on fully homophobic

370
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,440
encryption environment

371
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,760
it was not yet implemented and

372
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,919
considered considering our previous

373
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,320
result it is too heavy may not be

374
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,600
possible therefore we have three

375
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,000
we developed three ingredients firstly

376
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,360
we present the high precision ckks

377
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,960
bootstrapping

378
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,280
to be able to complete arbitrary number

379
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,160
of homework operations also for the high

380
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,400
speed performance we devised the

381
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,200
multiplexed parallel convolutions to

382
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,440
reduce the number of ciphertext except

383
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,000
during generated during the operation

384
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,160
therefore as a result we can achieve

385
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,600
that there more than 130 times better

386
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
high state record

387
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,280
also when we first

388
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,440
test tested the very deep cnn model

389
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,000
we realized that we find that there are

390
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,480
too many capacitators are generated

391
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,320
during their computation therefore we

392
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
have to take care of them

393
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,240
then that is our result we when we only

394
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,120
use that the thing is thread we can

395
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,120
achieve it it takes that 2002

396
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,440
seconds for the resin at 20

397
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,080
it means that the thought is 36 minutes

398
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,600
for one image influence and also uh it

399
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,760
takes the thirteen thousands for the

400
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,840
resident

401
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,960
110 um

402
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,200
10 performance also when we use that

403
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,440
cpu parallelization that means that when

404
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,000
we use the 50 thread

405
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,480
at the same time the amount is time

406
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,039
showed that there are 79 seconds for the

407
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,200
resonance 20 and

408
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,080
455 seconds for the resonant 110 when it

409
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,200
comes to the classification accuracies

410
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,440
or the encrypted data also show that

411
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,160
almost the same digit same accuracy as

412
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,600
the plain text

413
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,679
in this simulation we only use that the

414
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,720
cpu powers there is no gpu no edge

415
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,600
hardware accelerators therefore i can

416
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,760
say that i can answer that the first

417
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,919
question is it nearly possible to

418
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,400
evaluate cnn such as lesson 110 on the

419
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,880
fully homophobic inclusion environment

420
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,559
my answer is yes

421
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,919
this is

422
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,080
the reference and you can find our

423
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,720
source code on that

424
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,919
url thank you

425
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,559
thank you

426
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,840
thank you

427
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,080
hi

428
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,240
so nice seeing you all my name is bohr

429
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,480
and the new intelheim and i'm gonna be

430
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,799
talking about my hot crypt of summer i

431
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,480
don't know if the term hot crap this

432
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,120
summer means anything to you well it

433
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,720
does to me

434
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,080
it's luckily also on the urban

435
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
dictionary actually

436
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,080
uh the hot crypt of summer

437
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,760
summer full of fun

438
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,360
coach max says

439
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,440
hot girl summer is just about being you

440
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
having fun it's turning up driving the

441
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,720
boat and not giving it down what

442
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,400
nobody's saying

443
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,679
it's about the summer where you're in

444
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,080
charge of your own happiness

445
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,280
that's where we are right that's where

446
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,559
the community is at actually and my my

447
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,240
my hot crypto summer's been great so far

448
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,559
you know it started eurocrypt rondheim i

449
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,559
don't know those who know they know was

450
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,679
great

451
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,080
taking taking amtrak here actually also

452
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,840
great surprisingly

453
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,360
shrimp

454
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,080
chocolate covered strawberries i've been

455
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,280
having a time the hot this summer

456
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,400
i'm ready

457
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,880
nothing could go wrong

458
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,159
psych

459
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,919
oh wait sorry psych

460
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,520
um you know

461
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,039
we know we know where we are right we

462
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,640
had the four the four and this things

463
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,559
and then that's out and i don't know how

464
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,720
this is for you but when i when it was

465
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,080
like few weeks ago and i was reading

466
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,720
this news part of me was like

467
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,200
oh there's gonna be drama at crypto

468
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,799
and another part of me was like oh

469
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,280
there's gonna be drama at crypto

470
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,400
because that's you know that's why we're

471
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,120
here and actually uh we're not really a

472
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,720
stranger to drama in the crypto

473
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,000
community i don't know if you're aware

474
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,159
of this i saw some emails recently uh

475
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,840
here this thing like oh yeah if you

476
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,440
cracked the abc yeah you thought it was

477
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,520
good something else did you

478
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,760
the the anyone who cracks the abc thing

479
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,000
will be given 400 000

480
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,960
bonus and then lawrence and matthias the

481
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,799
madman they were like oh yeah here it is

482
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,640
lol did you get the money

483
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,720
lawrence you get the money no then they

484
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,880
don't get the money

485
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,440
but you know the drama didn't end there

486
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,400
i don't i don't know i i recently uh man

487
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,919
uh i don't know if you're familiar with

488
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,280
this website twitter.com

489
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,679
if you like crypto drama this is this is

490
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,280
where you go

491
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,760
except if you go to the pqc forum which

492
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,120
is also

493
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,440
generally

494
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,360
it's it's even better

495
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,400
it's it's similar but with like the

496
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,880
fewer hashtags and stuff

497
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,000
no it's not been going that well uh you

498
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,080
could say with regards to the hot crypt

499
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,360
of summer

500
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,520
there was trouble in paradise

501
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,360
or or not depending on what you like

502
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,039
there was someone else who said you know

503
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,039
we have some crypto drama where crypto

504
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,880
means cryptography

505
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,360
this is kind of rare

506
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,039
there's someone else i took this wealthy

507
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,039
out of context so if i've i've uh

508
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,960
rejected the name you said given recent

509
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,640
discussions on cryptography twitter i'm

510
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,720
afraid crypto 2022

511
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,280
will be a show well

512
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
it's not that bad luckily but it made me

513
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,440
think you know it made me think about

514
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,640
where we are

515
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,679
as a community and as as you know

516
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,320
people with a common goal because

517
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,799
i i was wondering can we can we turn

518
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,840
this into an opportunity for us

519
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
because huh

520
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,320
we we you know we're there yeah exactly

521
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,520
but you can also look at it in a

522
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,080
positive way you know there is

523
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,600
there's a whole there's something here

524
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,039
you know there's there's a place for

525
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,640
something new here

526
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,440
can we maybe make a new cryptographic

527
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,240
primitive instead

528
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,679
what yeah what would the what would the

529
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,919
one-way function be

530
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,799
i know i have a new pqc candidate i hope

531
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,640
the nist guys are paying attention and

532
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,880
it is drama-based cryptography

533
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,679
i'm

534
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,120
here we go

535
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,520
here we go this is the function it takes

536
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,720
a a trivial input i

537
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,960
and then you know it

538
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,840
lots of there's lots of stuff going on

539
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,360
uh

540
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,120
and and this will be called the fighting

541
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,000
cryptographers problem fcp

542
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,240
and fcp has many amazing properties

543
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,080
let's have a closer look actually is it

544
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,799
one way yes it is no way to understand

545
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,559
what input has caused a certain result

546
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,039
to appear

547
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,559
i'll do you one better actually it's

548
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,320
actually better than one way because

549
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,919
most cryptographers will look at the

550
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,640
output and they'll be like no way this

551
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,039
is safe

552
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,960
you might wonder is there forward

553
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,880
secrecy well yes there is output is

554
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,400
often random even with identical input

555
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,559
and yet it keeps repeating

556
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,799
and you might wonder does the fcp

557
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,520
generate output efficiently

558
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,400
sadly it does we've all found out

559
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,039
so it's great

560
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,440
this seminal work of course makes you

561
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,880
wonder

562
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,720
is there really not a way

563
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,960
to fight you know to solve the fighting

564
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,039
cryptographer's problem is there really

565
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,600
nothing and this really like i've been

566
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,120
thinking about this for a while and i

567
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,200
had a heart to heart with you know some

568
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,080
esteemed members of the community and we

569
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,840
we talked about it and we concluded that

570
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,360
well yes we can

571
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,520
we can solve the fighting cryptographers

572
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,480
problem with constructive discussion

573
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
by listening to each other all of us as

574
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,600
a community and with mutual respect

575
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,440
in other words not in sub-exponential

576
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,039
time i thank you very much

577
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,919
hello everyone i'm here to tell a fairy

578
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,960
tale

579
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,440
uh this is uh based on joint work with

580
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,520
omkan and yamakova titled that a new

581
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,159
approach to post quantum number ability

582
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,640
so let's begin the adventure

583
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
see one day alice is going for an

584
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,120
auction and uh

585
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,440
the target is this watch and as you can

586
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
see she really wants this watch because

587
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,039
this is the watch

588
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,679
and the auctioneer starts by explaining

589
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,279
the rules so

590
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,520
all the bidders commit their commit to

591
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,120
their prize first

592
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,799
after this stage

593
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,799
the auctioneer announced the beginning

594
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,039
of the decommitment stage

595
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,440
whoever pays the highest price will get

596
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,000
this watch

597
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
for example in this case alice will get

598
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,760
this watch

599
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,159
however after appearing in so many

600
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,080
crypto papers alice now is already a

601
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,360
cryptographer

602
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,120
he quickly realized that this is not

603
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,159
secure wait this is unfair said that is

604
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,799
i can show a potential tag

605
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,960
for example

606
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,399
this cat

607
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,039
he can intercept my commitment

608
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,200
and somehow play with it

609
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,840
modding it into some higher price

610
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,919
right and actually indeed some of the

611
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,000
content schemes are designed for this

612
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,880
purpose homomorphic

613
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,120
so in this way

614
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,240
yeah the cat will take the watch away

615
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,240
after thinking for a little while the

616
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,320
auctioneer said okay this makes sense do

617
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,240
you have any suggestions because we care

618
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,320
about customer security

619
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,159
it says okay it's simple just use

620
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,120
non-medical condiment

621
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,000
and the auctioneer eventually agreed to

622
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,640
adapt this strategy

623
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,279
here comes the div auction

624
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,200
every party make their commitment using

625
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,320
the nominable equipment scheme

626
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,799
however surprisingly

627
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,360
when the ticket phase happens alice

628
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,799
realized that

629
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,120
the cat is performing exactly the same

630
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,080
attack

631
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,640
so what's happening here

632
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,559
eventually this cat taking this water

633
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,919
away

634
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,880
and he tells that is happily that

635
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,279
surprising that is right

636
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,120
you aren't the only one who gets into

637
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,480
christmas papers

638
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,799
you know who i am i'm actually shouting

639
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,840
this cat

640
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,679
and that crazy guy has performed

641
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,159
thousands of experiments on me

642
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,640
at this moment i want to pause and to

643
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,880
give you a warn because

644
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,039
all of us love cats so

645
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,120
this kind of experiments should remain

646
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,200
mental experience forever

647
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,480
let's continue

648
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,880
after those experiments like i said

649
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,679
eventually i can quantum power

650
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,840
quantum media it's uh beyond your

651
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,120
imagination

652
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,320
okay

653
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,919
so when i was preparing this lesson i'm

654
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,799
not sure if cad woman counts but if you

655
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,120
don't like that you can imagine the

656
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,799
amplitude for this term is zero

657
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,559
so let me tell you what's happening on

658
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,240
the day of auction

659
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,880
actually on that day the same auction is

660
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,120
happening in multi-universe

661
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,000
and i inter i intercept your commitment

662
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,840
and with the help of my colleagues in

663
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,000
the multiple universities i managed to

664
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,960
perform the same attack

665
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,240
so learn your lesson that is classical

666
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,559
nominal commitment may not be nominable

667
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,840
anymore in the quran

668
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,520
setting you can see that alice is pretty

669
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,080
upset and sitting there alone crying

670
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,600
wondering what he could what she could

671
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,320
do

672
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,880
and we all know at least

673
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,320
some good friends

674
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,159
and

675
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,279
the

676
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,080
met header says sorry is we are late but

677
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,080
we eventually get quantumly secure

678
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,559
nominal commands

679
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,640
that sounds interesting however i don't

680
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,200
have quantum power

681
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,360
that's totally fine to join our protocol

682
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,679
on parties can be classical

683
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,520
this is what we call post quantum

684
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,559
protocol

685
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,440
says the wet queen

686
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,640
and

687
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,360
is not convinced yet she said but

688
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,360
auctioneer also cares about interaction

689
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,640
complexity

690
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,320
let's also find our protocol is

691
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,520
constantly wrong

692
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,080
that's a red queen

693
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,320
then what about assumptions if you go as

694
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,000
crazy as io

695
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,600
i don't think the auctioneer will bite

696
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,520
fortunately

697
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,360
we only need the minimal assumption of

698
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,600
white functions of course post quantum y

699
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,080
functions

700
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,919
but action already happen

701
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,640
i can i can do nothing but it

702
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,520
here comes time and he says

703
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,919
hey i'm time i can't revenue back to the

704
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,760
beginning with auction so you can finish

705
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,240
the auction using these post quantum

706
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
number convents

707
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,440
eventually

708
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,360
they get address shared off

709
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,480
and as euro for fair retails a happy

710
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,200
ending is where you stop

711
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,320
and i

712
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,080
i know that there are some parents in

713
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,600
the audience so i want to share this

714
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,120
sentence with you if you happen to have

715
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,200
a daughter

716
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,039
if you want to give her a gift there's

717
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,960
nothing better than asking her to do

718
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,760
quantum cryptography

719
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,840
if you are interested in

720
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,440
how ellie's friends

721
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,840
helped her to obtain this post quantum

722
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,000
nominal equipment you can find more

723
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,080
information at this link

724
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,399
finally i have a quiz for you

725
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,279
and

726
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,200
if you happen to know the answer go find

727
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,960
on-cam

728
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,240
that's all i want to share thank you

729
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,320
hey everybody we're going to take

730
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,600
another break now a quick one we're

731
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,959
going to come back at 9 30.

732
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,559
let's clap again for all the speakers in

733
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,279
this session
