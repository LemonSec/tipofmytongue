1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,639
all right um welcome to the inviting

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,720
session of krypta uh thank you again

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,240
it's great to see everybody alive so

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,360
we're a little bit um behind time so um

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,719
um i'll introduce our uh invited speaker

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,840
and uh

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,720
uh he really needs uh no introduction uh

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,840
but i'll still give one um so many of

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,760
you probably know uh a lot of great

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,400
facts about you the lindell um from

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,880
baralana university and now and unbound

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,599
and coinbase um i'll start with the fact

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,479
that you probably don't know i first met

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,120
you in the early i guess 2000's we were

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,719
both visiting ibm and at that time i was

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,360
known as pretty theoretical and i

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,280
thought it's hard to find somebody who

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,360
is more theoretical than me and then i

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,879
met yuda and

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,239
at that time he was working on

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,879
theoretical foundations of fake and

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,360
uh you know you know clarifying you see

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
definitions a lot of like definitional

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,719
subtleties and things so i said okay

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,800
finally we found somebody who is really

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,559
theoretical and at that time i made a

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,879
lot of predictions uh none of them

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,280
written down i said okay probably uh he

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,200
would be a great politicians he would

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,920
write a lot of influential papers uh on

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,600
theoretical foundation cryptography but

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,760
also i kind of assume that you probably

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,280
never write a paper at an applied

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,320
conference let alone found the company

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,920
or do a lot of

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,320
great applied things and

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,560
as you can see half of my predictions

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,240
were correct and half of my predictions

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,240
were wrong so he has done amazing work

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,320
both as a theoretical cryptographer but

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,560
also as an applied cryptographer and

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,759
also

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,400
as a practitioner as a person who brings

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,479
also an educational fronts and so on so

45
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,759
i'll just leave some of you this

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,360
contribution so

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,360
um he uh

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,000
well uh he is a fellow of the scr so his

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,439
citation is for fundamental

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,119
contributions to theory and practice of

51
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,280
secure multi-party computation for

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200
sustain educational leaderships and for

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,759
the service to the acr but as i said it

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,600
doesn't list a lot of his contributions

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,320
he

56
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,719
um he has written uh

57
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,399
uh you know

58
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,479
you know several books but most not real

59
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,318
book with jonathan katzen introduction

60
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,280
to cryptography which is used in many uh

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,080
for you know um in maine universities as

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,280
a textbook in cryptography um he

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,120
uh

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
you know started baralan school you know

65
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,520
winter school again a lot of educational

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,440
activities he created

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,280
a lot of amazing students

68
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,560
um

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,280
but also i mean he won best paper awards

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,560
and ccs 2016 2017

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,720
he has a test of time at work i think

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,680
this year eurocrypto

73
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
his work on

74
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,519
a secure computation uh

75
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,160
uh but uh also he uh co-authored uh itf

76
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,599
standard on uh aes gcm sav mode of

77
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,440
operation which is also very influential

78
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,319
and practical um well

79
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,159
last but not the least of course he's

80
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,920
also uh

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,200
became a really really applied

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,040
cryptographer with main real world

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,480
contributions but

84
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,920
in addition to working as industry

85
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,080
consultant

86
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,000
for several uh

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,360
for safe network for over 10 years he in

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,239
2014 started became a chief scientist of

89
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,640
unbound and then later became seo from

90
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,239
bound and recently i guess unbound was

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,480
acquired of coinbase and in this talk

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,319
you they will tell us this exciting

93
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,480
journey from theory to practice and back

94
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,640
thank you

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,319
thank you uh very much for your uh uh

96
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,680
very kind words

97
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,280
so i want to talk uh today about uh a

98
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
journey that i had no expectation that

99
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,400
would happen

100
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,879
uh those 20 plus years ago that evgeny

101
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,599
mentioned revealing our age

102
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,480
from theoretical foundations

103
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,319
and it's there's a scientific journey

104
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,760
and there's also a business journey and

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,959
i'll try to cover all of that and

106
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,200
hopefully give insights that

107
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,360
will be of relevance and and of interest

108
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,480
as well

109
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,879
so i want to talk about two really two

110
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,400
separate areas one is the stages of

111
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,120
the scientific evolution of mpc

112
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,879
and what we can learn from it and then

113
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,880
what what our challenges are in

114
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,639
commercialization what challenges we

115
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,199
faced how did we overcome some of them

116
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,360
and what still remains a little bit at

117
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
the end one thing i just want to start

118
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,759
with is i wanted to see look at the

119
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,479
growth of mpc over the years this is uh

120
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,120
very much not exact science but i

121
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,000
put in some main keywords into eprint

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,800
and you can see really that an npc began

123
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,880
in the mid mid 1980s so you could see

124
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,639
that the first 20 or so years quite flat

125
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,400
but a lot of really foundational very

126
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,680
important work

127
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,160
and at least in in the way i view it

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,000
that's what enabled that massive growth

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,440
that came that came afterwards and now

130
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,160
as someone told me a couple of years ago

131
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,720
npc is a buzzword and that's a very big

132
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
change from the time when nobody outside

133
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,280
of this room knew what mpc was uh i

134
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
actually responded to them that i'm not

135
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,600
sure if that's a compliment or an insult

136
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,440
but either way that's the

137
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,520
situation that npc now is somewhat even

138
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,720
a buzzword

139
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
so in terms of scientific evolution i

140
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,120
want to talk about four stages an

141
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,600
initial idea stage the theoretical

142
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,880
foundations

143
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,479
what i call algorithmic research and

144
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,320
then applied research and they're

145
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,759
actually in my mind they're very very

146
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,280
different and you can see basic uh

147
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,919
timeline there but it of course it's

148
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,160
it's not true at all and and things

149
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,400
overlap and they go back and forth and

150
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,720
and all of these uh stages are still

151
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,960
going on simultaneously but there is

152
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
something about these different stages

153
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,479
that lead to each other which i think is

154
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,960
significant a couple of things there are

155
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,680
some many major counter examples like

156
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,000
threshold cryptography which was

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,319
studied intensively in the 1990s also

158
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,319
from efficiency perspective

159
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,880
so it's not an exact science i was ceo

160
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
for three years so i can wave hands and

161
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,360
not talk uh

162
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,600
exact things and feel fine about it and

163
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,639
the second thing is that uh um

164
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,960
there is so there are so many works to

165
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,400
cite and there are so many people who

166
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,639
contributed to this uh

167
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,039
to this process that i'm not going to

168
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,600
cite anyone that way i i'll make sure

169
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,160
that i won't uh leave anyone out at

170
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,440
least i hope so okay so

171
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,160
the initial stage the idea stage

172
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
there's this amazing concept that we can

173
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,400
take

174
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,520
distinct parties communicating remotely

175
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,440
and we can actually compute on private

176
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,039
data without revealing anything but the

177
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,440
result it's an amazing idea

178
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,759
completely counterintuitive

179
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,680
and we can prove basic feasibility that

180
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,960
we can actually do anything any any uh

181
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,560
function that you can compute locally

182
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,240
you can actually compute in this

183
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,479
distributed and private manner

184
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,759
and not only can you you can do it

185
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,280
computationally you can even do it

186
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,720
information theoretically if you have

187
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,880
secure channels and you can do crazy

188
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,520
things like oblivious transfer i can

189
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,199
choose what message to get without you

190
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,199
knowing what i chose with the only only

191
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,800
getting one and you can do something

192
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,919
even more amazing which is ot extension

193
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,800
i can do a number of asymmetric

194
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,479
oblivious transfers are expensive and

195
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,479
then with only symmetric operations i

196
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,560
can do many many many more

197
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,759
these are incredible ideas

198
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,599
multiplication triples if i'm able to

199
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,240
generate offline triples

200
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,479
secret sharing of triples a b and c

201
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,400
where c equals a times b

202
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,240
i can now very very quickly compute a

203
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,479
circuit and do online mpc really really

204
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,759
fast

205
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,680
we can use polynomial secret sharing and

206
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
multiply polynomials together and do

207
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,960
degree reduction

208
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
gobble circuits of course we can we can

209
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,160
compile protocols where the adversary is

210
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,879
rather mild and benign semi honest into

211
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,280
malicious this is an incredible time

212
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,919
with with amazing ideas

213
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,120
that um show us the incredible potential

214
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,759
of this idea called mpc and that i think

215
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,599
is like the first decade of course there

216
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,720
are many amazing ideas afterwards um but

217
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,360
but there is a real concentration of

218
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,599
these ideas at this time and this list

219
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,280
actually has another interesting aspect

220
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,440
that i'll get to a bit later on and and

221
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,720
there are many other ideas at this time

222
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,639
but this specific list

223
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,479
all of these things are very much in use

224
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,160
in practice today and i'll come back to

225
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,000
that a little bit later on

226
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,039
so um what's really

227
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,560
quite interesting when you think about

228
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
it is that these ideas all came about

229
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,360
before we even knew how to define

230
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,080
security yes people in the early 90s

231
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,279
were defining security there were

232
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,958
certainly definitions

233
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,440
but most of those definitions

234
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,000
we're not using any more today and

235
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,159
many of them would look now and say no

236
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,279
we don't really think that's a

237
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,600
sufficient or a good enough definition

238
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,760
but yet these ideas

239
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,320
already came about at that time and many

240
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,680
of them were just

241
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,760
right the protocols themselves the ideas

242
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,440
were so right that when we came up with

243
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,240
the appropriate definitions later on

244
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
those ideas were actually

245
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,320
all good enough and all followed through

246
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,880
even we had these much more stringent

247
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,800
modern definitions that we're using

248
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,120
today so there was something

249
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,600
about this stage and the people who were

250
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,080
around then and doing this

251
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,640
that they had an amazing intuition

252
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,000
that were able to bring ideas that are

253
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,080
going to be relevant 30 years later even

254
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,959
before we really understood what mpc

255
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,320
actually means from a definitional

256
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,760
perspective

257
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,680
the second observation that i want to

258
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,320
make which i think is

259
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,040
also very very surprising

260
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,360
is that when we think about theoretical

261
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,200
feasibility results and and these

262
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,480
theoretical

263
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,800
uh notions what we're trying to we're

264
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,880
trying to prove a theorem that it's

265
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,240
possible

266
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,560
uh uh that it's feasible that you can

267
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,959
actually do this we're not trying to do

268
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,800
anything practical we're not interested

269
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,480
in that at this stage

270
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,320
yet it turns out that a lot of those

271
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,080
techniques are what we're actually doing

272
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,959
today in practice so yes we've optimized

273
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,200
gobble circuits and we've optimized ot

274
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,600
extension and we generate multiplication

275
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
triples in different ways and so on and

276
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,440
so forth but all of those ideas are

277
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,880
actually what we're using today in

278
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,360
practice and that's really surprising i

279
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,720
don't see any reason why we should

280
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,800
expect that to be the case like i

281
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,640
wouldn't have expected

282
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,880
that uh what people

283
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,640
uh design the way people design

284
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,880
protocols to prove a feasibility result

285
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,560
would actually be the most efficient way

286
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,399
to do things today and that also comes

287
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,000
when you talk about protocols for

288
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,720
specific functions i want to design a

289
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,360
protocol for private set intersection

290
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,920
versus protocols for you know generic

291
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,399
circuits i know boolean or arithmetic

292
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,640
circuits you would think that or at

293
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
least i thought 20 years ago 15 years

294
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,800
ago without a doubt that these generic

295
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
protocols will never be used what we're

296
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,079
interested in is the specific protocols

297
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,800
i want to do ecdsa threshold signing i'm

298
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,920
going to divide and design it

299
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,519
specifically for that i want to do

300
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,880
private intersection i'm going to design

301
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,399
it specifically for that and that's all

302
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,480
actually true but we actually do use

303
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,279
these generic protocols all the time

304
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,640
based on circuits because if i want to

305
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,839
do aes

306
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,519
or hmac

307
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,680
there is no structure for me to rely on

308
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,760
i actually do use this circuit

309
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,720
transition and also there are many cases

310
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,880
where it's both efficient enough and

311
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,720
more flexible so we're actually using

312
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,959
these generic circuit methods as well

313
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,480
things that 15 or 20 years ago we

314
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,839
thought no that would never actually be

315
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,959
something that we're going to use in

316
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,200
practice so a lot of surprises also in

317
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,279
this idea stage and a really really

318
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,959
amazing flourishing time for the

319
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,959
beginning of npc but at some point we

320
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,880
take a step back and say okay but we

321
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,720
need to understand what really this is

322
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,760
all about we need to define security we

323
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,160
need to talk about uh how powerful our

324
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,920
adversary is what the adversary can do

325
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
and cannot do what are we assuming we

326
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,600
need to learn how to prove security we

327
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
need to develop techniques for how to

328
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,519
prove security and we need to understand

329
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,000
under what assumptions we can or cannot

330
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,079
achieve these different notions so this

331
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,079
is the theoretical foundation stage

332
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,920
where we now we've we've appreciated the

333
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,720
potential of what we can do with mpc but

334
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,079
now we need to take a step back and

335
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,320
understand you know sort of lay the

336
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,399
foundations of the house that was you

337
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,200
know

338
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,279
built very very quickly and maybe with

339
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,600
you know sort of uh plaster walls and

340
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,519
now we want to actually build strong

341
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,600
foundations and build and rebuild the

342
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
house afterwards

343
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,279
and it's important for me to stress and

344
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,200
this is a period that i was around so i

345
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,480
can speak you know firsthand

346
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,560
the motivation was not

347
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,079
using

348
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,160
mpc to solve a problem

349
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,360
and

350
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,880
in fact it was unclear whether it would

351
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,800
ever even be used

352
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,920
whether it would ever be practical

353
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,360
enough to be used

354
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,040
and even if you look at the papers

355
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,200
you'll say no but if i read an npc paper

356
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,079
from

357
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,480
1999 it says in the introduction and

358
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,959
gives me practical motivation no but

359
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,560
that wasn't the point the point of the

360
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,320
practical motivation in those papers is

361
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,360
to say here is a natural and interesting

362
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,200
question that we'd like to solve and you

363
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,880
can see that in the real world it maps

364
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,120
to things that people are interested in

365
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,200
it doesn't mean that because we wrote in

366
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,040
the beginning of the paper here you can

367
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,519
you know design an mpc protocol to learn

368
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,040
a decision tree and you could use that

369
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
to solve some medical problem it wasn't

370
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,920
that we're actually thinking about

371
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,760
solving a medical problem because at

372
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,680
that time these things could never even

373
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
be run in any way shape or form so why

374
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,320
did we study it and the answer is simply

375
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,079
because it's about understanding our

376
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,200
world and that's what theoretical

377
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
research is and if our world has

378
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,839
computation in it then in the same way

379
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,880
that uh physicists study

380
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,680
physics in order to understand our world

381
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,920
then computer scientists study computer

382
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,199
science in order to understand our world

383
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,040
because computation is part of it and

384
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,959
these are very elegant and natural

385
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,079
questions

386
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,040
and there is a uh a quote that i'm not

387
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,639
sure exactly what the quote is and who

388
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,560
to attribute it i won't say but the

389
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,880
natural question needs no motivation the

390
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,959
ability to prove

391
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,519
a statement without revealing anything

392
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,760
except that it's true is incredible

393
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,160
notion i don't need a practical

394
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,639
application to zero knowledge proofs in

395
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,560
order for it to make it worthy of study

396
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
and indeed we didn't care about practice

397
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,000
about there being a practical

398
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,920
application these were just natural

399
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,360
questions to study and we were doing

400
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,320
science

401
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,399
and when you do science as a community

402
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,160
good things happen and that's very much

403
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
the story of npc

404
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,880
so

405
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,839
um

406
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,160
in my mind and certainly as i started as

407
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,639
a pure theoretician but still see myself

408
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,720
as belonging to the the community even

409
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,240
i'm not sure maybe they've thrown me out

410
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,440
now um there are many benefits of

411
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,600
theoretical research

412
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,279
understanding our world as i mentioned

413
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,920
the techniques and the knowledge that we

414
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,560
are obtained through that study is very

415
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,040
beneficial even just personally you can

416
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,199
actually be a consultant

417
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,720
uh as a theoretical cryptographer

418
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,240
because you have an adversarial mindset

419
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,160
when you come to look at something

420
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,240
you think about how to break it or if

421
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
you try to prove it where the proof

422
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,680
fails is where you find an attack and

423
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,440
that actually happened to me

424
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,399
in practice in in in one specific uh

425
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,760
consulting

426
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,720
job

427
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,240
so there's something just about the

428
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,320
techniques and the knowledge that we

429
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,399
impart through through theoretical

430
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,079
research which is very beneficial in

431
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,120
practice

432
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,959
but i want to stress i'm talking about

433
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,639
its benefit benefit to practice but i

434
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,639
don't think you need it

435
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,120
it's fine and it's beneficial and it's

436
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,040
good for the world versus just just to

437
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,199
understand the world and that's also

438
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,639
legitimate

439
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,440
but in npc it went much much beyond that

440
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,040
and mpc

441
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,240
became

442
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,800
group brew to a practical field out of

443
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,360
that much of that theoretical research

444
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,199
and npc is not the only example right

445
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,880
google's search algorithm is based on

446
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,519
random walks on on graphs so there are

447
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,279
many examples but npc is certainly one

448
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,000
of those examples

449
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,759
okay so we've had about a decade or so

450
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,000
of this theoretical foundation that's

451
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,160
still ongoing but then we start asking

452
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,079
the question okay here are these amazing

453
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,279
ideas

454
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,480
and we have a good theoretical

455
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,759
understanding

456
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,320
but could this ever actually be used

457
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
could we ever actually

458
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,720
run an npc protocol

459
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,639
implement it and run it and have it

460
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,959
actually do something in reasonable

461
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,440
enough time that it can be useful and

462
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
it's and it's unclear

463
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,199
because the way protocols were designed

464
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,560
then especially if you're looking at

465
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,639
maliciously secure protocols you'd have

466
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,839
to do

467
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,240
absurd things like

468
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,720
do a car production to an mp complete

469
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,279
problem and prove zero knowledge on that

470
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,160
right

471
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,519
i don't think anybody has actually

472
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,279
proven feasibility they can implement a

473
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,519
car production to an mp complete problem

474
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,199
and then run that

475
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,759
or or use multiple asymmetric operations

476
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,639
for every gate in in in a big circuit

477
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,399
these are just absurd things so you

478
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,240
start asking the question well

479
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,959
can can we maybe do this and this is a

480
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,000
very challenging task because you tend

481
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,360
to lose interest from the purists

482
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,839
because the pure theorists say well

483
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,680
okay i know that we can do this i don't

484
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,920
care if it's a little bit more efficient

485
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,199
and the pure

486
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,520
practitioners sometimes say

487
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,959
well you're going from wildly

488
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,839
impractical to wildly impractical with a

489
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,359
little bit better

490
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,039
why is that interesting if it's going to

491
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,119
be enter the five

492
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,799
uh uh

493
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,199
computation or end to the four in either

494
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,000
case it's it's completely impractical

495
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,799
and and in fact uh this was a uh a

496
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,039
difficult time for that reason

497
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,440
fortunately the community did support

498
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,840
but interestingly the community

499
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,200
supported it was much easier to publish

500
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
at that time a paper that was improving

501
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,360
the efficiency of the general circuit

502
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,400
methods than of specific questions which

503
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,559
i don't really have an explanation why

504
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,120
but maybe people felt if you're doing

505
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,480
said intersection

506
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,919
and that's a you know a practical

507
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,360
question with a and you want to be more

508
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,480
efficient than if you're wildly

509
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,559
inefficient it's not interesting but but

510
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,720
there was also a low for mpc at this

511
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,200
time and i remember specifically being

512
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,960
on a program committee

513
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,120
and being very frustrated because you

514
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,720
know there are very there are people who

515
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,039
and many people here who are very broad

516
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,799
in the research they research many many

517
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,559
different things i don't i do one thing

518
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,799
i know one thing and now npc has grown

519
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,480
so much i don't even know that anymore

520
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,280
but um i i do npc that's what i do and

521
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,720
i'm sitting on this program committee

522
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,799
and there's leakage and there's bilinear

523
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,200
maps and zlatan says i don't understand

524
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,640
these i don't know anything about it i

525
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,840
don't understand the math behind the

526
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,840
lattices and the bilinear maps and i'm

527
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,360
trying to find papers you have to vote

528
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,720
for what papers you're able to read and

529
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,640
i'm saying you know i have to like send

530
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,520
to the the program chair that you know

531
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,039
i have hardly any papers that i'm able

532
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,559
to read because i just

533
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,240
don't know

534
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,760
much about all those other things and

535
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,480
npc is is not really very popular at

536
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,760
this time

537
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,919
and i think there's an important lesson

538
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,000
but i i want to be clear about not

539
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,520
taking this too fast so what happens

540
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,840
when your field loses popularity and

541
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,080
people lose interest what do you do

542
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,360
so i don't want to be that person that

543
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,120
says everybody here can be the president

544
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,799
no not everybody can be the president

545
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,400
and not everybody here should just do

546
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,919
what they want to do and ignore the rest

547
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,440
of the world so we can't take it too

548
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,039
extreme but

549
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,520
i really believe that if you're

550
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
passionate about

551
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,799
your field then you should continue

552
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,200
researching what you're passionate about

553
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
so sometimes

554
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,960
you're you're researching something and

555
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,480
it exhausts itself and you really should

556
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,960
leave and sometimes it's a fad and it

557
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,640
goes away and you should go into other

558
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
things but sometimes it's not and

559
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
sometimes you're a lone wolf but if

560
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,720
that's what you enjoy doing that's what

561
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,919
you're passionate about and you do it

562
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,960
well

563
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,559
then it's okay and legitimate to

564
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,240
continue doing that

565
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,360
because firstly it means you'll do

566
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,720
better research

567
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,160
and secondly and this is the more

568
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,520
important thing

569
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,200
what's important is the community not

570
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,600
the individual so whether uh lindelof

571
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,320
has a successful scientific career

572
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,960
is completely unimportant to the world

573
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,880
it just doesn't make any difference

574
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,280
if i have a bad career or a good career

575
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,120
it really doesn't matter nothing in the

576
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,600
world is going to change because of that

577
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,080
but if we believe that our community is

578
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,760
doing important things

579
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,520
and if we believe

580
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,280
that because we have a digital world and

581
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,880
cryptography is really important in a

582
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,480
digital world and

583
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,919
new directions in cryptography that

584
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,240
abstract still resonates today

585
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,640
so if we believe that then the community

586
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,960
succeeding is really important

587
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,760
and therefore an individual who's doing

588
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,000
something different they may succeed or

589
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,240
they may fail but having multiple

590
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
individuals doing different things means

591
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
that as a community we have a much

592
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,720
bigger chance of succeeding so it's okay

593
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,240
to be different and it's okay to do

594
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,000
something which is unpopular sometimes

595
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,360
you have to check yourself maybe you

596
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,280
really you know it has exhausted itself

597
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,960
and you should leave but the fact that

598
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,559
other people are doing different things

599
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,080
doesn't mean that what you're doing is

600
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,159
the wrong thing and if it is the wrong

601
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,480
thing it's also fine because in order

602
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,679
for us to succeed in the community we

603
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,120
need to have people doing the wrong

604
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,840
thing some or even a lot of the time so

605
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
i think that's an important lesson that

606
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,000
that we can also take away

607
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,760
after we have the algorithmic stage we

608
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
have the applied research stage and and

609
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,360
here's a difference

610
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,600
in both of these stages where

611
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,280
make on a second journey skip the

612
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,158
algorithmic stage

613
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,480
oh no i didn't skip the algorithm should

614
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,320
i talk about that yeah so now in the

615
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,480
applied research stage

616
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,039
um

617
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,720
the the you're still working on making

618
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,919
something more efficient but there's a

619
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,159
fundamental difference

620
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,640
in the algorithmic stage the focus is on

621
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,000
the mpc

622
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,520
i want to make

623
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,080
my uh mpc protocol my cryptographic

624
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,840
protocol i want to make it better i want

625
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,000
to introduce new techniques i want to do

626
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,480
new things in the applied research stage

627
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,360
the focus is no longer on the techniques

628
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,559
but on the problem that i want to solve

629
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,360
so if you look at a paper in 2001

630
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,200
that's called privacy preserving data

631
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,559
mining and shows how you can do

632
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,720
two-party secure computation semi-honest

633
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,039
of decision tree learning and if you

634
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,000
look in 2021 i'm just use that number to

635
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,360
be 20 years later

636
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,679
at people doing

637
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,600
privacy preserving machine learning

638
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,039
they're completely different papers but

639
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,200
if you read the introduction it's a bit

640
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,400
subtle

641
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,559
because in 2001 although it's talking

642
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,400
about privacy preserving machine

643
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,360
learning

644
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,080
it's the statement of the paper is

645
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,320
mpc has the potential to actually solve

646
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,799
these types of more complex problems

647
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,240
but no one really cares about the

648
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,280
problem

649
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,520
we're not trying to do decision tree

650
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,320
learning in practice in 2021 we actually

651
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,039
are

652
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,120
we want to solve a real problem and the

653
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,760
npc becomes a tool to solve that problem

654
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,360
and the focus is actually on solving the

655
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,720
problem not only aren't not on the

656
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,200
cryptographic uh core

657
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,000
but even of course we do that we

658
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,400
do do new cryptography and we do add new

659
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,559
techniques but the focus is very very

660
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,919
different and that's why i differentiate

661
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,679
between the algorithmic research type

662
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,000
papers or stage and the applied research

663
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,600
i think they're very different

664
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,520
and and of course all of this mixes up

665
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,640
because then you get nice new

666
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,760
theoretical questions when you're

667
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,600
studying these these problems as well

668
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,080
and and everything interacts uh very

669
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,520
very nicely

670
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,679
but at some point we've done all of this

671
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,799
work

672
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,120
and the science becomes what we call

673
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,039
technology and becomes something we can

674
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,280
actually apply and practice

675
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,320
and

676
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,400
um and then what do we do it's actually

677
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,559
ready for commercialization and the

678
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,640
tendency of many researchers and

679
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,799
including very much myself

680
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,880
is to wave to industry and say hello

681
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
look over here look we have this

682
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,919
wonderful

683
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,080
wonderful thing that we've built take it

684
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,440
you can solve lots of really good

685
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,799
problems go

686
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,240
use it

687
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,840
it's really nice but it's never going to

688
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,280
happen and the reason why it's not going

689
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,880
to happen there are two reasons why two

690
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,400
reasons why it's not going to happen the

691
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,600
first reason why it's not going to

692
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,480
happen

693
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,679
is because they actually don't know

694
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,960
about it

695
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,880
so maybe we can try to be better at

696
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,559
communicating and maybe we should write

697
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,400
more in scientific american or maybe we

698
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,640
should try to write more popular science

699
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,080
but but people in industry just don't

700
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,039
know about it they're not going to know

701
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,400
about it

702
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,279
but the more fundament the deeper reason

703
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,159
or or the more acute reason

704
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,320
is that in the early stages of

705
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,080
commercialization

706
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,200
these scientific tools require huge

707
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,279
expertise to deploy

708
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,559
so we all know that deploying

709
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,279
cryptography is hard anyway

710
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,360
getting someone to encrypt with aes

711
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,480
properly

712
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,880
is hard but if you've taken an undergrad

713
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,159
course in cryptography there's a good

714
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,840
chance you'll be able to do it

715
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,919
you don't need more than that

716
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,600
but um

717
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,520
but with npc it's far from it especially

718
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,960
in the early commercialization stage and

719
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,120
even today as well it's far from that it

720
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,799
needs great expertise if we're not

721
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,240
willing to do that

722
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,919
it's not going to happen people in

723
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,600
industry are not able to even even if

724
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,159
they wanted to if they knew about it

725
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,760
they're just not able to come and take

726
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,520
it and to start using it themselves

727
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,919
without us being involved now some

728
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,240
reaches researchers actively look to do

729
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,880
it they want to have a startup for many

730
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,080
years people would say we thought you

731
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,520
researched don't you have any startup

732
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,120
you want to do and say leave me alone

733
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,200
i'm a happy academic i like doing

734
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,400
research

735
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,840
i i like my life i'm not interested

736
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,240
that sort of

737
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,000
went away at some point because i had an

738
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,880
idea that i felt i couldn't ignore

739
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,159
the idea was a very simple one which was

740
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,320
that if we can split keys it's the

741
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
threshold signing or threshold

742
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,080
cryptography idea but in a more modern

743
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,760
perspective if we can split keys into

744
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,120
multiple places and have strong

745
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,679
separation between those pieces

746
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,080
then we can protect keys in software and

747
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,919
have many many advantages over what's

748
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,520
currently done in the world to protect

749
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,120
keys

750
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,799
i felt i couldn't ignore it also was

751
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,200
somewhat a natural progression if i

752
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,039
started doing pure theory and then was

753
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,640
involved in algorithmic research and

754
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,080
then in applied research this was sort

755
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,640
of like a natural progression it also

756
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,480
takes a lot of commitment luckily i

757
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,120
didn't know how much because otherwise

758
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,880
very possible i wouldn't have even ever

759
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,200
started but it doesn't matter

760
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,960
uh i

761
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,080
like what i talked about before and for

762
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,720
the community not everybody has to do it

763
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,400
um and it's good for the people who want

764
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,159
to do it to be the ones who do it but

765
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,440
the fact we have some people doing it

766
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,360
and some people not doing it

767
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,880
means that we get this healthy community

768
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,080
where different people are doing

769
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,679
different things and then as a community

770
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,559
again

771
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,919
we succeed

772
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,360
so what are some of the challenges of

773
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,640
the early days

774
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,679
well

775
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,600
what is npc

776
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,279
it sounds like snake oil because it

777
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,360
doesn't really sound possible unless you

778
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,760
had people we had one meeting and

779
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,600
someone from our i think was oracle said

780
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,919
that he just doesn't believe us

781
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,919
like you're lying it just doesn't make

782
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,559
any sense this is not called go away

783
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,440
um

784
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,960
many of the people just never heard of

785
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,039
it they just never ever heard of these

786
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,039
things you're doing something brand new

787
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,039
with something that i've never heard of

788
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,240
um what

789
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
you know is it legitimate

790
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
it's a real problem so so what do you do

791
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,159
how do you overcome this

792
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,120
so actually to my great surprise

793
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,520
academic reputation actually helps

794
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,679
so writing a textbook actually probably

795
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,600
helped my company a lot more than many

796
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,440
many other things that i did because

797
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,200
there were these multiple times you're

798
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,480
in a meeting you're meeting with

799
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,039
business people and technical people and

800
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,440
someone one of those people uh one of

801
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,039
those uh

802
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,200
people on the technical side studied

803
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,880
cryptography in university and used your

804
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,679
book

805
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,120
and suddenly it's a different completely

806
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,279
different discussion because you have

807
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,279
credibility or people can look you up

808
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,720
and see that you

809
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,799
you published many papers you're a

810
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,880
serious researcher and and therefore we

811
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,880
should listen to you and not immediately

812
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,399
dismiss you as another obvious snake oil

813
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,919
sales person

814
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,120
this also means that it's really

815
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,360
important to keep that reputation so

816
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,039
when the marketing people in my company

817
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,240
said we would like your linkedin

818
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,480
credentials so we can post for you i

819
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,520
said no

820
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,240
not happening never never ever

821
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,960
market education we need to educate the

822
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,880
market about this new new thing that

823
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,559
we're doing and that means that when

824
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,720
you're building a startup base which is

825
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
based on new technology or deep

826
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,600
technology it's going to take longer

827
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,120
it's going to take a long time and in

828
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,480
fact

829
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,240
if people know this but the average the

830
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,559
median time to exit and exit i mean or

831
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,120
acquisition or ipo the meaning time to

832
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
to exit for a startup company is eight

833
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,640
years

834
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,559
so when you're building a startup based

835
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,080
on

836
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,000
deep technology can you can expect for

837
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
it to take longer in our case it ended

838
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,080
up taking seven years so just below but

839
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,520
but it makes sense that it takes longer

840
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,600
because the initial years are you have

841
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,760
to do a lot of market education that's

842
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
speaking and writing blogs and writing

843
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,360
white papers and communicating with the

844
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,320
community and and when you're involved

845
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,960
you you involve customers and and you

846
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,120
have people at that customer who become

847
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,200
aware they move around that's also why

848
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,880
you very much in a startup company try

849
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,480
to have focus in a specific what they

850
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,960
call a vertical an industry because

851
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,799
people move around in that industry so

852
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,399
you've educated one person in one place

853
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,159
they move to another company now you

854
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,360
suddenly have another company who's

855
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,120
aware of what you're doing and so on and

856
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,480
so forth

857
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,360
a fip certification it's actually really

858
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,720
really important

859
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,480
it helped us a huge amount we had a a

860
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,320
customer over a million dollar a year

861
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,279
customer

862
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,760
who we said we're getting fips like in

863
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,520
in a couple of you know very soon a

864
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,440
month or two we're getting at uh so you

865
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,360
know and that was really significant

866
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,640
especially because we had level two and

867
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,080
not just level one

868
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,760
but they withheld the second half of the

869
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,679
payment they paid half and the second

870
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,960
half they wouldn't pay until we got the

871
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,640
certification

872
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,480
so this actually is an important signal

873
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
for the industry and people in in this

874
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
room and myself in the past they admit

875
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,559
as well would say well you know

876
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,240
how how serious really is food

877
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,760
certification i mean if you have you

878
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,360
know bugs in the software it's not going

879
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,440
to catch it it's you know are these

880
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,799
things really important the answer is

881
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,279
actually they are because there's a lot

882
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,720
of noise out there how does a customer

883
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,960
who wants to buy a cryptographic product

884
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,720
know that they're not buying complete

885
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,320
and utter garbage

886
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,720
it's very very challenging at least if

887
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,679
they know

888
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,600
that you're using standard cryptography

889
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,000
and standard methods and it's undergone

890
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,039
some uh some significant or real

891
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,960
scrutiny that helps them a lot in making

892
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,240
that decision

893
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
uh in unbound was very important for us

894
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,799
to support the entire cryptographic api

895
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,080
the standard one so we did mpc for ecdsa

896
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,360
rsa

897
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,159
uh um aes with the different standard

898
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,000
modes of encryption hmac and so on and

899
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
so forth because we it was really

900
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,720
important we're just supporting the

901
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,120
standard crypto cryptographic api

902
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,640
and then we can get fip certification

903
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,080
for that and that was very significant

904
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,000
for our customers

905
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,720
um the nist people here afterwards those

906
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,919
i can take a few envelopes

907
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,320
there's something else gartner garner is

908
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,240
like these market analysts that they

909
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,600
look at the world and they look at

910
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,840
different technologies and companies and

911
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,159
they actually also really help a lot but

912
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,919
this really grates you in the beginning

913
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,440
it's like really outrageous like we have

914
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,240
thousands of scientific papers published

915
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,880
in top conferences and journals and what

916
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,720
you want is this

917
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,399
gartner analyst to come and tell you

918
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,960
that npc is a legitimate thing i mean

919
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,519
really but again you have to understand

920
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,679
the world is a very noisy world there's

921
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,720
a lot of fake news a lot of vendors

922
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,600
selling

923
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,519
complete garbage

924
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,960
lying through the teeth about what

925
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,159
they're doing

926
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,039
and

927
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,960
people need things to help them clear up

928
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,799
that noise and gartner is one of those

929
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,320
things i have this thing called a hype

930
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,240
cycle and when i talk about different

931
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,919
technologies i won't go into it but

932
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,279
actually this turns out to also be

933
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,840
something very important to engage in

934
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,519
those analysts

935
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,200
as part of your market education because

936
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,960
they help a lot

937
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,120
okay so now you've we we've decided

938
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,559
we're going to do this

939
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,519
um we have the technology and we have to

940
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,240
decide what problems are we solving

941
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,039
and and here there's a very challenging

942
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,519
first step which is to move from doing

943
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,320
projects to building products

944
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,159
today and there are companies that are

945
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,200
doing this

946
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,360
uh you can build a successful consulting

947
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,000
company building one-off solutions

948
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,039
projects for a with mpc for different

949
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,960
people who need different things

950
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,720
but you can't scale in that way you

951
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,279
can't build a viable scalable business

952
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,960
where you build one piece of software

953
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,200
and sell it to many many companies and

954
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,519
get that exponential growth and i'm

955
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,640
still enough for the scientists when i

956
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,760
say experience actually mean that i

957
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,600
don't mean a lot like other people use

958
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,360
it it's actually doubling each year for

959
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,519
five five years or something like that

960
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,440
you can't do that without a scalable

961
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,480
product

962
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,240
and that means that you need to find

963
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,720
something that many many people want

964
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,960
now um

965
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,480
our focus at unbound was on key

966
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,360
management and and and key protection

967
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,880
and the advantage of that is this is an

968
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,720
existing problem with existing budget

969
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,840
and people understand they need

970
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,000
solutions for that they don't understand

971
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,840
they need hours but they need solutions

972
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,039
for that

973
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,960
when you're going to even new areas like

974
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,159
privacy

975
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,640
using npc to solve privacy this is

976
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,039
really uncharted waters and it takes

977
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,799
time to find

978
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,480
problems that many many different

979
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,880
customers have and you have to be

980
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,240
careful not to be fooled by your first

981
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,440
one or two customers because they can

982
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,799
actually be the exception and not the

983
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:01,600
rule

984
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,519
so finding something that a problem that

985
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,120
many people want to solve is a really

986
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,279
really critical thing to do and also

987
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,799
finding what we call a repeatable use

988
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,399
case something that again many people

989
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,399
are going to use the same thing

990
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,159
and we often get confused what is a use

991
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,480
case and we think oh cryptographic key

992
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,640
protection no that's not a use case

993
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,480
cryptographic key protection is an

994
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,200
application but what am i protecting or

995
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,399
better machine learning for image

996
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,840
analysis that's not a use case that's

997
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,039
technology a use case is replacing smart

998
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,799
cards

999
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,720
for user authentication by using npc

1000
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,840
between a mobile mobile and a server

1001
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,679
or using an mpc for or you know using

1002
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,080
key protection for code signing that's

1003
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,360
an application

1004
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,960
let's say sorry that's a use case and

1005
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
you need many people with the same use

1006
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,840
case in order to again grow that viable

1007
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,360
uh business

1008
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
and when you have repeatability you

1009
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,279
understand what problem your customers

1010
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,960
are trying to solve you can

1011
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,080
market to them you can train your sales

1012
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,440
people

1013
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,120
about the specific application people

1014
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,200
are interested in you can educate the

1015
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
market because you know who you're

1016
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,719
talking to because you know what

1017
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,639
problems they're trying to solve these

1018
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,399
are all very very difficult problems to

1019
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,679
solve

1020
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,280
and often what happens especially in the

1021
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,000
early days is that we fall into the trap

1022
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,199
and mistake

1023
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,199
of talking about technology it's very

1024
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,079
natural for us because we're

1025
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,839
technologists we love technology and

1026
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,918
often we don't like business that much

1027
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:26,800
so

1028
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,960
we talk about the technology

1029
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,199
but it's really important to understand

1030
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,399
that a company with the best technology

1031
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,800
but poor business execution

1032
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,199
will lose to companies that have poor

1033
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,000
technology and better business execution

1034
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,760
it's not good enough to have good

1035
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,119
technology

1036
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,879
and in fact

1037
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,199
uh it's really important to get to a

1038
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,199
stage where you're not talking about the

1039
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,280
technology anymore the technology is a

1040
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,440
means to an end

1041
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,920
the end is to solve a problem a business

1042
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,000
problem that your customers have your

1043
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,079
technology is the way that you do it but

1044
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,200
no one cares about your technology

1045
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,800
or if they do care then you should be

1046
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,200
very careful and wary because that means

1047
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,400
that there are technologies who are

1048
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,760
going to say this is really cool but

1049
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,000
you'll never sell an actual product to

1050
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,880
them

1051
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,800
okay so

1052
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,119
the reason why this is hard for us is

1053
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,839
because what makes our product better

1054
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,839
the technology so if we don't talk about

1055
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,079
the technology then what differentiates

1056
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,160
us from our customers

1057
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,599
and that tendency actually it takes it

1058
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,160
really requires a lot of training and

1059
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,560
understanding about again what business

1060
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,400
problem we're solving to get move away

1061
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,520
from the stage of talking about

1062
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,960
technology

1063
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,640
and here as cryptographers we have a

1064
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,680
problem

1065
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,520
because most of our solutions are

1066
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,960
invisible

1067
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,640
if i'm selling anomaly detection what i

1068
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,200
do is i walk into my customer and i say

1069
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,040
i'm potential customers say listen i run

1070
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,720
a scan on your network and let me see

1071
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,359
what and what malware i catch that your

1072
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,720
existing systems don't i haven't caught

1073
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,160
and i can do that i can actually

1074
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,480
demonstrate clearly that i'm doing

1075
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,520
something

1076
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,680
that uh or that i'm better than what you

1077
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,720
have now

1078
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,880
what i'm encrypting in one way or

1079
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,760
another providing privacy i'm preventing

1080
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,720
i'm claiming i can prevent somebody from

1081
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,640
carrying out an attack

1082
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,960
how much is that actually worse

1083
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,800
people want to understand what they call

1084
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,040
the roi the return on investment i'm i'm

1085
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,480
gonna buy a product for two hundred

1086
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,880
thousand dollars i want to understand

1087
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,640
how much is that actually

1088
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,640
is that going to be worthwhile for me

1089
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,240
because security is in many cases

1090
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,680
not in all cases not in national

1091
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,839
security but in in business world it's

1092
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,240
interesting as long as it saves me money

1093
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,520
and if i can improve security of credit

1094
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,000
cards but the amount that it will cost

1095
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,400
is more than i lose every year on fraud

1096
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
then it's not worth my while as a credit

1097
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,920
card company i don't care if people

1098
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,520
steal 10 million dollars for me as i'm

1099
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,440
long as long as i'm making

1100
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,640
uh uh

1101
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,480
you know enough more than that that i

1102
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,119
still have my my my profit margin

1103
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,880
but when you're doing again cryptography

1104
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,800
it's very hard to put your finger on

1105
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,119
actually how much is this worth

1106
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,240
and being

1107
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,359
secure and unclear and being more secure

1108
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,839
doesn't really say very much and it's

1109
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,119
very hard for people to actually

1110
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,960
understand if they should buy or not

1111
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,280
so how do we overcome this challenge and

1112
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,800
there are a number of things but two

1113
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,720
main things i want to focus on is one is

1114
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,760
finding what you call your value

1115
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,400
proposition so what actual value is my

1116
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,480
product bringing to my customers

1117
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,640
and again as you can guess saying you're

1118
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,280
more secure in some vague way

1119
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,520
is going to be difficult

1120
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
not for everyone some customers will buy

1121
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,599
based on it being better security

1122
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,119
but

1123
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,599
at scale much harder and the second is

1124
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,960
determining what we call the compelling

1125
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,480
event the compelling event is if you

1126
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,720
want to buy something

1127
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,800
what makes me buy it now

1128
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,640
okay so your kid yelling in the store

1129
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,480
that they want this right now maybe it's

1130
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,720
a compelling event as a parent but as a

1131
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,200
business i have to understand like okay

1132
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,119
so this this this thing we had many

1133
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,720
times this is really cool technology

1134
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,119
this is much better than we use now this

1135
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,760
is much better than our physical hsms uh

1136
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,200
i love this product

1137
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,400
but

1138
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,560
why should i buy it right now

1139
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,880
they don't say that but they don't buy

1140
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,480
and you don't really understand why and

1141
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,520
the reason is there's no compelling

1142
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
event there's nothing forcing them to

1143
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,040
buy it right now so it gets pushed off

1144
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,240
as a project this is something you put

1145
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,920
on the side is a great thing to do it's

1146
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,520
like those papers that you always wanted

1147
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,839
to read

1148
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,599
okay so in terms of value proposition

1149
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,200
for us at unbound it was very much

1150
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,880
actually not what we thought

1151
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,440
we started with okay we have physical

1152
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,520
hsms hardware security modules and there

1153
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,880
are smart cards

1154
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,480
hardware is a pain

1155
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,240
most of our hope their you know if

1156
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,839
they're hsn vendors here please don't

1157
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,400
hate me but most people hate their hsms

1158
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,960
and we said okay so if we

1159
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,240
do this in software it's going to be

1160
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,000
cheaper it's going to be faster deploy

1161
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,320
more agile

1162
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,160
so that's that's our that's our value

1163
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,839
proposition it didn't actually really

1164
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,440
work very well

1165
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,280
because it wasn't enough and there was

1166
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,800
no compelling event

1167
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,880
just by being you know i already have

1168
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,240
the hardware i hate it but it works

1169
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,960
right so you you hate your fridge you

1170
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,800
hate it it's really annoying

1171
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,400
or you hate your tv it doesn't mean you

1172
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,599
buy a new tv tomorrow right you you

1173
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,920
it's not enough to not like you you need

1174
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,240
some reason to actually replace it

1175
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,160
and in the end actually our value

1176
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,320
proposition was very very different

1177
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,359
and it was very much about usability uh

1178
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,400
what we call orchestration

1179
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,079
defragmentation i'll explain a bit later

1180
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,800
on and npc was an important part of that

1181
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,920
story

1182
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,079
but it was very much under the hood

1183
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,520
it was the fact that you could do

1184
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,760
something purely in software enabled us

1185
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,839
to do many many interesting things

1186
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,920
so all that needed to be was software

1187
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,040
okay then you asked the question but if

1188
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,560
it's software it's not really secure

1189
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,680
because you have the key on the machine

1190
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,240
okay that was solved by doing mpc

1191
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,359
but what's really important about the

1192
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,359
solution is that it's software so if i

1193
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,880
can give you security and software then

1194
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,319
i can certainly do very interesting

1195
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,079
things that are important to you in

1196
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,240
terms of usability

1197
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,079
um and there was something else that

1198
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,200
that was true on the security side and

1199
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,400
it's not true that people don't buy for

1200
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
security they do as well and that is

1201
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,560
that we understood that we can solve

1202
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,839
something that other people haven't

1203
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,000
solved and that's what we called key

1204
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,760
misuse resistance so

1205
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,119
legacy key protection was about

1206
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,880
preventing someone from stealing the key

1207
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,640
i have a database of 10 million

1208
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,400
encrypted credit cards

1209
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,839
i don't want someone to steal that

1210
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,280
encrypted database and the key and

1211
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,119
decrypt everything at home

1212
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,520
if they could interact online and ask

1213
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,319
for 10 000 decryptions overnight

1214
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,680
i don't care

1215
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,599
losing 10 000 credit cards i don't care

1216
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,599
losing 10 million i care about much much

1217
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,960
more

1218
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,839
um but if but there are cases and two

1219
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,680
very

1220
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,440
significant cases are cryptocurrencies

1221
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,920
and code signing it's sometimes enough

1222
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,240
to have one c one fraudulent signature

1223
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,000
one fortune operation and it's going

1224
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,720
over i just need one fraudulent

1225
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,000
signature on an ios update

1226
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,200
to now turn millions of iphones into

1227
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,960
malicious devices

1228
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,040
it's enough to have one malicious

1229
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,319
signature on the banking app that i can

1230
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,079
now deploy a fraudulent banking app and

1231
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,319
steal lots of people's money

1232
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,480
in cryptocurrency if i'm present if i'm

1233
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,040
protecting 100 million dollars with a

1234
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,440
key it's enough to have one signature i

1235
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,280
don't need to steal the key i to

1236
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,599
interact with the system and with npc

1237
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,599
you can split the key into num a number

1238
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,920
of places and including people and you

1239
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,359
can have each of those different

1240
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,760
machines verify policy

1241
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
and even maybe have humans look at it

1242
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,359
and verify that cryptographically so you

1243
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,119
can't bypass

1244
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,280
all of those checks and then get to the

1245
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,880
single machine that issues the request

1246
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,480
to sign

1247
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,680
and it turns out that was very

1248
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,119
significant for example in codesigning

1249
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,440
we had one customer who what we were

1250
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,119
doing that they were very excited about

1251
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,040
uh we had actually asked us for what we

1252
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,240
were already building which is a good

1253
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,280
sign

1254
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,440
is that each npc participant would run a

1255
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,760
malware scan on the code

1256
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,119
before they would agree to participate

1257
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,040
in the mpc protocol this is something

1258
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,480
that becomes much much harder to bypass

1259
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,359
bob blakely who was one of our investors

1260
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,440
at citibank

1261
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,960
said the following thing and this is a

1262
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,359
really really important uh

1263
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,119
saying at least it was for us

1264
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,240
it's

1265
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,680
always easier to sell a product that

1266
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,920
improves usability without sacrificing

1267
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,480
security that it is to sell a product

1268
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,200
that improves security without

1269
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,280
sacrificing its ability that may be sad

1270
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,800
for many of us in this room what do you

1271
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,720
mean i'm giving you better security

1272
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,480
don't you want that yes i want that but

1273
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,400
i can't measure it

1274
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,480
it's always best if you improve both

1275
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,280
right

1276
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,560
as security people want to improve

1277
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
security but in order for people to buy

1278
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,160
it i have to improve usability because

1279
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,560
usability they can measure oh i can

1280
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,599
onboard customers much faster oh if

1281
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,520
someone loses their credentials i can

1282
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,440
fix that much more easily i can save

1283
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,440
money oh the number of people i need to

1284
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,280
administer this infrastructure is much

1285
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,119
lower i can save money

1286
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,800
i can move to the cloud more easily

1287
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,720
because it's more agile these are things

1288
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,880
that people understand and can measure

1289
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,040
and they will therefore buy and if we

1290
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,800
have security products that do that as

1291
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,640
well then people will also buy those

1292
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,640
security products more and and then

1293
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,880
that's a win-win for all of us

1294
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,800
so what about the compelling event event

1295
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,440
why should i buy now so people often

1296
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,119
look at regular compliance as something

1297
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,440
which they don't like i think it's a

1298
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,760
it's very important for for the security

1299
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,359
world it's very important for people

1300
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,520
want to sell security because that's

1301
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,680
often the reason why people buy i want

1302
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,800
to gdpr forces me to encrypt i want to

1303
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,599
move to the cloud and i need to encrypt

1304
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:50,800
either because there's regular

1305
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,640
compliance externally or because my

1306
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,319
internal security team says that i have

1307
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,119
to so these are it becomes security

1308
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,440
becomes a business enabler the fact that

1309
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,880
i enable you to do something more

1310
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
efficiently more easily

1311
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,240
means that i can actually do business

1312
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,839
and now i can measure how much this is

1313
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,160
worth for me immediate cost savings of

1314
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,319
course also help but

1315
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,240
the immediate is really important

1316
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,079
because if i can show you that you need

1317
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,920
to replace your entire infrastructure

1318
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,119
and in three or four years time you're

1319
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,880
going to save money you say that's very

1320
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,319
nice but what do i do for the next three

1321
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,880
or four years

1322
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,240
understanding the compelling event is

1323
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,760
also important like i talked about

1324
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,400
beforehand because now i can talk

1325
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,720
to my customer about the problems they

1326
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,319
have and the reason why they should be

1327
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,079
buying and if i don't understand why

1328
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,160
they're going to buy i can't do that and

1329
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,240
that also becomes difficult so i want to

1330
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,000
go through just a few slides of what we

1331
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,839
ended up with in contrast to what we had

1332
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,440
in the beginning just to try to

1333
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,640
demonstrate this and i'm going to go

1334
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,960
really really quickly so today's

1335
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,480
cryptographic infrastructure is all

1336
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,520
fragmented there are different

1337
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,160
environments i have keys in data centers

1338
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,640
and in clouds and

1339
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,319
i need to migrate things and there are

1340
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,960
different uh keys physical hsms and

1341
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,800
cloud hsms and cloud key management

1342
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,200
systems and and

1343
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,200
different interfaces when i talk to my

1344
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,440
age when talk to my keys i need to use

1345
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,800
there are different libraries that are

1346
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,720
supported and i have to manage them all

1347
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,880
different and it's a huge mess and and

1348
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,800
we're crying every day at work and i

1349
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,960
have management problems and consumption

1350
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,040
problems and and and i want to kill

1351
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,480
myself so

1352
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,839
what do i need to do

1353
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,599
i want to give you unified orchestration

1354
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,280
i want to tell you that you can manage

1355
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,760
all of your keys in all of your

1356
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
key stores in from one place and you can

1357
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,680
consume cryptography in a unified way so

1358
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,480
you'll talk via one system and that will

1359
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,200
translate to all these archaic machines

1360
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,280
and things that you have everywhere

1361
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,200
so it's really about

1362
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,720
working in a more

1363
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,640
in a more efficient manner and then you

1364
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,480
know this is this is the world that

1365
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,480
could be you can have this what we call

1366
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,440
unbound core and you have a virtual hsm

1367
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,680
that you can use to talk in a unified

1368
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,920
manner uh to whatever key store at the

1369
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,240
bottom here of you know cloud key stores

1370
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,800
and physical hsms and the unbound mpc

1371
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,119
keystore and maybe secure enclaves and

1372
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,640
you have different applications on top

1373
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,960
and everything can work via this unified

1374
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,280
world that's all pretty and nice and and

1375
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,880
and we have good graphic designers to do

1376
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,040
it and and and you should know that you

1377
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,160
know when you're using software you

1378
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,359
should feel okay because we have this

1379
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,280
thing called npc and we have fips level

1380
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,000
two certified but look at the benefits

1381
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,839
the benefits don't talk about our cool

1382
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,839
protocols they talk about supporting

1383
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,319
cloud migration and cryptography at the

1384
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,680
edge where your protocol where your

1385
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,040
application actually runs it's more

1386
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,119
efficient built in high availability in

1387
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,720
disaster recovery because of software

1388
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,720
you don't have to worry about having

1389
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,560
multiple hsms now in different data

1390
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,240
centers around the world

1391
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,560
it's fully virtualized and it's also

1392
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,480
more secure

1393
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,800
okay that that just and you can you

1394
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,000
might be rolling your eyes and saying

1395
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,359
well he's really become a marketing

1396
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,160
person get this this person off stage uh

1397
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,240
um but but actually if you want people

1398
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,200
to buy

1399
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,079
your

1400
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,760
products this is the language you need

1401
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,920
to talk talk to them with because and if

1402
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,280
it's true it's fine okay it's okay to to

1403
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,000
to talk marketing speak if it's true

1404
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,480
it's less okay when it's not at least in

1405
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,319
my opinion but let's contrast this to

1406
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,079
what we started with this is the way we

1407
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,960
started these are four slides the top we

1408
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,119
started talking about we have technology

1409
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,160
based on

1410
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,240
strong scientific routes using secure

1411
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,240
multi-party computation here there's a

1412
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,400
real problem in the data that the data

1413
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,559
security center challenge there are

1414
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:25,680
attackers everywhere and they're

1415
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,280
breaching our networks

1416
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,160
and

1417
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,599
the challenge isn't being met because

1418
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,359
they're all of these breaches and look

1419
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,640
here we have this really cool thing

1420
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,400
where we can connect a database to two

1421
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,559
machines that will talk to each other

1422
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:37,920
and this just

1423
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,720
it's all about the technology now people

1424
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,559
who the first slide is completely

1425
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,559
relevant for customers who cares

1426
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,040
the second slide either you

1427
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,720
understand that you're being breached

1428
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,839
and you're looking for a solution that i

1429
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,680
have to tell you or you don't understand

1430
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,760
that me telling you won't help so we

1431
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,680
gave up very early on trying to educate

1432
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,200
our customers to be more secure either

1433
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,559
you're already aware of it and then

1434
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,160
we'll provide a solution or you're not

1435
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,240
relevant for us that's not true for all

1436
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,520
products we were a more high-end

1437
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,960
security product but that's typically

1438
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,760
the case with with newer technology

1439
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,720
and and the last slide is

1440
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,960
yeah okay but but that's not the point

1441
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,040
what value are you going to bring

1442
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,760
uh and that's not the value at all

1443
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,839
so there's much more i could talk about

1444
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,359
uh things like what's called product

1445
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,000
market food and focus

1446
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,680
being a researcher and a co-founder and

1447
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,760
a lot of dilemmas that are there

1448
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,760
but i just don't have time

1449
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,720
uh

1450
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,559
so i do want to talk a little bit about

1451
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,400
what we still have to achieve before i

1452
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,079
conclude and take questions

1453
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,920
so firstly we should be aware that

1454
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,520
although we have commercialization

1455
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,640
successes

1456
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,359
we're still very very early in the game

1457
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,359
and we still have a long way to go

1458
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,440
industry knows about us npc a lot of

1459
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,200
people know it is but still there are

1460
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,200
many many more who need to and the more

1461
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,960
industry knows the more they'll come

1462
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,040
with the relevant use cases it's very

1463
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,960
hard for us to know what people's real

1464
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,040
problems are without being there that's

1465
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,280
why by the way as an academic consulting

1466
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,200
is a good thing it's a very good thing

1467
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,640
to consult because you understand what

1468
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,920
problems people are actually trying to

1469
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,079
solve

1470
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,559
but all of this in my at least in my

1471
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,640
mind will remain limited

1472
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,839
because as long as mpc requires great

1473
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,640
expertise to deploy

1474
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,480
there's just a limit in the bandwidth of

1475
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,400
people who can actually go ahead and do

1476
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,119
it

1477
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,880
so either what happens is you have

1478
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,160
really really

1479
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,280
bad npc solutions out there

1480
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,440
or it's just enough bandwidth and

1481
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,440
therefore it doesn't really grow so as a

1482
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,640
community

1483
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,559
one of the big challenges is for us to

1484
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,280
make mpc an off-the-shelf product

1485
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,960
something that i can it's not going to

1486
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,760
be like using stl data structures fine

1487
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,400
but can we make it as

1488
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,839
hard or easy to use what we're going to

1489
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,440
call it as

1490
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,440
or second authenticated encryption or

1491
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,559
tls

1492
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,480
that's where we have to go

1493
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,079
and it's very hard even to define what

1494
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,440
that means

1495
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,079
but um as long as we need a phd in

1496
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,520
cryptography actually today you need a

1497
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,680
phd in npc phd in cryptography also

1498
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,960
probably isn't enough

1499
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,079
um

1500
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,720
that's uh as long as we need that that's

1501
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,440
a

1502
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,240
significant barrier to mass adoption so

1503
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,040
that's a call out for for here

1504
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,880
so important less some important lessons

1505
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,280
i think we can take away

1506
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,440
science is a process

1507
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,040
and it's a process that we as a

1508
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,920
community go through and it can take a

1509
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,520
long time to become technology but

1510
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,760
that's fine our our goal at least in my

1511
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,559
opinion our role in in this community is

1512
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,599
to solve problems for 10 20 years time

1513
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,559
the problems companies are having now

1514
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,240
they can solve that's not our problem so

1515
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,119
much

1516
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,720
it's not we can always earn some extra

1517
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,400
money by helping them but but it's not

1518
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,960
our academic role our academic role is

1519
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,119
to solve problems for the future and we

1520
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,960
do that i believe we do that very very

1521
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,839
well

1522
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,119
we don't know what we're working on

1523
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,119
today we have no idea which papers in

1524
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,280
this conference are going to be

1525
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,359
important sometimes sometimes you have

1526
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,000
papers which are completely unimportant

1527
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,680
but they're techniques like in terms of

1528
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,599
what they're solving but the techniques

1529
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,200
you saw inside suddenly become very

1530
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,200
relevant in other places and we never

1531
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,400
actually know

1532
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,839
and i think a really good thing is that

1533
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,920
today especially looking today versus 20

1534
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,240
years ago the interaction between

1535
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,200
academia and industry is

1536
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,000
extremely

1537
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,359
[Music]

1538
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:22,559
active active there's a lot of

1539
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,720
interaction people go back and forth

1540
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,200
people talk to each other uh these these

1541
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,559
are very very positive things and i

1542
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,800
think it shows a huge success that we

1543
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,319
have as a community

1544
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:33,920
so i want to end by saying thank you or

1545
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,599
maybe it's a bit exceptional to say this

1546
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,920
but i i really believe that i

1547
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,119
owe a debt of gratitude to this

1548
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,280
community i think it's a really friendly

1549
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,200
and supportive community i remember as a

1550
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,280
young graduate students very senior

1551
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,720
people

1552
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,079
coming up to me after my talk and

1553
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,240
telling me giving me good feedback

1554
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,319
people helping each other people

1555
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,480
sincerely being excited at other

1556
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,000
people's work

1557
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,440
this is a really really great community

1558
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,280
and we should appreciate it and and i do

1559
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,200
and i want to thank you all for inviting

1560
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,839
me and and for all the years of joint

1561
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:07,640
work together thank you

1562
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,839
uh well thank you for fascinating talk

1563
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,400
um i'll start with one questions but if

1564
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,720
uh there are you know i will probably

1565
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,920
not be able to take all the questions

1566
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,319
but people can come to the mic so i

1567
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,319
guess one question is really two dual

1568
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,960
questions so you said it's very useful

1569
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,880
for credit missions to

1570
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,319
for academics to be involved in

1571
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,480
consulting and hopefully the other way

1572
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,480
around for applied or for companies

1573
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,559
interesting cryptography to employ

1574
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,480
academics what's your advice in both

1575
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,760
directions

1576
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,520
if an academic

1577
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,359
what can you do proactively so that

1578
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,680
people can talk to you contact companies

1579
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,359
or the other way around for companies

1580
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,880
how to

1581
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,480
get better engage in these academics

1582
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,480
it's kind of i i don't have any i i

1583
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,520
don't know

1584
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,280
it's sometimes luck it's sometimes just

1585
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,000
being out there and and i think the

1586
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,200
active interaction that's happening

1587
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,240
today

1588
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,200
makes it work but i i i don't i don't

1589
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,480
think i have any

1590
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,359
tips i do think that companies who

1591
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,839
um do cryptography it's extremely

1592
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:20,640
important that there are real

1593
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,920
cryptographers in those companies i

1594
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,839
think it's happening much more today

1595
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,640
20 years ago it wasn't the case 20 years

1596
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,800
ago i know of a number of companies that

1597
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,640
did a lot of cryptography and said oh we

1598
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,760
don't need a crypt any we don't need a

1599
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,920
cryptographer because we're doing just

1600
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,559
you know basic things and they were not

1601
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,400
so i think on that side companies really

1602
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,200
need to to make sure they have uh people

1603
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,720
who can do it and

1604
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,240
from outside and

1605
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,319
luck i guess

1606
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,760
all right thank you

1607
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,000
mike

1608
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,000
it's not on as a mic theory

1609
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,920
the mic isn't working for mike

1610
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,640
oh yeah maybe also i don't know yeah

1611
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,480
i just feel that joke if the question is

1612
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,319
short you can i guess uh repeat it for

1613
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,640
zoom people but yeah okay uh thanks for

1614
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,920
the great talk

1615
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,280
i'm wondering if you have

1616
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,880
discussions with people in industry

1617
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,960
about like semi honest malicious uc

1618
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,720
standalone are these things important to

1619
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,640
them do you just say hey i wrote the

1620
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,559
textbook so you can trust me and like

1621
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,960
how can that inform us as as researchers

1622
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,640
so i i really think that just just

1623
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,160
before i answer the first question the

1624
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,240
the second you know sort of quip i think

1625
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,559
it's really important that we don't say

1626
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,040
things like just trust us because we're

1627
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,720
and transparency is really important

1628
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,640
it's actually quite easy for us because

1629
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,680
as a community we believe in

1630
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,760
transparency and it's not the industry

1631
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,960
norms so

1632
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,559
it was very important for us we were

1633
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,079
very transparent and in fact sometimes

1634
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,280
sales people got mad at me because i

1635
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,040
would even point out like some of the

1636
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,640
weaknesses of our solution like here is

1637
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,319
what's really good but this actually is

1638
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,000
you know be aware that this is you know

1639
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,440
not ideal you have to be careful about

1640
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,440
that and that was sort of like frown but

1641
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,119
but the customers actually appreciate it

1642
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,280
and it was so full transparency and

1643
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,920
explaining it i do think that that that

1644
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,680
customers care especially what we were

1645
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,240
doing that it's maliciously secure uh

1646
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,720
absolutely and we will talk about that

1647
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,000
uh because if you're talking about a

1648
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,680
case where somebody takes over a machine

1649
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,880
then if they take over a machine they

1650
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,480
take over a machine

1651
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,520
uh

1652
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,200
does it mean they go into the nuances of

1653
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,280
uc security or not it depends we had one

1654
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,880
customer who

1655
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,559
a very big customer i can't say their

1656
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,880
name who engaged with a prominent

1657
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,480
university in europe

1658
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,160
where they had uh three or four

1659
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,400
cryptographers who who did a very big

1660
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,760
job of going through everything and then

1661
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,359
yesterday they wrote a report where they

1662
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,119
related to all of those things so so it

1663
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,319
depends

1664
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,319
uh it depends but we were always very

1665
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,720
happy to do what we call a deep dive uh

1666
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,119
very happy to always uh

1667
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,559
we would always hope that on the other

1668
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,400
side to be a cryptographer and sometimes

1669
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,920
there were

1670
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,960
but i think that yes explaining the

1671
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,319
showing that you're willing to explain

1672
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,760
everything and having materials that

1673
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,680
have all of those details is actually is

1674
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,680
very important and often what happens is

1675
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,359
when you show that level of transparency

1676
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,720
then they say okay don't worry i trust

1677
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,079
you it's when you don't want to show

1678
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:03,359
them levels of transparency that they

1679
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,280
don't

1680
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,559
nida

1681
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,960
i was wondering if you could uh do the

1682
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,319
little exposition that you had on

1683
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:11,920
balancing being a co-founder and a

1684
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,400
researcher that you skipped over okay so

1685
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,160
so a couple of a couple of things that i

1686
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,839
would like to say number one is that as

1687
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:21,040
a scientist we have a lot of respect for

1688
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,880
fields of expertise

1689
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,480
and this is a bad thing

1690
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,720
because what happens is that i started

1691
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,760
the first four years i was chief

1692
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,680
scientist and every time but i was

1693
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,599
co-founder so every time i was asked a

1694
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:32,799
question which related to business i

1695
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:33,520
would say

1696
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,040
i don't know

1697
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,720
but you have to give an opinion and then

1698
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,839
i would just throw something out because

1699
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:38,960
i don't know it's not my field of

1700
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,319
expertise i know npc i don't know

1701
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,000
anything else i don't know lattices and

1702
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,440
they're asking about business

1703
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,960
uh

1704
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,520
and actually it's a huge mistake as a

1705
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,079
founder and and as a researcher who

1706
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,599
understands the technology it's really

1707
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:52,960
important to

1708
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,520
make the effort to understand the

1709
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,119
business problems that we're trying to

1710
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,680
solve and what we can and cannot do

1711
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,400
and the and as researchers actually we

1712
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,599
have a lot of

1713
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,839
our thought processes uh the rigorous

1714
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,200
way that we

1715
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,640
uh um go through and

1716
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,480
research a problem and understand it and

1717
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,880
apply logical reasoning these are all

1718
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,640
things that actually are very beneficial

1719
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,799
we have to be not afraid to do that and

1720
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,720
often we are because we're intimidated

1721
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,680
by this person who's the ceo and he's

1722
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,599
you know he or she has done multiple

1723
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,520
companies and and they know all about

1724
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,280
business and we don't know anything it

1725
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,400
doesn't mean that we should be arrogant

1726
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,079
and say that we know everything we don't

1727
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,000
in fact one of our advantages is that we

1728
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,920
obviously don't know

1729
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,400
so we we take the effort to listen and

1730
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,079
to study and learn i think that's one of

1731
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,079
the that's a really important thing the

1732
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,079
second thing i'll say is that doing both

1733
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,079
is an absolute nightmare

1734
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,200
uh uh it was my life was much worse when

1735
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,079
i was

1736
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,760
half time in university halftime as

1737
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,880
chief scientist than when i was

1738
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,880
full-time ceo which is amazing because

1739
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,359
ceo of a startup is is

1740
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:58,319
so

1741
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,160
um

1742
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,000
doing both is really really hard and

1743
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,200
that's why i talk about the commitment

1744
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,559
it requires a lot of commitment it

1745
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:05,839
doesn't mean you can't

1746
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,440
and people shouldn't say well if i can't

1747
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,559
if i'm not going to i don't i want to

1748
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:09,760
stay in university i shouldn't found a

1749
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,920
company it's just to be aware that if

1750
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,920
you're really a founder and not just

1751
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,079
sitting from afar and throwing

1752
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,839
cryptographic ideas to the team but

1753
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:20,240
you're actually really a fan a founder

1754
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,400
it's it's uh requires a lot of

1755
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,520
commitment

1756
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,960
um but just like when you have a really

1757
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,640
really hard research problem that at the

1758
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,200
end succeeds there's a great

1759
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,799
personal reward

1760
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,799
uh here too uh it's it's similar

1761
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:37,440
but somewhat more lucrative

1762
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,280
uh okay danielle maybe we'll take a

1763
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,720
couple of more but

1764
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,440
okay hi thank you so much so just a

1765
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,280
quick question we know that we can get

1766
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,960
more practicality if we introduce

1767
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,559
assumptions like honest majority and

1768
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,240
non-collusion and so on i wonder how you

1769
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,680
will motivate these assumptions in

1770
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,119
practical settings

1771
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:55,040
so one thing which i think is really

1772
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,319
important is that there is no answer

1773
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,440
and many very often you'll hear people

1774
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,359
who say things like

1775
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,040
in practice that's not important or in

1776
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,799
practice this is what you need and maybe

1777
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:09,280
it's true of their experience

1778
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,640
but there are many many different

1779
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,240
applications and there are many many

1780
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,079
different settings and it's true that

1781
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:15,280
they're in some settings it's not

1782
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,880
important and in some settings it is

1783
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,280
important one of the things about

1784
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,440
startups is that you're doing something

1785
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,040
brand new

1786
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,520
so there is no rulebook there is no

1787
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,119
cookbook and there is no there are no

1788
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,520
there's no clear answers it depends on

1789
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,200
the application

1790
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,200
and if for that application it makes

1791
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,040
sense and it's good enough and people

1792
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,480
are happy with it then you know it's

1793
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,480
good enough and if it doesn't make sense

1794
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,319
then it then it doesn't but you don't

1795
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:41,280
really

1796
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,760
you can't really know without

1797
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,640
understanding what the problem is that

1798
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,480
people are trying to solve what threats

1799
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,400
are they concerned about what threats

1800
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,319
are they less concerned about

1801
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,559
so what what is your application domain

1802
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,599
is the main motivation security or is

1803
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,400
the main motivation compliance

1804
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,000
so there is no answer i i apologize for

1805
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,839
for answering that like a politician

1806
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:06,880
thank you

1807
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,960
i guess alice on the last one

1808
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,559
uh yes i just want to ask one of the

1809
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,480
questions that came in on zoom oh thank

1810
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,880
you thank you but also uh one quick

1811
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,559
announcement the rump session submission

1812
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,520
deadline is tonight at 5 p.m

1813
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,520
so please get those in uh here's a

1814
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,760
question from our zoom audience how do

1815
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,559
you foresee mpc solutions in a decade

1816
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,240
compared to hardware-based trusted

1817
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,559
execution environments

1818
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,480
oh okay so

1819
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:32,980
um

1821
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,000
i think that if trusted execution

1822
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,920
environments actually end up being built

1823
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,119
on completely isolated separate chips

1824
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,960
then maybe there's hope for them

1825
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,559
currently the experience of trying to

1826
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:45,599
combine

1827
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,839
in the one processor has been a very big

1828
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,599
failure in my mind it doesn't mean it

1829
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,359
can't be used i think there's a primary

1830
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,440
security solution it's not good enough i

1831
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,480
think that

1832
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,480
that trusted computing or secure

1833
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,000
enclaves or whatever as a secondary

1834
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,599
solution is secondary level is is

1835
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,040
helpful but i don't think it's secure

1836
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,240
enough

1837
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:04,640
um

1838
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,760
[Music]

1839
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,319
there's always a challenge with hardware

1840
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:08,570
in

1841
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:09,839
[Music]

1842
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:12,640
you know again if the world is such that

1843
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,000
and it's something that we often do as

1844
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,520
scientists right we say

1845
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,559
um

1846
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:17,839
like let's say i'll give you a different

1847
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,440
example so i said that you know that

1848
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,040
with mpc we can do this policy

1849
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,359
verification in different places

1850
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:24,640
a scientist you start thinking one

1851
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,880
second but the hsn vendors can also just

1852
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,640
do that they can put inside the hsm they

1853
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,559
can put a policy checker and what's the

1854
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:31,920
answer

1855
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,559
but they haven't

1856
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,160
and that's the truth it's not just what

1857
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,079
you can do it's what actually is in

1858
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:39,359
products what

1859
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:40,960
options the customers actually have to

1860
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,000
use

1861
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,799
so

1862
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,559
will it be a world where there's this

1863
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,319
one secure execution environment which

1864
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:47,680
is actually easy to use and it's

1865
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,079
actually truly secure and is actually

1866
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,240
deployed worldwide and everybody has

1867
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,160
access to the same thing

1868
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,599
you that's what we call in cryptography

1869
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,839
the ideal world so

1870
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,760
you know i don't

1871
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,920
will it actually i don't know you know i

1872
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,799
i'm not good at prophecies

1873
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,000
but i think that mpc will have a place

1874
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,520
it's always going to be more flexible

1875
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,160
than hardware uh it's going to not gonna

1876
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,599
be vulnerable to what we call a single

1877
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,039
point of failure or single point of

1878
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,240
compromise

1879
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,520
uh so i think that it has a lot of

1880
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,559
potential irrespective of uh of trusted

1881
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,799
uh execution environment what i like the

1882
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:25,359
most is to run your mpc protocol inside

1883
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,200
a trusted execution environment even if

1884
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,200
someone gets to one of the machines they

1885
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,480
don't get the secrets then i have to

1886
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,000
break that enclave as well i think

1887
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,079
that's a that's that's a very very nice

1888
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,119
monolith in my opinion

1889
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,280
all right then well let's thank you

1890
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:44,520
again and hopefully thank you very much

1891
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,520
you
