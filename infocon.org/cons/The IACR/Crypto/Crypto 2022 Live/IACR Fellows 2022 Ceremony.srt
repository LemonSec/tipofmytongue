have joined to npt and started working

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,840
on crypto cryptography

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,560
so i'm really

54
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,000

looking back

57
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
it has been

58
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,480
sometimes a pleasure

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,800
and sometimes a pain

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,560
to continue working in uh

61
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,840
the same area of research and the same

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,319
in the same community for such a long

63
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,519
time

64
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,959
and to observe

65
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:09,920
how

66
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,440
my

67
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,120
planted sheets

68
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,239
have

69
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,920
turned out

70
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,280
but

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,480
if you ask

72
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,760
i definitely say that uh i derived so

73
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,720
much uh so much pleasure out of this

74
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,400
work

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,120
so um

76
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,280
um this is a

77
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,319
kind of consequence of my 30 years of

78
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,360
work

79
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,159
which would not have been possible

80
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,640
without having many support

81
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,280
from many people

82
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,319
and

83
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,040
it's of course impossible to name them

84
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,480
all here

85
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,720
so i would like to

86
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,879
[Music]

87
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,560
thank

88
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,840
my three great uh mentors

89
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,159
that's like yokamoto

90
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,360
woody muller and tarabin

91
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,720
who

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,760
have

93
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,040
profound

94
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,480
influence to my career

95
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,480
and finally

96
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
and which is

97
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,280
which i think most importantly

98
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,478
i'd like to take this opportunity to

99
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,759
express my gratitude to all those who

100
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,280
supported me

101
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,639
without my uh realizing it

102
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,840
thanks a lot

103
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,560
so

104
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,360
the second fellow uh

105
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,240
as you know is christian kashan who was

106
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,000
the three uh

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,240
previous acr president

108
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,280
and he

109
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,160
became an icr fellow for

110
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
far-reaching contributions in the fields

111
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,360
of cryptography and distributed systems

112
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,560
and for outstanding service to the iscr

113
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,360
so i i'm not sure if the

114
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,680
christian is attending online or not i

115
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,240
cannot see the

116
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,719
i don't see him

117
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,759
then

118
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,800
he's anyways he expects he's expected to

119
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,759
receive as a awarding person next year

120
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,479
at eurocrypt

121
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,720
so

122
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,720
next

123
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,479
really

124
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
the next acr fellow

125
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,639
from

126
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,440
2022 is called kali

127
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
for fundamental contributions to the

128
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,400
design and analysis of boolean functions

129
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,800
for cryptographic applications and for

130
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,080
sustained

131
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,360
sustained educational leadership

132
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,400
i also

133
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,680
believe that

134
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,000
floyd is not online given that it's

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,440
quite late in europe

136
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,400
so

137
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,359
let's all thank him again

138
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,120
um

139
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,039
the first uh

140
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,319
new fellow in the list is benny pinkas

141
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,240
and he's

142
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,639
he received this award for impactful

143
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,639
research in the theory and practice of

144
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,199
secure multi-party compensation

145
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,160
sustained educational leadership

146
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,639
and service to the icr

147
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,520
so i also believe that

148
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,720
ben is not

149
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,319
online

150
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,440
he expects you he will try he's not sure

151
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,720
perhaps he's going to receive the

152
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,120
awarding person at asia crypt or next

153
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,639
year

154
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,080
so but let's

155
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,840
congratulate him again

156
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,680
and uh

157
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,080
finally

158
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,759
the fifth

159
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,440
new acr fellow is yael dalman kalai

160
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,160
and she received his uh

161
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,560
award for foundational contributions in

162
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,720
delegated computation

163
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
and leaked resilient cryptography in

164
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,919
service to the cryptographic community

165
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,720
uh eile actually was plenty to attend in

166
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,840
person

167
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,120
due to

168
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,199
changes in the

169
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,360
microsoft policy

170
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,840
and allow

171
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,039
her for

172
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,400
her to come

173
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,199
uh

174
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,120
yeah she was not able to attend in

175
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,080
person

176
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,639
i'm not sure if she's online i cannot

177
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,800
see

178
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,440
kevin would you know

179
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,879
i don't see her

180
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,280
okay so that's anyways let's

181
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,799
congratulate the ielts

182
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,080
hard to be able to see probably the list

183
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,240
of participants

184
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,759
uh

185
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,120
next uh i would like to start the awards

186
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,560
section uh of this ceremony

187
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,400
first uh

188
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,199
the icr test of time awards as you know

189
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,680
this is given yearly for

190
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,240
uh for each one of the three general

191
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,599
conferences

192
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,399
uh for a paper to recognize papers with

193
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,200
a lasting impact on the field

194
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,958
and in the particular case of the

195
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,880
general conferences

196
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,600
we select papers that were published 15

197
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,360
years prior

198
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,480
so

199
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,360
the committee is formed usually by two

200
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,240
members as selected by the board

201
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,480
appointed by the board plus

202
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,120
three of the program chairs one for each

203
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
general conference

204
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,560
so

205
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,360
this year the committee was

206
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,760
led by nigel smart

207
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
and

208
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,040
the other nominated member was kazuy

209
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,440
sako who will become the the chair of

210
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,000
next year's committee

211
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
and the the other members of the

212
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,519
committee was

213
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,000
agro stefan zambowski and tom stranton

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,040
and uh

215
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,480
for crypto

216
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,320
the test of time award uh it was given

217
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,560
for me ebellari

218
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,600
uh sasha boudreaver and adam o'neill for

219
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,000
their paper on deterministic deficient

220
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,399
efficiently searchable encryption

221
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,320
so uh please

222
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,560
come over

223
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,720
so

224
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,399
as you can see i

225
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,120
also did an amazing job at

226
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
finding very nice

227
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,640
for the test of time award

228
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,600
future general chairs will have to

229
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,839
live up to it

230
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,880
so but uh congratulations

231
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
yeah

232
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,720
so thanks to the committee and thanks to

233
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
everyone for this award uh thanks to my

234
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,920
co-authors

235
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,560
mia and sasha

236
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,880
um this was my first paper and uh

237
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,440
you know how i learned to play do game

238
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,720
playing proofs and stuff like that

239
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,800
um

240
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,720
i uh i thought it would be nice to

241
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,000
acknowledge

242
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,920
other work that was kind of related at

243
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,600
the time

244
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,440
there was work on entropic security by

245
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,320
donating smith

246
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,600
so

247
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,760
rogoway and shrimpton

248
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,040
had a

249
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,160
paper on kind of the symmetric key case

250
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,279
as well um there was also perfectly

251
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,720
one-way

252
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,040
functions uh so

253
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,800
um i think it was kind of in the air at

254
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,920
the time

255
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,839
and in retrospect it's a natural problem

256
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,680
to consider

257
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,800
um it also had uh

258
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,560
i think it's interesting that it had uh

259
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,399
kind of it was picked up in interesting

260
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,800
ways in future work so for example

261
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,120
um if you look at the notion of uh

262
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,399
universal uh computational extractor

263
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,120
um this is a generalization of

264
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
correlated input hashing which is

265
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,600
deterministic encryption without uh

266
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,120
decryption

267
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,360
um and the goal of

268
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,600
ucs was to

269
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,320
instantiate random oracles uh

270
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,839
which is kind of ironic because we use

271
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,640
random oracles in our paper um and our

272
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,320
goal is not to instantiate our oracles

273
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,000
obviously so it's interesting though

274
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,880
it's picked up um in other contexts

275
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,760
um but yeah uh that's kind of my

276
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,279
reflection on the paper and thanks

277
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,279
everyone for that work

278
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,360
and uh i realized

279
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,160
i realized yesterday that it was a kind

280
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,639
of academic family work me here used to

281
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,959
be my advisor and i used to be adam's

282
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,480
advisor so

283
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,440
it's

284
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,800
it's nice thank you very much

285
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,399
so next i would like to

286
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,360
call uh grant waters and david wu

287
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,279
to receive the

288
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,000
the plug for best paper award for crypto

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,560
22 for their paper

290
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,600
on

291
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,399
batch arguments for np and more

292
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,839
from standard by linear group

293
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,839
assumptions

294
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,480
so we didn't know we had to say anything

295
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,600
uh so

296
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,120

307
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,839
researcher award

308
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,199
for his paper on breaking rainbow

309
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,959
breaking rainbow takes a weekend on a

310
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,839
laptop

311
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,440

um

313
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,480
i'm not gonna recite a poem so

314
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,680
um

315
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,440
so i would like to thank

316
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,639
rainbow

317
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,240
breaking rainbow is practical

318
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,399
yeah that's it thank you

319
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,720

addis okay

325
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,600

326
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,600
two

327
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,120

thanks to alice and of course

331
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,880
but i'm really sad that she's not here

332
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,839
and shares the attention and

333
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,920
honor of it because it was really a

334
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,519
pressure to work

335
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,160
with her on this paper so yeah thanks

336
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,160
alice

337
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,720
so now i would like to

338

conference possible

340
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
particularly the program chairs and the

341
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,480
general chairs

342
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,759
general chair

343
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,040
um

344
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,399
so i'll start with uh you of kenny

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,480
uh so i'd like to

346
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,800
thank you for your work as program chair

347
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,479
of crypto 2022.

348
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,959
you can i'll i'll speak later yeah so

349
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,920
since uh if genny and uh

350
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,360
