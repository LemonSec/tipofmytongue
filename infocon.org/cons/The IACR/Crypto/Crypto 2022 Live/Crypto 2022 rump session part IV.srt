1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,440
good evening everybody my name is dave

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,919
wheeler and uh this is

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,519
all right what's up

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,440
uh so we're here to give you an

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,679
announcement um amazon is uh looking for

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,199
cryptographers in our devices group so

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,600
you know amazon's doing amazing things

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,680
in devices cloud services and automation

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,800
our vision of ambient intelligence

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,079
weaves ai together with services

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,840
to increase uh

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,040
our customer experiences so sorry you

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,600
know marketing kind of had me say that

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,559
but this is where we need you we need

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,760
you to come to amazon and join us if

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,600
you're interested in coming into

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,760
industry you know maybe you were uh

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,079
influenced by yehuda's talk and say hey

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,760
you know maybe you need to come over and

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,280
and do some uh some real work instead of

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,920
living in the big o world right we're

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,159
doing some really interesting things

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,960
we're we're working on post-quantum

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,080
crypto for uh small devices getting them

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,439
to run on mcu's uh we're working on

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,759
improvements in uh classical uh

27
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,240
protocols getting them to run better

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,119
maybe uh run run smaller

29
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,680
um and we're making all kinds of things

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,640
scalable and and real world

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,119
we're even working on a satellite system

32
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,280
doing a worldwide key management system

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,360
that's post quantum secure so if you're

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,520
interested in any of those things if you

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,200
can code

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,520
we're interested in talking to you so so

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,640
come find me come find luke

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,200
look up the job on linkedin

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,439
come talk to us we're really interested

40
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,360
in in hearing what you have to bring to

41
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,280
the table

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,439
thank you

43
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,280
awesome

44
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,120
hello

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,360
hello crypto community

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,560
hello

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,040
i'm takao

48
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,519
say my name

49
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,319
yeah i'm drunken so

50
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,560
yeah i i make it

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,480
quick so

52
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,000
yeah

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,519
so i i'm

54
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,120
and i'm uh representing crypto lab

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,440
this is a

56
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,040
startup

57
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,440
based on south korea

58
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,440
so

59
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,800
yeah we're basically making software

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,080
libraries implementing uh ckks

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,720
homomorphic encryption

62
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,760
right

63
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,319
you know who will be in christian cks

64
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,159
yeah ckkkk stands for uh chang kim kim

65
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,920
and song

66
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,959
and chan is actually a founder and the

67
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,800
ceo of my con my company

68
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,760
and i

69
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,280
i i

70
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,920
i it happens to my name last name is

71
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
actually kim

72
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,120
but i

73
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,840
i

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,680
neither of these two guys ckk

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,480
because yes there are there are so many

76
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,760
kims in south korea

77
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,280
and not every kings are related to for

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,640
example um

79
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,920
kim jong-un or something

80
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,920
oh yeah basically uh we are we're

81
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,400
company making software library

82
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,959
implementing ckks homework encryption

83
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,239
right

84
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,599
kk is actually dealing with real numbers

85
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,280
or approximate

86
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,720
numbers

87
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,080
and uh

88
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,680
uh

89
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,690
yeah approximate numbers what

90
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,200
[Music]

91
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,079
what what is the important thing to

92
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,279
consider when we do something

93
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,798
approximate

94
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,120
you know

95
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,400
sorry

96
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,400
sorry

97
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,199
i i i think it's uh

98
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,400
it's a precision and uh

99
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,040
you know the speed

100
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,880
right

101
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,280
you don't agree

102
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,040
you know the the bootstrapping

103
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,479
this is the

104
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,960
operation in the whole encryption it's a

105
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,199
circuit to renew ciphertext to

106
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,080
so

107
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,400
so that the users can do multiplications

108
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,240
indefinitely this is a very important

109
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,240
operation

110
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,919
that's it

111
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,560
no that's important

112
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,680
actually yeah that that is very

113
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,160
important

114
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,960
academically

115
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,240
you know

116
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,120
the bootstrapping is very important

117
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
and uh

118
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,080
now company provide the library

119
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,479
that is the processing the precision of

120
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,479
the bootstrapping is very

121
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,360
yeah

122
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,560
very good

123
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,840
you know

124
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,160
the major performance throwback

125
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,520
is the bootstrapping in the

126
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,360
most of

127
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,440
the applications of that

128
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,800
fhe

129
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
and uh

130
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,440
our researchers uh

131
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,560
actually

132
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,520
um

133
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,039
found a new new way to do bootstrapping

134
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,680
this kind of meta bts

135
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,000
let's improve the beat precision about

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,039
40

137
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,319
400

138
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,840
you know 400

139
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,800
400 percent

140
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
very big

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,440
compared to previous worlds yeah

142
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,520
we are very good so

143
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,039
so apply crypto lab this is a company

144
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,440
very good company yeah

145
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,960
yeah if you if you if you feel tired

146
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
on the

147
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,880
academic stops

148
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,000
then feel free to contact me

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,280
to

150
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,799
apply cryptolab

151
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,560
so i can summarize uh better bts stuffs

152
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,360
and

153
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,840
you know one sentence then we can do

154
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,319
bootstrap into

155
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,440
i don't know

156
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
and beat businesses

157
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,800
bts put two you can do two bootstraps in

158
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,639
a row

159
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,400
in a specific way to improve a high and

160
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,199
achieve and high precision you know

161
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,840
okay i don't know because i'm a team

162
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,800
leader and our team

163
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,880
our members do all the stuffs

164
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,000
okay and we are really fast

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,759
uh

166
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,120
gpu

167
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,960
accelerated okay

168

we are

171
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,400
we release our library to the public in

172
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,199
the september 1st and we can you you can

173
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,720
download docker

174
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,199
docker images of our libraries

175
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,520
that's it

176
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,520

177
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,599
so

178
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,320
hi everyone i'm sorry i will disappoint

179
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,519
after the

180
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,599
borrower was set so high with the

181
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,200
previous talk but i'm gonna give a

182
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,839
serious talk about

183
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,640
scarf

184
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
so which is a trick of a block cipher

185
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,399
that we designed for a specific use case

186
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,600
scenario which is cash randomization

187
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,680
and this is joint work with uh team

188
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,760
genesio gregor leander yantoma

189
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,600
yosuketodo and rayueno so

190
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,920
what cache randomization is i'm gonna go

191
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,600
not gonna go into details of that but

192
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
basically it's a mitigation is a way to

193
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,480
mitigate uh against a side channel

194
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,959
attacks that use cash contention

195
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,399
um

196
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,560
that make use of cash contention and

197
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,000
basically the idea is that you want to

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,440
randomize

199
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,279
the cash address which

200
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,320
is uh essentially composed by a tag and

201
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,040
an index i'm simply fine here but

202
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,720
basically and the way you recognize it

203
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,360
is that you take the tag part which will

204
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,760
be the tweak of your encryption

205
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,240
of your tweakable block cipher and the

206
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,360
index p will be the plain text of your

207
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
tweakable vlog cipher

208
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,080
and already the interesting thing here

209
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,279
is that the

210
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,680
plain text which is the index is very

211
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,320
small block length so the that's

212
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,880
only 10 bits which is very unusual

213
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,360
but what's most interesting and what

214
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,440
most unusual is perhaps the attacker

215
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,760
model which basically the attacker can

216
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,360
only learn

217
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,320
upon

218
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,480
querying the encryption function can

219
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,120
only learn whether the ciphertext of two

220
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,600
pairs of plaintext and tweaks collided

221
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,440
or not so cannot learn anything about

222
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,399
the value of the cypher text itself

223
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,839
and

224
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,079
um basically so so far what has been

225
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,680
done is just been

226
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,399
just there i've been proposed uh as

227
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,120
encryption for as way to randomize just

228
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,279
uh block ciphers that are around reduced

229
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,399
versions of known ciphers and this is i

230
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,200
mean with no our security argument at

231
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,360
all and uh yeah so what we we tried to

232
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,760
what we try to do is first of all is

233
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,320
understanding better the taco model and

234
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,480
we try to reduce it to something more

235
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,240
conventional and

236
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,920
so the idea is very simple basically

237
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,160
when so when you have a collision

238
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,040
between

239
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,399
uh

240
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,240
two plaintexts and tweaks what this

241
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,279
means is that actually you can see the

242
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,160
uh

243
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
that one of the plaintext in this case

244
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,880
p2 is actually the decryption

245
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,480
of the

246
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,160
of the ciphertext which means that

247
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,240
actually what the attacker learns

248
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,240
is that uh p1 uh so p2 is actually the

249
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,839
ciphertext of p1 when you consider the

250
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,640
composition of uh

251
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,360
the encryption cipher composed with its

252
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,560
inverse

253
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,959
uh so in other words this means that uh

254
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,560
when you when you have an rrn cypher e

255
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,519
uh as an attacker you are attacking in a

256
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,320
more conventional setting uh 2r round

257
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,480
cipher etilde which again is the

258
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,320
composition of the of your encryption

259
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,880
cipher and its inverse under different

260
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,399
tweaks of course

261
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,519
and

262
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,760
from this you can see that

263
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,720
not even uh not even if you if your e

264
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,079
your encryption

265
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,720
uh block cipher is secure this does not

266
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,160
imply that what the attackers see which

267
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,720
is etilda so the composition with the

268
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,760
decryption is actually secure so what we

269
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,399
did with scarf is we tried to

270
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,320
design a cipher that

271
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,720
was secure in this model and

272
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,120
oh and considering also the very short

273
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,560
block plan

274
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,760
we

275
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,959
had

276
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,839
we chose for uh to use this misti plus

277
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,839
faster structure which

278
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,079
uh has the advantage of having a

279
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,079
non-invertible part which it's a lot of

280
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,160
key which absorbs a lot of keys even the

281
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,680
small rock length and also uh uh can

282
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,440
update non-linearly

283
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,760
the whole state in one round and this

284
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,480
allows us to uh obtain

285
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,440
uh

286
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,760
tweakable ciphered as as actually the

287
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,720
latency of off prince and so please look

288
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,040
forward to it uh when we publish it next

289
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,720
week

290
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,639
you're welcome to try and go and break

291
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,040
it thank you

292
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,880
all right

293
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,440
so i know i have a reputation of doing

294
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,360
funny talks during rum sessions but i

295
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,680
did not have time this year

296
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,240
to prepare a comedy talk

297
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,560
so instead i have a proposal for how we

298
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,120
can make reviewing more efficient

299
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,720
so let me show you a demo

300
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,399
hold on let me share

301
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,380
um

[Music]

308
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,880
thank you

309
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,839
that was barely audible in zoom

310
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,920
i'll fix it in post

311
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,240
upper right

312
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,560
two diagonal arrows there we go

313
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,320
no um

314
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,040
the one below

315
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,040
all right

316
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,079
the dictator is beaten again on the

317
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,120
prevalence of anamorphic cryptography

318
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,480
and while you guys are laughing and

319
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,680
getting drunk cryptography is under

320
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,160
attack

321
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,320
so

322
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,000
all right

323
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,160
so in uh last eurocrypt with pino

324
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,320
perciano and uh

325
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,480
deung you fun

326
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,399
we presented anamorphic encryption

327
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,480
how to keep privacy with respect to a

328
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,720
dictator

329
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,880
and what is a dictator so typical

330
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,519
cryptography is developed under uh two

331
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,880
conditions the receiver keys are hidden

332
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,839
for public cryptography

333
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,000
or and

334
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,560
send their messages are chosen freely by

335
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,119
the sender

336
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,279
however we gave a scenario in which

337
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,040
these two conditions are violated

338
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,199
because there is a dictator

339
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,680
which

340
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,399
he knows the keys and he dictates the

341
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,880
messages

342
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,160
and

343
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,839
this is a little bit of a problem in

344
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,959
cryptography yes

345
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,279
but if the world were perfect it

346
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,040
wouldn't be

347
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,079
so

348
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,440
uh

349
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,199
and governments are

350
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,199
engaged in it not

351
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,000
not even dictators even

352
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,640
democratic governments

353
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,280
and starting from the early 90s and the

354
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,640
clipper chip

355
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,720
the crypto wars are ongoing

356
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,360
and uh

357
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,240
we have to tell the governments is it

358
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,319
the serious efforts you are

359
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,119
engaging in or is it a

360
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,359
is this just exercising futility and uh

361
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,000
therefore we started this work and uh in

362
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,039
eurocrit we show that even though the

363
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,600
dictator owns your key tells you which

364
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,200
messages to send and verifies it

365
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,400
you can still beat the dictator and send

366
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,039
messages that he cannot get

367
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,840
and we did it for two systems one system

368
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,880
based on cca system based on the

369
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,840
so-called narrow young paradigm

370
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,280
and

371
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,480
under the hood there is an anamorphic uh

372
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,559
message we call it anamorphic because

373
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,120
it's a hidden one and you need a special

374
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,080
way

375
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,679
to view it

376
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,919
and

377
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,720
you can do it

378
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,679
while satisfying the dictators

379
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,440
requirements you give it you give the

380
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,240
dictator the keys and you give it and

381
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,000
you follow the messages

382
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,160
and also we showed how to do it with lwe

383
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,240
based systems

384
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,919
and then and technically it's a

385
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,080
combination of steganography

386
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,480
kleptography subvertable encryption and

387
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,760
so on

388
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,919
but it feels good to beat the dictator

389
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:36,720
yes

390
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,919
this is the great dictator

391
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:40,640
uh

392
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,360
sir charles chaplin

393
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,960
and uh

394
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,880
this is a movie from the 40s if you

395
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,520
don't know it was very predictive movie

396
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,400
anyway

397
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
but natural open questions that we were

398
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,640
asked by many and we already asked

399
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,160
ourselves is

400
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,480
how prevalent is this it's just

401
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,400
are our things are examples or it's real

402
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,799
so the good news is that we realize that

403
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,120
you can embed this anamorphic secrecy

404
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,840
in new ways in new crypto systems in new

405
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,320
places new techniques

406
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,799
and new and other new models so for

407
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:17,919
example

408
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,840
you can do it with rsa you can do it

409
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,559
with goldwater mcalley and tru

410
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,360
uh you can change the model and get it

411
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,840
with more system put it in paella put it

412
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,320
in signatures of uh

413
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,559
of sorts piggyback encryption on other

414
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,960
cryptographic protocols so it's a very

415
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,480
wide

416
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,720
phenomenon using uh

417
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
different techniques

418
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,679
so uh you know once again

419
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,400
the whole world laughs and the dictator

420
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,919
is defeated

421
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,799
so uh

422
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
that's uh that's the day this is the

423
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,320
take so it is indeed uh if somebody

424
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,760
gives you

425
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,400
very bad conditions to

426
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,720
to read your crypto you can

427
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,880
bypass it and this is actually

428
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,520
good news against all those that try to

429
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,559
control

430
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,240
crypto

431
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,360
so

432
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,200
the conclusion is that anamorphic

433
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,799
messages may not hide in plain sight

434
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,159
but they surely hide in cypher site

435
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,400
thank you

436
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,120
hello

437
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,120
uh we i'll be presenting the work of our

438
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,919
team and emmerich sack

439
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,000
amertsec is a

440
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,039
a group by professor hudal khudemi in

441
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,440
nyu and nyuid

442
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,600
our work is on machine learning

443
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,760
framework for randomness purification

444
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,919
and side channel attacks performance

445
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,400
improvement

446
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,880
okay so the research objectives is that

447
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,640
we are using the machine learning

448
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,120
analysis to

449
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,880
further evaluate out fabricated

450
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,080
memerster in our labs uh it's a

451
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,159
fabricated reminiscer of copper hyping

452
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,400
oxide and highly doped silicon

453
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,280
uh we tested this

454
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,480
this is a previously published paper

455
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,559
but for further work we

456
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,400
tested it under machine learning

457
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,640
analysis

458
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,960
and also we used the machine learning

459
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,440
framework to improve the side channel

460
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,559
attacks

461
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,080
efficiencies

462
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,919
through refining the selection of

463
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,880
leakage

464
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,240
model inputs to the training uh models

465
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,320
minimizing the imbalance data sets for

466
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,760
spn and arx

467
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,520
hello

468
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
and also for detecting design elements

469
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,679
changes required to improve certainties

470
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,679
and attacks under study

471
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,760
success rates hence perform a

472
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,720
performance achieved

473
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,520
first i start with the hybrid data

474
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,159
sampling methods and ml based

475
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,760
side channel attacks

476
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,320
uh we are exploiting the leakage and

477
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,919
combining it with the known principles

478
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,039
of cryptographic algorithms for

479
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,280
crypto analytic purposes

480
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,480
machine learning techniques have

481
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,080
improved attack performance and

482
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,640
profiling side channel attack

483
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,120
we investigate deep learning methods

484
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,240
such as mlb and cnn

485
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,120
we also investigate in samples of ml

486
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,360
models to tackle the imbalance

487
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,320
uh here you can see we have used uh

488
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,799
different ins

489
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,280
data sampling methods

490
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,240
we

491
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,760
noticed that in samples need to be

492
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,960
greater than or equal to 10 based

493
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
in samples inherently copes with

494
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,760
imbalance in data addition of noise in

495
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,799
data is in basic and simple uh

496
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,120
improved attack performance and

497
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,159
successful attacks needs only 20 100

498
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,679
sorry 200 traces compared to over 1 000

499
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,320
traces from a single optimized model

500
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
this is a significant

501
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,799
attack performance improvement of 500

502
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,840
percent as you can see here the random

503
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,480
under uh under sample gives an

504
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,559
unacceptable attack performance and we

505
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,480
have haven't used it

506
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,240
the basic and simple and noise and

507
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,400
samples perform better than all the data

508
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,880
sampling techniques

509
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,480
here we're presenting the work of the

510
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,640
machine learning attacks our analysis

511
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,400
done on the memristor-based buff to

512
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
ensure the

513
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
randomness and security of the memristor

514
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,880
based

515
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
fabricated on our labs

516
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,440
as you can see this figure it's

517
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,120
the saturn reset cycles of the

518
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,080
memorizers it for every set and reset

519
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,159
cycle we have a different set and reset

520
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,320
voltage thus a

521
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,760
random uncontrolled output

522
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,240
and this is the model of our fabricated

523
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,640
memberster

524
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
uh here the machine

525
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
here in this figure you can see the in

526
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,919
learning general flow chart we've used

527
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,240
and this is for the logistic regression

528
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,480
uh analysis that we've used here in the

529
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,600
table we have uh

530
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,159
illustrated all the runtime complexities

531
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,440
and the real-time execution

532
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,559
we we used uh we finally tuned hyper

533
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,799
parameters for logistic regression svm

534
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,200
k-means and k-means plus plus

535
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,120
g-m-m random force and x-g boost to uh

536
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
evaluate our

537
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,960
mr buff the membership-based bug to

538
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,320
ensure

539
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,760
its randomness

540
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,640
and as you can see from this table of

541
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,039
results that

542
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,720
the accuracy of the analysis was very

543
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,799
low and also for the roc it was low thus

544
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,120
ensuring the security of our mr buff

545
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,039
and thank you

546
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,559
if you have any questions please send us

547
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,760
on our emails thank you

548
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,480
uh yes hello thank you

549
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,720

yes yes there we go

551
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,039
okay so

552
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,799
i'm afraid we're gonna have to have this

553
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,799
talk again clearly lots of you people

554
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,360
weren't from eurocrypt

555
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,400
while while i appreciate your show of

556
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,760
affection

557
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,320
please refrain from clapping

558
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,400
that's not what we do

559
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,840
if you want to show if you want to show

so and the second thing i wanted to say

564
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,919
is just sorry to everybody i lied to

565
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,200
um i were i didn't mean to lie i really

566
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,000
wasn't planning on holding like a second

567
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
limerick talk this time

568
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,919
but then something really embarrassing

569
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,120
happened

570
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,679
and of course i had to tell you guys

571
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,720
so

572
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,320
without further ado it's just gonna be

573
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,480
this one though short and sweet

574
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,640
uh

575
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,640
yes

576
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,760
there once was this fella from norway

577
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,240
who lived with a self-locking doorway

578
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,919
the shower was good

579
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,000
but there he stood

580
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
half naked and

581
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,360
stuck in the hallway

582
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,080
thank you thank you that's all

583
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,799
yes break

584
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,600
okay everybody uh let's have one more

585
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,520
round of applause and maybe some snaps

586
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,120
for the speakers

587
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,640
and if you can do both at the same time

588
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,440
then you're very talented

589
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,520
yeah wow we all look really stupid doing

590
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,320
that

591
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,840
all right everybody come back in five

592
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,760
minutes we have a five minute break

593
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,710
