1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,920
session if we don't start half an hour

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,919
late um

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,040
so

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,240
welcome to

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,600
the event that everybody has been

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,960
waiting for

7
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,679
uh

8
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,960
for from session

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,280
so

10
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,640
i am nadia

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,840
i'm paul

12
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,760
and your

13
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,560
uh co-chairs

14
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,480
paul is for some reason wearing a hat

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,480
well nadia i'm glad you asked

16
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,760
there's two reasons why i'm wearing this

17
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,679
hat the first is to protect my delicate

18
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,400
skin

19
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,558
from the blinding brilliance of the rum

20
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:33,680
session talks that we're going to have

21
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,640
tonight

22
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,399
uh we have maybe the

23
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,640
best drum session program in the history

24
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,719
of this conference uh or any future

25
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,719
conferences uh the second reason is if

26
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,320
you're a speaker and you need to ask us

27
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,640
something during a break uh you can find

28
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,800
me very effectively because i'm wearing

29
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,559
really an absurd hat that stands out

30
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,960
from the crowd uh so i'm wearing this

31
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,320
ridiculous hat and embarrassing myself

32
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,680
for all of you

33
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,840
why don't you give me a round of

34
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,039
applause right now thank you thank you

35
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,960
really i'm selfless i'm selfless thank

36
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,559
you

37
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,438
okay so we have interstitial slides that

38
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,960
have the name of the talk and the

39
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,080
speaker we will put the first one

40
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,360
up

41
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
um it will look something like this so

42
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,080
if you see your name as next up uh

43
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,000
please make sure that you are ready to

44
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,439
come to the stage

45
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,759
next after the talk the program is

46
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,240
online the the times listed are now a

47
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,280
complete fiction um but we will we will

48
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,040
deal with that so um take a look at the

49
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,119
program online on the website uh if you

50
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,320
want to know what's in store for tonight

51
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,200
so um

52
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,040
announcements uh yeah we're gonna have

53
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,119
we're gonna be having a few remote from

54
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,119
session talks at the very end

55
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,000
um

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,759
uh so look out for those um we're gonna

57
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,759
be having four breaks um they're

58
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,280
probably they're listed as 15 minutes

59
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,720
they're probably not going to be that

60
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,280
time station uh but we will announce the

61
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,680
breaks um and if you are a speaker and

62
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,759
you start to go over time um i have a

63
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,200
little machine that's gonna make a very

64
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,040
annoying noise uh that you're gonna

65
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,799
recognize as being your signal to sort

66
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,560
of uh uh wrap it up uh so

67
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,800
look out for that and as you've seen

68
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,080
physical violence is not out of the

69
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,479
question

70
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,480
so uh can we get our first speakers up

71
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,160
to the stage

72
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,520
and yeah take it away

73
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,120
so thank you uh we at this usually give

74
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
a little update every year so we'll just

75
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,200
run through that real quick mel tim and

76
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,360
i will do that

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,760
so starting off most you are probably

78
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,840
aware of the post quantum crypto

79
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,840
standardization project about a month

80
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,400
ago we announced the

81
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
algorithms that were selected at the end

82
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,920
of round three

83
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,360
so in the

84
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,280
public encryption or chem category we

85
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
selected crystals kyber

86
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
and for digital signatures we selected

87
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,239
crystals dilithium then also falcon and

88
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,840
sphinx plus

89
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,760
we advanced four algorithms to a fourth

90
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,239
round they were all chems bike classic

91
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,400
mcleese hqc and psych

92
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
uh and the words of ward psych was

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,560
discovered to have a disadvantage

94
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,319
recently that its

95
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,720
security might not be as good as hoped

96
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,560
for um

97
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
we did not advance any signatures to the

98
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,480
fourth round because we were going to do

99
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,319
a new call for signatures for post

100
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,159
quantum signatures

101
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:24,959
um

102
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,480
you can read our report for the reasons

103
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,319
and rationale for our decisions and

104
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,480
we've got a great pqc forum if you ever

105
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,480
need entertainment go to the forum

106
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,560
so here's our timeline and what's going

107
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,720
on in the future um

108
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,799
first off we we still anticipate having

109
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,680
the first pqc standards by 2024

110
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,280
that means we will put out a draft we

111
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,440
will get public comments and we hope to

112
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,280
publish them by that time

113
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
we'll hold the workshop on these dates

114
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,200
end of november

115
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,959
start of december it'll be a virtual

116
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,239
workshop

117
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,599
the deadline for submissions for that

118
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
will be september 15th

119
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,519
and the fourth round will continue on

120
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,760
with those four chems being evaluated

121
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,799
and

122
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,560
we will soon have out hopefully by the

123
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,000
end of this month a new call for

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,040
more digital signatures for

125
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,640
complimenting the ones that we already

126
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,878
have

127
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,759
uh luis is going to talk about this in

128
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,880
the next one so i think we can skip this

129
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,360
and i'll

130
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,400
okay the next uh project that we're

131
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,680
going to talk about is the nest

132
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,759
lightweight cryptography project so far

133
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,759
we have 10 finalists

134
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,840
and uh we are hoping to

135
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,000
announce the winner of the

136
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
process by the end of this year

137
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,600
but to give the uh finalists a chance

138
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,240
and an opportunity to provide some

139
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,639
updates so we're gonna ask we are asking

140
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,639
for optional status updates from the

141
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,320
submitters and the

142
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,560
deadline is september 3rd

143
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,160
and uh this is our timeline and

144
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,880
if you break these uh algorithms please

145
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,420
let us know before the uh

146
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,680
[Music]

147
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,199
before we

148
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,840
announce the winning

149
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,800
and another project that we have this

150
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,000
initially started uh officially

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,240
a periodic review of its standards and

152
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,320
guidelines and

153
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,720
we frequently ask for public comments so

154
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,639
if you can check our websites that would

155
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,000
be great and we have one review that i

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,320
want to highlight is about the secure

157
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,639
hash standards that specifies xiaowan

158
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,000
and xiao

159
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,759
we want to disallow

160
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,560
all users of xiaowan including the ones

161
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,800
that requires uh just pre-image

162
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,320
resistance

163
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
and you can check other proposed

164
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
decisions for other standards in our

165
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,479
website

166
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,360
and we have four upcoming standards

167
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,600
and the first one is the digital

168
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,000
signature standard which has been uh in

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
draft form for uh

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,639
for over a year and it just it is in the

171
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,120
final stage of publication

172
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
in 800

173
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,919
108 recommendations for geared key

174
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,319
derivation uh there we have a new

175
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,800
revision coming up that adds kmac base

176
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,680
key key derivation function and for

177
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,240
random number generation we are having

178
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,440
about to publish the third draft of uh

179
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,720
90 c

180
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,440
which proposes two three different uh

181
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
rbg constructions random bit generator

182
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,280
construction and to support this 90

183
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,639
series we're going to have a new

184
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,120
technical report that describes how we

185
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,479
make some of the assumptions

186
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,600
thank you

187
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,440
hello everyone my name is luis i have to

188
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,199
start by saying that i'm a foreign guest

189
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,199
researcher at nist an employee

190
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,440
contractor from strategia

191
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,440
i'm very glad to finally be able to

192
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,599
announce that we will have an upcoming

193
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,000
list call for threshold schemes it will

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,919
be a great exercise for

195
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,759
multi-party computation distributed

196
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,240
systems and other techniques

197
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,680
the scope of this call is um

198
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,680
includes a number of uh

199
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,000
specified primitives namely primitives

200
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,639
that are based on on keys uh these

201
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,199
include signatures like ecdsa at dsa and

202
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,080
rsa this includes public encryption

203
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,560
schemes like rsa as well

204
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,639
aes has a block cipher and also some

205
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,580
primitives in elliptic curve

206
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,680
[Music]

207
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,960
exchange

208
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,039
threshold schemes basically enable the

209
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,240
the

210
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,720
operations of these teams when the

211
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
secret key is shared across multiple

212
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,960
parties

213
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,840
uh so in this upcoming uh call our

214
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,360
intention is to basically create a basis

215
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,160
of schemes submitted by the community

216
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,319
that will allow a period of analysis of

217
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,919
analysis by the public

218
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,319
uh we intend to call for

219
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,400
specifications of system models that

220
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
that make sense for applications in the

221
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,319
real world we intend to call for

222
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,039
security formulations this may include

223
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,120
simulatability setting or game-based

224
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,280
formulations um

225
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,039
the submissions wouldn't call would

226
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,440
include a protocol specification and

227
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,120
also very importantly would include

228
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,039
reference open source implementations

229
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,639
and of course the security analysis that

230
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,879
will prove security we have a high

231
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,319
interest on

232
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,240
modular descriptions and implementations

233
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,599
namely because there are building blocks

234
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,279
that are likely to be usable

235
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,559
across multiple schemes and ideally this

236
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,640
will support us

237
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,479
in formulating future guidelines and

238
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,000
recommending

239
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
a point of interest is that we are not

240
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,480
intending this to be a competition to

241
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,320
select a particular protocol or

242
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,680
standardization

243
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,399
uh just a quick note on some of the

244
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,399
some technical aspects that are of

245
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,399
relevance as we are preparing

246
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,480
uh this call and as we are preparing

247
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,680
criteria

248
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,560
uh one notion of interest is

249
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,480
interchangeability so we are looking for

250
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,399
threshold schemes that can be used as a

251
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,720
drop-in replacement or conventional

252
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,080
schemes

253
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,680
with respect to some subsequent

254
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,600
operations for example with respect to

255
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
signatures we would like a threshold

256
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,320
signature scheme that can be verified by

257
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,519
what is already the conventional

258
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,600
verification algorithm

259
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,880
with respect to that i would like to

260
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,320
call your attention for a particular

261
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,440
report that we have out this past friday

262
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,600
called notem threshold.dsa engineer

263
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,560
signatures it's draft ir

264
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,399
8214b

265
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,959
we have for example an interest

266
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,880
again with respect to signatures on

267
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
strong affordability for example as

268
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,839
compared to regular affordability uh

269
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,760
we've we've there are some

270
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,600
technicalities for example

271
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,519
with regard to criteria on how to

272
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,120
specify

273
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,680
we want to ask some kind of adaptive

274
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,320
security against adaptive corruptions

275
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,000
it's technically challenging to really

276
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,160
formulate what we want considering that

277
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,079
we know some difficulties that exist for

278
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,320
example in the simulatability setting

279
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,839
and of course the implementations that

280
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,920
are going to submitted

281
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,360
they should indeed implement the

282
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,200
threshold scheme so some aspects that

283
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,279
sometimes are left abstract in papers

284
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,279
we're actually going to see how they are

285
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,880
going to be resolved for example how do

286
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,560
parties actually agree on the message to

287
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,399
be signed who are the subsets of

288
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,320
participants that part that are going to

289
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,160
participate in a concurrent setting how

290
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,399
do you define session ids

291
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,399
etc

292
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,880
uh so in conclusion we are aiming for

293
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,959
guidelines and recommendations

294
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,360
we believe that various stakeholders

295
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,519
beyond this community will benefit from

296
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,040
guidelines and recommendations in

297
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,360
particular these could include

298
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,839
the to do's and the two dons so best

299
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,240
practices and pitfalls that we will

300
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,160
likely learn across this process of

301
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,560
analysis we believe this will enhance

302
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,320
our understanding of techniques and and

303
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,760
the rationale for

304
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
for the schemes and we believe this will

305
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
also enhance the access to reference

306
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,920
material by the community by the larger

307
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,160
community

308
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,079
collaboration by the community is

309
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,160
essential if that doesn't happen this

310
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,040
process will will not have effect

311
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,519
please stay tuned we will very soon

312
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,839
possibly still this must announce some

313
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,120
steps for feedback and participation

314
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,880
some timeline was in the previous slide

315
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,200
that wasn't shown let me just point out

316
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,680
that the actual call would likely come

317
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,040
only in early 2023 and before that we

318
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,600
will have a prototype call that will go

319
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,760
out for public comments so you will have

320
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,839
opportunity to say

321
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,519
what do you think make sense respect the

322
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,519
criteria and other aspects

323
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,399
thank you very much for your attention

324
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,480
awesome hi everybody

325
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,000
hi everybody i'm hart unfortunately i am

326
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,839
a terrible singer and i don't have an

327
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,760
exciting cryptocurrency opportunity to

328
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,680
tell you about today

329
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,519
so i'm going to talk about practical

330
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,600
problems motivated by

331
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,440
a little bit of background

332
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,000
i work for the linux foundation which is

333
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,639
essentially a non-profit that hosts

334
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,079
collaborations between companies

335
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,000
you're probably aware

336
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,839
thanks nadia

337
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,519
you're probably aware of the linux

338
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,560
kernel but the lf is huge and behind

339
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,200
some of the most open source uh critical

340
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,680
projects in the world some of which you

341
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,279
probably use every day

342
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,880
don't know about it

343
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
um so just to give you an idea of the

344
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,399
scale uh

345
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,560
even the blockchain stuff that i work on

346
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,720
you know has a huge amount of

347
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,320
contributors

348
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,200
code and just a lot of stuff going on so

349
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,040
the main point i think is that you know

350
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,639
we see a lot of people

351
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,279
and companies uh implement cryptography

352
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,440
and cryptographic applications

353
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,120
and so you know we get a really good

354
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,519
picture of what people are doing

355
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,279
and so today very briefly what i wanted

356
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,320
to talk about is what cryptography or

357
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,399
cryptographic adjacent technologies have

358
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,480
received sort of you know a really big

359
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,920
push

360
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
and interest from industry but very

361
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,200
little research from the academic

362
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,480
community and i think these are really

363
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,120
interesting spaces for future research

364
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,560
so one thing that i want to talk about

365
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,040
today is called self-sovereign identity

366
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,320
people familiar with this have people

367
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,399
seen it

368
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,000
a few people

369
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
awesome so

370
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,360
vaguely speaking it's a term used to

371
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,240
describe the concept that an individual

372
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,839
should own and control their identity

373
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,600
without sort of intervening

374
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,279
administrative authorities if you want

375
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,120
to prove something or show something

376
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,800
about yourself you can do it directly

377
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,639
this is really popular i mean even the

378
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,800
government of british columbia has a

379
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,279
platform for registering and managing

380
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,880
business licenses

381
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,320
uh they care enough to have several

382
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,160
government employees working as

383
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,760
full-time open source maintainers which

384
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,680
i think is really cool

385
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,000
and if we go back to the hype diagram

386
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,360
which was

387
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,519
mentioned in the keynote yesterday

388
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,000
you know decentralized identity uh is

389
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,839
really hot right now

390
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,720
um

391
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,800
it's a very complicated ecosystem there

392
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,040
are a lot of difficult concepts

393
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,639
and there are lots of tricky crypto

394
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,279
problems to be solved so lots of things

395
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,880
in zero knowledge proofs

396
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,360
uh lots of things about privacy and you

397
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,519
know how to avoid correlation between

398
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,720
different times when you use your

399
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,160
credentials

400
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,839
and the problems here may be solved in

401
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,040
theory

402
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,480
but they still need theoretical

403
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,120
advancements in order for many use cases

404
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
to be practiced

405
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,199
there's already a huge community around

406
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,920
self-sovereign identity uh hundreds of

407
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,760
people attend these biannual workshops

408
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,959
there's a huge amount of people that

409
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,560
want to build this they want to develop

410
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,360
this

411
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,720
and at the last iw workshop that i

412
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,760
attended

413
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,079
there was only one rather mediocre

414
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,959
photographer that attended

415
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,639
and as you might imagine this has sort

416
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,800
of caused huge amounts of problems for

417
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,880
the space so this is

418
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,720
an excerpt from dan's paper i think i

419
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
saw him sitting over there

420
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
but sort of

421
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,839
having your system be vulnerable to a

422
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,240
bls rogue public key attack is sort of a

423
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,720
rite of passage in space

424
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,399
we've seen it and we'll probably see it

425
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,839
again

426
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,720
uh

427
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,519
what is privacy defining privacy can be

428
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,120
hard for experts in the best of

429
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,199
circumstances and in these credential

430
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,040
systems well we're not even going to get

431
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,199
there this is of course assuming that

432
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,759
you actually define privacy or know that

433
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,199
it should be defined

434
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,600
uh and in practice we tend to see what i

435
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,399
call the uh patch's o houlihan

436
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,720
cryptographic strategy which is kind of

437
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,639
just to throw tools at the problem until

438
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,279
people stop bothering you about it

439
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,360
uh so what does this mean for you you

440
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,959
know if you think about these problems

441
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,639
there are lots of opportunities to do

442
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,680
research with a big and practical impact

443
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,120
uh and there are lots of other problems

444
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,680
with similar issues too

445
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,720
interoperability is one

446
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,519
uh consensus is another one there's you

447
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,519
know excellent work five members of this

448
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,040
community i'm sure you're in the

449
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,639
audience today

450
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,639
but there seems to be this attitude in

451
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,480
industry that well you told me not to

452
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,920
roll my own crypto but you didn't tell

453
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,079
me not to roll my own consensus on

454
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,079
uh and of course anything related to key

455
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,360
and data

456
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,680
uh so on that note you know i'm done and

457
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,759
i hope uh there are funnier rump session

458
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,279
talks in the future thank you for your

459
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,519
time

460
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
hello everyone

461
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,199
my name is daniel and because this talk

462
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,639
some people are

463
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,399
with me in

464
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,720
soon i hope they can turn another video

465
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,120
for this

466
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,959
okay they leave me alone okay that's

467
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,359
good

468
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,520
so we see sofia and i know we also have

469
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,640
a couple of us so we want to introduce

470
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,160
so they they can see you in these guys

471
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,400
uh we want to introduce crypto latino

472
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
which is a group that advocates for

473
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,240
cryptography research made by and for

474
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,160
latin americans

475
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,520
um

476
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,079
so what are we we are a community of

477
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,319
latin american cryptographers and we

478
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,160
want to strengthen the community the

479
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
community of latin americans working in

480
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,720
cryptography and also help students and

481
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,880
people who want to get into the field

482
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,640
we want to do research that is unique to

483
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,400
a region and we also want to contribute

484
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,840
and help back in different ways

485
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,520
now who are we we are a a group of pgs

486
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,400
phd students post docs professors and in

487
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,039
general researchers from the area

488
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,280
and we have a working group we've been

489
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,000
meeting regularly over slack

490
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,360
since october 2020 we hold as of today

491
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,559
regular meetings bi-weekly and we also

492
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,960
ran a successful workshop last year

493
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,640
where we got the community

494
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,080
from latin america together and we got

495
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,400
to show some of our work to students and

496
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,000
also people who want to get involved

497
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,100
this is a

498
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,400
[Music]

499
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,120
a small overview of the main team who

500
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,360
meet regularly

501
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,799
a lot of names among them we have

502
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,280
researchers postdocs even professors and

503
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,440
and people in both industry and academia

504
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,679
and it's more than that in our group we

505
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,480
have about 80 people and we have like a

506
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,200
list of what people are researching on

507
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,880
what their interests are

508
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,559
and we try to keep track of each other

509
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,080
and know where the community is

510
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,039
so where are we at the moment so i am

511
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,679
here but as you can see sophia abdel

512
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,919
octavio they're not here with us

513
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,840
and this is because even though

514
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,960
some of

515
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,200
a lot of us had accepted papers they

516
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,640
couldn't make it

517
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,039
and it has to do with things that are

518
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,440
related to costs of coming but also

519
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,799
visas

520
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,640
and to get into that i want to mention

521
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,520
that

522
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,280
this is the map of countries that don't

523
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,400
need a visa

524
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,480
to come to the us

525
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,000
and well the whole latin america

526
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,039
basically

527
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:17,840
is

528
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,360
we require visas and this is not a

529
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,200
problem unique to us there are a lot of

530
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,280
nationalities that suffer from the same

531
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,559
and just to give you an idea about how

532
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,760
bad this is

533
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,919
this is the waiting time in in the

534
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,160
consulate in bogota to get a visa we're

535
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,840
talking about a period of two years and

536
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,919
this is not a joke

537
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,640
i'm sorry for being like so

538
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,400
the bring bad news but like this is a

539
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,000
this is a real thing so we are not here

540
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,679
because of this but this is the type of

541
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,200
things we want to advocate for so what

542
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,960
do we do in our group we want to say to

543
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,480
promote students

544
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,160
make researches from the region more

545
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,360
visible

546
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,600
we want to create resources in languages

547
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,039
like spanish and portuguese that can

548
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,880
help people who perhaps don't have a

549
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,160
good english level get into the

550
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,679
community

551
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,880
we want to

552
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
create events like the workshop we

553
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,360
already ran last year that hopefully

554
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,200
give us more visibility and give better

555
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,600
opportunities to prospect students

556
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,200
and also in general we want to build a

557
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,640
network that is good for international

558
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,400
researchers to reach to in case they

559
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,039
want to build talent and to get

560
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,559
students and other participants from

561
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,880
different regions of the world

562
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,720
and in general you can get information

563
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,960
about the region in these resources we

564
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,880
want to build

565
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,640
finally how can you get involved as a

566
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
community we have a twitter that will

567
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
keep it quite active where we show

568
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,559
different works that we have and similar

569
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,480
resources and also we have a website

570
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,880
where we post regularly and everything a

571
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,000
lot of things are still under

572
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,200
construction

573
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,880
but we indeed have some resources to

574
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,840
show

575
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,720
now we plan to build more summer schools

576
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,559
workshops and things we want to invite

577
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,159
you and hopefully you can attend and

578
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,520
join us

579
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,000
and finally please be more aware of

580
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
these type of problems that's the first

581
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,559
way you can contribute and help us raise

582
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,400
awareness about it

583
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,520
on this i want to thank you

584
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,880
thanks

585
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,080
okay

586
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,960
um

587
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,799
thank you speakers please use the

588
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,799
handheld mic

589
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,480
huh is it okay

590
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,440
yeah

591
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,720
great

592
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,240
it's not okay

593
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,640
[Laughter]

594
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,240
it's fine it's just the speaker should

595
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,760
use the handheld mic

596
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,039
okay great

597
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,520
um thank you for that

598
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,360
by the way the the visa problem is

599
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,240
really important so um i think i second

600
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,600
that like we should spend some time

601
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,039
thinking about that as a community so

602
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,039
thanks for bringing that up

603
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,760
um i am here to talk to you briefly um

604
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,200
about universally composable

605
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,880
non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of

606
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,480
knowledge

607
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,200
from sigma protocols in the global

608
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,600
random oracle models um and this is

609
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,559
joint work with analysanskaia starring

610
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,880
straight line compilers so here you can

611
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,400
see our

612
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,120
handy xtractomatic 5000 which takes a

613
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,600
proof as input produces a witness as

614
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,320
output with none of that pesky rewinding

615
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,640
we have two different versions of the

616
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,720
global random oracle the observable

617
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,159
version and the programmable version and

618
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,720
or protocols which allow me to either

619
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,280
prove that i know how to get uc nizik's

620
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,600
or i know some magical trapdoor in the

621
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,039
sky

622
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,360
so before we get into the results uh you

623
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,280
might be asking why should i care about

624
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,840
this problem

625
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,640
well we have all of these nice protocols

626
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,120
that are based on zero-knowledge proofs

627
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,720
uh-huh

628
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
and they have proofs of security in the

629
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,679
random oracle model yup

630
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,080
so naturally you might be saying well

631
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
these seem pretty useful we should use

632
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,600
them in practice makes sense to me

633
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,720
however

634
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,559
realistic settings such as parallel

635
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,799
composition and sharing a common setup

636
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,960
are very tricky

637
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,799
so this is where you run into problems

638
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,799
with rewinding and forking and

639
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,400
difficulties in writing the proof so

640
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,640
that's a theoretical problem and there

641
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,480
are corresponding practical attacks on

642
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,799
these systems like the ros attack that

643
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,200
will allow provers to forge proofs so

644
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,039
that's not so great

645
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,880
but we can solve those problems and make

646
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,200
our lives a lot easier using universally

647
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,039
composable proofs in the global random

648
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,200
oracle model

649
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,480
so we show

650
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,039
first to draw an implication between uc

651
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,640
proofs and some properties that you

652
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,320
might expect them to have such as

653
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,720
completeness the non-interactive version

654
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,000
of zero knowledge and the

655
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,919
non-interactive version of simulation

656
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,679
soundness and it turns out these

657
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,440
properties are attainable using a

658
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,279
straight-line compiler

659
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,720
so

660
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,679
we can take uh any sigma protocol almost

661
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,400
any sigma protocol as input

662
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,240
to the straight line compiler run it

663
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,440
through and get a uc proof as output in

664
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,600
the programmable global random oracle

665
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,840
model now if you're not okay with

666
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,320
programming your global random oracle we

667
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,440
also have a construction in the

668
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,799
non-programmable version

669
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,720
which takes a straight-line compiler

670
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,760
again and also additionally a crs over a

671
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,679
sampleable hard relation

672
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,360
and then you get a you see proof of an

673
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,760
or statement in the observable

674
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,880
non-programmable model

675
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,559
so what are some takeaways from this

676
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,279
work um straight line extraction seems

677
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,200
pretty useful and i actually saw it used

678
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,799
a few times today so that was really

679
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,760
nice

680
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,799
um not only for the uc model but also in

681
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,120
the quantum random oracle model because

682
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,640
rewinding is tricky there because of the

683
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,559
no cloning theorem

684
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,200
and just it will make our lives simpler

685
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,480
and easier when we're trying to prove

686
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,000
things so we don't have to rewind

687
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,360
anymore

688
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,679
second the global random oracle model is

689
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,360
weirder than usual

690
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,279
um there are some weird session based

691
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,520
privileges in there that come up so if

692
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,960
you are interested in talking about

693
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,559
either of these things i would love to

694
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,600
talk to you

695
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,760
and if you want to check out our work

696
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,080
you can look at the eprint thanks so

697
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,080
much

698
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,520
hello is this the right microphone

699
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,918
awesome

700
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,559
uh let's see how do i advance side

701
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,640
arrows spacebar ah here we go

702
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,120
all right the lll algorithm we all know

703
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,279
it we all love it it's fast used

704
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,720
everywhere there's a gazillion

705
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
implementations c plus plus rust there's

706
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,320
even a hardware implementation that

707
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,240
someone put on an asic for eight by

708
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,200
eight matrices doing lol on those

709
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,279
but what if you want the

710
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,440
algorithmic efficiency of the celebrated

711
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,880
ll algorithm

712
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,480
combined with the

713
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,400
readability maintainability and

714
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
usability that you can only get

715
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,240
from a several hundred line shell script

716
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,039
introducing shell hello

717
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,840
the world's first and probably last pure

718
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,240
bash implementation of the lll algorithm

719
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,720
now when i say pure bash what exactly do

720
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,279
i mean i mean no said no tr no ock uh

721
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,400
certainly no python this is entirely

722
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,880
with shell built-ins

723
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,720
so you don't need any pesky execs

724
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,080
anywhere

725
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,320
uh what do we have implemented we have

726
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,880
gram-schmidt orthogonalization uh we

727
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,440
have projection we do not yet have ll it

728
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,400
is work in progress

729
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,039
we're nearly there so

730
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,880
let's let's do a demo because this is

731
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,559
after all the rum session

732
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,159
uh we're going to do branch

733
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,520
orthogonalization on the following

734
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,720
matrix that i'm sure all of you

735
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,919
recognize

736
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:16,799
uh

737
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,080
and so

738
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,240
the submissions had to be in pdf format

739
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,720
pdfs don't have arbitrary code execution

740
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,000
except when you don't want them to have

741
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
arbitrary code execution

742
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,679
uh so we're going to pretend a little

743
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,600
bit but i promise you this actually does

744
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,120
work in a terminal

745
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
uh so this is a

746
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,520
shell script after all so we can just

747
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,600
source it rather than running it and now

748
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,520
we have some handy functions available

749
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,919
to us such as gram schmidt

750
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,159
we're going to enter in one vector per

751
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,240
line separated by commas

752
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,640
and voila we have what i'm sure all of

753
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,200
you can immediately verify in your head

754
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,240
as the correct gram-schmidt

755
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,840
orthogonalization

756
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,919
uh now what's going on with these colons

757
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,240
here uh there is exactly one numeric

758
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,039
type in bash which is the signed long

759
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,720
we don't have any floats these are

760
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,799
rational numbers the first

761
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,640
uh thing separated by a colon is the

762
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,360
denominator

763
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,279
so where do we go from here

764
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,640
uh well we need to finish the

765
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,080
implementation we have gram-free

766
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,840
orthogonalization working we just need

767
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,240
nearest plane and that's basically all

768
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
you need for ll so we're most of the way

769
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,120
there

770
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,440
uh there are a lot of bugs though uh in

771
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,520
the partially implemented nearest plane

772
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,480
uh

773
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,039
we don't have big ants or big rationals

774
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,000
so again signed longs anything larger

775
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,320
than the 5x5 matrix you saw likely to

776
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,080
cause overflows and of course this is

777
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,840
bash so there is almost certainly

778
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,399
arbitrary code execution everywhere

779
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,880
uh and this does use some bash specific

780
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,200
features such as array variables be nice

781
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
to get rid of those so we could be uh

782
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,159
work on posix standard sh

783
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,279
um maybe pearl or cobala

784
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,600
sent to some other languages

785
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,440
there are also a few open questions uh

786
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,039
first and foremost do we have too many

787
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,120
or too few l's

788
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,720
um and of course the largest question of

789
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,399
all is why on earth would anyone

790
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,760
implement this

791
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,200
uh however if you are interested in

792
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,279
helping with implementation uh feel free

793
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,840
to get in touch thank you so much
