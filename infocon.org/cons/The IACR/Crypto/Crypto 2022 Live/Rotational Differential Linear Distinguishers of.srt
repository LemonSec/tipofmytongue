2
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,960
yes you should share your screen and

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,238
start speaking

4
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,040
okay okay okay

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,079
it's very hard for us to hear the

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,680
introduction by this session share

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,800
can share

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,399
yes go ahead

9
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,360
okay

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,079
now

11
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,440
uh

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,960
may i

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,079
continue to speaking

14
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,120
yes

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,440
okay okay

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,680
okay

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,560
this is the presentation of our paper

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,479
rotational differential linear

19
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,840
distinctions of acceptors with actually

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,479
output linear masks

21
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,280
and don't forget this is the joint work

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,960
with switzer

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,320
yuvalu and charlie

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
differential and the linear group

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,280
analysis are the most general measure to

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
analyze block cipher

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,759
there are some combined varieties

28
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,759
including boron

29
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,320
differential linear and rotational

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,840
differential linear

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,159
and the differential linear can be

32
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,880
considered as a special cases of

33
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,600
rotational differential linear in this

34
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,799
talk we will focus on potential

35
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,759
different linear and the special cases

36
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,520
differential linear

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,560
for vectorial boolean function giving

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,960
the rotational input difference data

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,759
output mass gamma we can build a

40
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,680
rotational differential linear

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,200
distinctions by a linear approximation

42
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,519
on rotational output difference

43
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,239
and the correlation is defined as a

44
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,319
number of pairs with

45
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,840
linear approximation equal to zero minus

46
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,239
the number of pairs with linear

47
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,640
approximation equal to one

48
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,840
and the problem is how to estimate the

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,640
third correlation

50
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,280
uh often we divide the

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,200
cipher in two parts

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,920
for the first parts we have a rotational

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,360
differential

54
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,480
trio with probability p

55
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,800
for the second part we have two linear

56
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,280
trials with base epsilon and epsilon

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,400
prime

58
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
and the correlation of rotational

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,280
differential linear distinctions is

60
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,959
estimated as four times p times epsilon

61
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,879
times epsilon prime

62
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,680
but this method may not be accurate

63
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,440
for differential linear group analysis

64
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
the differential linear connective

65
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,239
people was proposed to accurately

66
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,120
compute the correlation of differential

67
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,959
linear distinctions

68
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,080
and later as crypto

69
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,599
2021

70
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,879
another method was proposed to compute

71
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,440
the correlation of differential linear

72
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,720
distinction from algebraic points

73
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,519
and thus about to measure is only

74
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,360
applicable for the s pin cipher not for

75
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,120
the acceptor

76
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,840
and for rotational differential linear

77
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,840
analysis movis case technique is adopted

78
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,640
to compute

79
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,400
to compute the correlation of rotational

80
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,599
differential linear distinctions however

81
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,959
the main problem is that is applicable

82
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,159
for the output mask with handwritten one

83
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,760
about the motivation first the

84
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,400
modulation is a co component

85
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,839
for x cipher some properties must be

86
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,478
clarified such as the correlation of

87
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,040
rotational differential linear or

88
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,199
differential linear

89
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,320
second

90
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,520
for the x acceptor differential linear

91
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,080
probe analysis is one of the most

92
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,880
powerful methods computing the

93
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,960
correlation of differential linear

94
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,199
distinction for x cipher is attractive

95
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,840
now in this paper we will solve the two

96
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,120
problems first for actually output

97
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,080
linear max how to accurately calculate

98
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,600
the rotational

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,000
differential linear or differential

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
linear

101
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,960
the rotational div

102
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,360
first for the modulation

103
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,000
in this part we will show the two

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,680
problems first for arbitrary output

105
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,880
linear masks how to accurately calculate

106
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,039
the rotational different linear or

107
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,919
diffusion linear correlation of modular

108
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,960
addition in phenomenal time

109
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,840
and

110
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,800
second

111
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
for arbitrary output linear maps and we

112
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,520
evaluate the rotational different linear

113
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,039
correlation of x acceptance

114
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,759
and for the

115
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,199
and for the modulation the definition of

116
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,440
rotational differential linear or

117
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,000
differential linear correlation are

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,680
exhibited in this page as a linear

119
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,319
approximation are rotational output

120
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,600
difference

121
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,039
or output difference

122
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,720
however for the modular addition there

123
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,520
is no phenomenal time to

124
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,080
there is no phenomenal time out there to

125
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,120
compute the correlation of differential

126
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,319
linear or rotational different linear

127
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,840
in practice the modulation of the

128
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,319
operator on large words

129
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,319
unlike xbox

130
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,720

132
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,960
input pairs is inflexible

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,199
and the

134
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,840
european 2021

135
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,039
a formula is given as to efficiently

136
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,000
compute the correlation of differential

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,360
linear and

138
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,840
rotational differential linear for

139
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
modular addition

140
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,639
however there are some constituents the

141
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,280
formula is only applicable for the

142
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
output mask with 100 1

143
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,120
and for rotational differential

144
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
or linear is adopted certain

145
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,919
statistical assumptions which may give

146
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,840
rise to some inaccurate results

147
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,520
in order to overcome the problem

148
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,319
first we purpose the partition schemes

149
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,039
of the overall input space

150
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,479
based r8 for modular addition we give a

151
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,039
formula that can compute the exact

152
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,759
correlation of arbitrary

153
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,319
differential linear distinctions of the

154
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,000
rotational differential linear

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,240
distinctions in phenomenal time

156
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
and first for the differential linear

157
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,680
distinctions of modular addition we give

158
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,319
a formula that can efficiently compute

159
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,759
the exact correlation with arbitrary

160
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,319
output linear masks

161
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,199
the exact correlation can be a

162
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,560
can be obtained by a row vector one one

163
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,080
one multiply a series uh matrix g

164
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,759
multiplication and then multiply a

165
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,199
column vector one zero zero zero

166
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,319
uh where the chain is constructed by

167
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,199
these 8 metrics

168
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,039
from right to

169
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,639
left

170
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,039
each matrix is generated by the

171
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,199
corresponding piece of

172
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,160
input difference and output mask for

173
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,080

176
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,279
input difference are 0 1

177
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,399
and the

178
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,240
i speed of output max is one then we

179
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,919
choose the matrix m011

180
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,519
for rotational differential linear

181
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,240
distinctions of modular addition we

182
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,959
adopt some additional technique and we

183
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,040
can get a similar result

184
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,080
some details is existed in our paper

185
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,560
and for rotational differential linear

186
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,519
distinctions of modular addition we do a

187
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,240
comparison with solute formula since the

188
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,959
result of our formula is exact

189
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,839
correlation we can find that this

190
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,399
formula is an accuracy

191
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,279
in some cases

192
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,040
next we will consider how to compute the

193
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,760
rotational different linear or

194
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,080
differential linear correlation of

195
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,080
acceptors

196
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,839
euphrates 2021 the moviski's technique

197
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,800
adapted to compute the rotational

198
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
differential linear

199
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,399
correlation

200
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,680
it can be summarized as two rules first

201
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,480
for each piece the probability

202
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,000
distribution of rotational difference is

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,360
special cases of rotational differential

204
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,079
linear and second the probability

205
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,800
distribution of rotational output

206
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,760
difference can be evaluated by

207
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
the pro

208
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,560
probability distribution of rotational

209
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,240
input difference

210
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,120
according about two rods for output mass

211
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,399
mask with hand with one a method to

212
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,200
evaluate the correlation of rotational

213
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,440
different linear or differential linear

214
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,720
of x effort is proposed

215
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,160
but for

216
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,800
arbitrary rotational different linear

217
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
distinctions or differential linear

218
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,240
distinctions how to evaluate is

219
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,880
correlation

220
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,160
for any function s the correlation of

221
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,480
arbitrary rotational different linear

222
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,600
distinctions can be evaluated by

223
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,440
the distribution

224
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,279
of rotational input difference it can it

225
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,480
has us

226
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,079
the same it's it has the same form with

227
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,839
operation

228
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,920
it has a symbol with

229
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,600
with operation two

230
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,959
and then

231
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,880
combined with

232
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,040
with private theorem

233
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,320
for modulation if we guess the property

234
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,880
distribution of rotational input

235
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,279

236
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,279
the correlation of arbitrary

differential linear distribution

238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,640
distinctions can be evaluated

239
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,959
by the following theorem

240
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,240
the form of the formula is similar to

241
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,399
the prior theorem and the matrix can be

242
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,000
generated by

243
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,360
exception

244
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,920
of four matrix according to the

245
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,320
corresponding

246
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,480

difference

248
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,200
and for rotational differential linear

249
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,959
distributions we

250
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,399
get a similar result

251
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,680
some details about these two algorithms

252
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,560
can be obtained or can be obtained from

253
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,359
our paper

254
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
unlike the

255
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,680
previous result in your 2021 for the

256

257
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,920

if it's communicated with rotational

262
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,000

269
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,440
of l multiplies the lambda it means that

270
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,920
we only need to consider the

271
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,279

274
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,480
and then for except for it can be

275
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,440
considered the interrupt introduction of

more viscose technique for acceptor is

279
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,720
exhibited in the following

280
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,120
and we apply it on

281
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,480
around reduced object subhash

282
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,720
chatter and spec

283
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,920
we get a series of practical

284
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,760
distinguishers we summaried on the table

285
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,800
for foreign asset we get a distinction

286
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,600
with correlation one and we get a better

287

eight nine

293
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,480

295
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,600
much better than previous results

296
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,279
in summary

297
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,399
our people do this reason first for

298
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,360

completely

300
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,440
that can compute the exact correlation

301
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,000
of arbitrary differential linear

302
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,440

305
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,680
second we completely generalized more

306
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,920
whiskey's technique and gave a new

307
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,959
measure to estimate the correlation of

and second

313
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,000
we apply it
