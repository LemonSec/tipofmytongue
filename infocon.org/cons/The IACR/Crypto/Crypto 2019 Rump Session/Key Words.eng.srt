1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,500
yes if you are an author of a paper that

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,180
you're submitting to an IAC our event

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,299
you need to know what your keyword

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,369
should be and being the archivist I

5
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,890
thought I would try to do some sort of

6
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,859
word analysis and see how it might help

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,590
the ICR it might help understand

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:30,420
something about the events so for

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:33,989
example crypto 2016 use these words the

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:37,110
size of the font is proportional to the

11
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,930
importance of the word so it's really

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,790
not very surprising that security and

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,940
key and function and scheme and input

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:48,390
and output are there in the small print

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:55,470
you'll find Alice and Bob and several

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:58,049
other people but it's I so I thought is

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,379
this going to vary over time is it going

18
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:06,900
to vary over events what do words tell

19
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:11,820
us so let's take a different event

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:14,130
yura crypt euro crypt uses but same

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,889
words in about the same proportion

22
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,899
there's no surprise since you know

23
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:27,660
crypto and Europe crypt are kind of of

24
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:29,400
twins random is important so let's go on

25
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,039
to Asia crypt I thought Asia crypt had a

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,980
slightly different genetic bent to it

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,230
but it doesn't really it uses the same

28
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:41,130
words so it's as though there really is

29
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:43,290
one vocabulary for cryptography it was

30
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,970
established long ago and really the same

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,370
words get used over and over and about

32
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,550
the same proportions at least in these

33
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,979
three major events I had expected to

34
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,649
find variation over time which was what

35
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,729
I found when I did this analysis for the

36
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:01,680
security and privacy conference but no

37
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:03,658
maybe the topics do change and maybe

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,120
you'll find down in the smallest words

39
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:11,480
you know oblivious and things creep in

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:16,110
but the big words remain the big words

41
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:18,630
pkc pkc uses the same words but it has a

42
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:22,320
narrower range of importance

43
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,240
so it just loves scheme and I love

44
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:29,280
signature - okay that's not very

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,290
surprising Chaz we begin to see

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,270
something different here

47
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:41,850
Chaz likes the same words as as the the

48
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:44,490
others but Chaz is about attack so

49
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:49,710
attack implementation algorithm very

50
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:51,780
important here FSE the same thing so FSA

51
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:56,330
and Chaz seem to be a cluster they're

52
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,710
cousins to the the other four events

53
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,630
tsetse I thought I would see some

54
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,060
differences there there really is a

55
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:08,430
difference in balance on important words

56
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:12,900
but still it's kind of the same things

57
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:16,290
and again not varying much over time so

58
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,060
one way to visualize this is I took all

59
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,120
the words that are important for crypto

60
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,010
and put them in dark blue and then words

61
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,260
that are distinguishers for other

62
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:30,780
conferences are in different colors so

63
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:34,109
you can see that Chaz likes

64
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:38,160
implementation and there are some other

65
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:40,800
clusters polynomial not that popular in

66
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,010
crypto but it is favored by other

67
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,740
conferences and parameter and element

68
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,480
are our sort of distinguishers another

69
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,950
way to look at this is what I call a

70
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,690
word chromosomes so in this bar graph we

71
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:58,440
have the most important words in the

72
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,870
conference's and the the color the size

73
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,359
of the color of the bar indicates how

74
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,810
important the word is and this does

75
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,820
clarify FSA in chess which are at the

76
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:14,090
top and the dark red and orange

77
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:17,099
they really do use different words and

78
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:19,858
but you know TCC comes in there and it

79
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,830
distinguishes itself in a couple of ways

80
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:26,039
so if you were writing an I ACR paper

81
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,080
you must use the word key prominently

82
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,160
otherwise they might say maybe you

83
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,080
should submit this to a different

84
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,990
conference if you are writing a

85
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,560
Chaz or FSC paper you will have to say

86
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,780
attack it implementation otherwise they

87
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,670
might say submit this somewhere else and

88
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,109
if you want to distinguish yourself from

89
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,970
crypto because you didn't want to be a

90
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:50,800
crypto paper and then put in polynomial

91
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:55,000
or round round is is also an odd word so

92
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,240
what can we do with this scientific

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,630
information here the I ACR I believe has

94
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,030
really an unfortunate acronym I don't

95
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:07,240
think it's very interesting so we ought

96
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:10,840
to be able to use this analysis to get a

97
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,280
better acronym for the IAC are something

98
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,729
that's keyword based and has a

99
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,460
meaningful presentation so input is one

100
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:21,210
of our most important words so let's

101
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:25,330
start with an I just the way it does now

102
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:29,560
he he is a keyword it is the most

103
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:32,080
important keyword encryption very

104
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,620
important let's finish off with

105
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:40,140
algorithm and we have the perfect name

106
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:44,079
for the IAC are IKEA

107
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,079
