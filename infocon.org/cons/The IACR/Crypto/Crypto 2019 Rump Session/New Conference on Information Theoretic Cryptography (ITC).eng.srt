1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,379
all right I don't think I've time to

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,900
read all of them so I'm just gonna go

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:14,019
ahead so I'm here to announce the birth

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:17,230
of a new conference called ITC or

5
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:18,970
information theoretic cryptography so

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,850
there's a conference that's dedicated to

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,099
studying to also studying

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,650
security for computationally unbounded

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,609
adversary so either techniques that deal

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,979
with computational and bounded

11
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:31,510
adversaries or security properties that

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,059
that can handle computationally

13
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,830
unbounded adversaries we really think

14
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:37,149
about this in a very broad sense so any

15
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,190
work that has some interesting

16
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:41,220
information tharok component even if the

17
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:45,820
result Finder is as computational is

18
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,550
definitely open we're interested so the

19
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:52,000
the first conference will be held in

20
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:55,180
2020 in Boston and thus in June and the

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,710
submission is on December 16th I really

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,860
encourage you to submit your best work

23
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:01,960
and come and attend the conference just

24
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,680
a little bit more information so here's

25
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,190
some topics example topics that

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,680
appropriate that we're looking for

27
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,440
things like randomest extraction privacy

28
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,179
amplification secret sharing private

29
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,899
information retrieval locally decodable

30
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:21,280
codes party computation proof systems

31
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:23,770
etc here's the steering committee which

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,470
is also the set of authors on the talks

33
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:29,199
you can see it on the printed sheet and

34
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,569
I said before I see sea 2020 will be in

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,630
Boston I'm the program chair and the L

36
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:35,380
and M are the journal chairs and one

37
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,759
thing I won't tell you about the

38
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,750
conference the the structure of the

39
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,410
conference the program will actually

40
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:45,220
consists of two tracks so there's the

41
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:47,200
usual conference conference paper track

42
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,030
which will consist of accepted papers

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,440
there will be published in Proceedings

44
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,179
of the usual thing that you expect

45
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,750
conferences but in addition we'll have a

46
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:57,369
lot of invited talks that are meant to

47
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,590
represent the greatest hits' results in

48
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,729
the area and these will be selected by

49
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,479
the program committee but we're

50
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:05,709
encouraging the community to nominate

51
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,348
topics the nominee results for the

52
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:10,970
greatest hits' talk so please send in

53
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:16,579
your nominations as all you

54
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,580
[Applause]
