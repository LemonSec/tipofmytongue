1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:11,200
good evening everyone thank you so much

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:15,519
for letting me present as a small talk

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:19,020
he invites you to join International

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,570
Olympic in cryptography and SEO crypto

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,730
five years ago we started this Olympus

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,490
is a small competition that was devoted

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:31,920
to mathematical problems in cryptography

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:34,480
and now it has more than thousand

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:40,899
participants from all over the world and

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:43,360
a great program committee yeah a limpet

11
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:49,090
consists of two independent internet

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:53,440
rounds the first one is individual it's

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:57,670
quite short and it consists of mostly

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:01,539
theoretical tasks the second one lasts

15
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:03,789
for one week it has a lot of hard

16
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:08,110
problems and you can participate in it

17
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:11,649
alone or with your team and everybody

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:15,060
could participate school and university

19
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:21,250
students postdocs or professors

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:24,700
literally everyone yeah during these

21
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:30,039
years we had a lot of different tasks

22
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:34,179
for example fun tasks for school

23
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:38,280
students some tasks where you need to

24
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:43,030
break cipher from a picture or

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:47,679
historical one of course we offer a lot

26
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:52,110
of mathematical problems and tasks for

27
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:55,179
your programming skills some online

28
00:01:52,110 --> 00:02:01,149
cipher machines that await you to break

29
00:01:55,179 --> 00:02:06,090
them and even unsolved problems that

30
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:10,270
sometimes are solved during a limpid so

31
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:14,390
save the date we invite you to join us

32
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:18,440
as usual more details can be found on

33
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:21,320
our website and also I will leave some

34
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,980
posters over there thank you so much

35
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,480
thank you
