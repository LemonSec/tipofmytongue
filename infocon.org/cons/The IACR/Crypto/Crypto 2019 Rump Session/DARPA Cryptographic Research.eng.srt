1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,480
yeah hi everyone because it's like 10:30

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,590
at night and all we want to talk about

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,219
is what is it I've been doing in

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:15,230
cryptography so why not okay so hi I'm

5
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:18,020
Joshua a program manager at DARPA I run

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,350
DARPA s cryptographic programs there are

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,520
quite a number of them at this point so

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,860
there's a program called safer which

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,540
just ended this year on

10
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,669
indistinguishability obfuscation I'll

11
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,460
just leave that one there so Brandeis

12
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:34,219
ends next year from a cryptographic

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,649
standpoint it's focused on among other

14
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:38,690
things kind of MPC with low party so

15
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:40,129
like counter fewer and moderate

16
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,050
complexity computation but like

17
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:43,730
practical applications so as an example

18
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,730
I roll a crypto we talked about like

19
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,800
assigning ships to ports in like a

20
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,390
couple of seconds where you didn't want

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,309
to reveal the underlying ship locations

22
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,780
or their speeds we're doing a lot of

23
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:56,300
stuff involving like information do you

24
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,159
confliction it's fun stuff okay a

25
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,888
program that just started this year in

26
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,998
fact a couple months ago I was called

27
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:04,970
resilient anonymous communication for

28
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:06,530
everyone it's kind of if like torn

29
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,630
signal how to babies so the way to think

30
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,910
of it is can we do and an encrypted

31
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,679
metadata secure messenger and do it by

32
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,899
actually having MPC as the kind of

33
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,340
underlying distributed system so that

34
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,140
the underlying kind of message passing

35
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,390
system in and of itself doesn't know

36
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,910
what it's doing so you know that might

37
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,860
work but it involves a massive party NPC

38
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,970
but doing like very basic things so the

39
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,980
kind of message allocation is not

40
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,710
hopefully substantially more complicated

41
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,930
than like coin tossing to things that

42
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,240
are ongoing there's a program that's on

43
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,610
that's been publicly announced called

44
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,380
sieve which has a giant name that I'm

45
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,600
not going to say right now and it's all

46
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,839
about zero knowledge specifically a zero

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,789
knowledge for large complex problems

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,320
basically task one is build the actual

49
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,450
problem statements for weird and

50
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,160
interesting problems do the actual

51
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,690
proofs and then post quantum zero

52
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,100
knowledge there's a lot more to say

53
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,200
about it and if you curious

54
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,910
check out the BA which is this giant

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,220
link or probably you should just googled

56
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,740
our passive and C and C you can find

57
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,289
notably the due date for the proposals

58
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,880
are a month from today so if this is a

59
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,009
program you hadn't heard about yet I'm

60
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,790
surprised we're doing is there knowledge

61
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:16,190
program it should be fun okay and

62
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,489
finally I want to talk briefly about

63
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,769
DARPA young faculty award so

64
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,720
for our definition of young is actually

65
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:24,040
apparently a little broad so to be

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,159
eligible you have to be a tenure-track

67
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,798
faculty at a u.s. institution within

68
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,420
three years of tenure or more junior so

69
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:33,879
interestingly you can be a non-us

70
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,349
citizen at a u.s. institution it turns

71
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,109
out you actually can't be a US citizen

72
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:41,200
at a non-us institution I don't know why

73
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,510
that is and it's up to $500,000 for the

74
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,959
first two years you should be checking

75
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,370
out FBI gov or DARPA dot mil for the

76
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,769
announcement which I actually think is

77
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,019
going to be out tomorrow with a due date

78
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:55,359
once you see the announcement within a

79
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:57,340
month or two I'm mentioning this because

80
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:59,280
there will be a topic in cryptography

81
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,379
specifically in the young faculty award

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,000
the title of which is economic driven

83
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:05,950
secure multi-party computation so

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,970
basically the way to think of it is one

85
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,310
of the interesting things that kind of

86
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,840
Bitcoin taught us is you can take

87
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,879
frankly somewhat trivial crypto right so

88
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,560
like ECDSA shot to you and the like and

89
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,149
then you bribe people and then because

90
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,980
of the bribing you can make massive

91
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,500
secure computation right massive

92
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,090
distributed computation so that tends to

93
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,950
tell us that like maybe this whole like

94
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,359
economic utility thing might have

95
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,380
relevance when we want to think about

96
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:28,660
kind of large-scale distributed

97
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,579
computation so this young faculty award

98
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,840
will be specifically about that

99
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,030
please don't come at me with like a

100
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,500
covert or a fairness thing that we've

101
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,849
known about for a very long time the

102
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,760
point is to actually be pretty broad in

103
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:41,560
general about kind of trying to marry

104
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,629
kind of economics with distributed

105
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,980
computation should be fun what could

106
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:48,010
possibly go wrong

107
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,349
if you have thoughts about you know what

108
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,849
DARPA is doing right or probably more

109
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:55,000
interestingly what DARPA is doing wrong

110
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:58,238
in cryptography feel free to find me and

111
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,230
yell politely and tell me of the kinds

112
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,870
of things that you think we should be

113
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:06,109
addressing but are not so thank you

114
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,110
[Applause]
