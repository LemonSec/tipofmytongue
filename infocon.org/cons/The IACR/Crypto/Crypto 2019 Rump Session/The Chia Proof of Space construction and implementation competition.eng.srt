1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:13,010
hi so we have come up with a new proof

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:16,320
of space space construction which is

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:22,939
simpler and more practical than peddling

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,940
based ones and and has unique solutions

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,540
we have published this now it's

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,070
available to everyone we are having a

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,610
programming competition for best

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,960
implementation of it we made a reference

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,550
implementation available with a whole

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,829
bunch of documentation about how it

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,248
works and thoughts on possible ways of

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,420
improving it and we have $100,000 in

13
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,100
prize money that we're going to be

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,539
giving away for best implementations of

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,839
this and it's open to the public

16
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,190
anyone is free to enter just submit

17
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:52,079
people submit the code and we'll run it

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:58,099
on our benchmark hardware and its

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,100
objective judging so please check it out

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,219
[Applause]
