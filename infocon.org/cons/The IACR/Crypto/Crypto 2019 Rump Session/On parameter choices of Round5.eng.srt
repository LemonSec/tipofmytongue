00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,290
my name is Jung Mazzone and today I am

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:18,610
gonna shoot an ultimate about parameter

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:20,860
choices of round 5 round white scheme is

4
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,988
a fabric Ian Christian and King

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:26,110
capsulation mechanism scheme based on

6
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:30,220
running with rounding which is defined

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:33,220
by following this is one of land to

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:38,470
candidate of NIST pqc standardization

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:41,680
and it it has unique feature that usage

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,839
of sparse and ternary secret vectors as

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,810
first means that the secret vector has

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:51,030
low Hamming weight and ternary means the

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,030
components consist of plus minus 1 and 0

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,700
like other lattice faced cryptography

15
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:03,670
each choice choose parameters by Alltech

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:06,280
algorithms and they considered three

17
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,979
attack algorithms the first one is the

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:14,100
primer attack and the hybrid tech and

19
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:17,880
the rusty Studdard attack but recently I

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:21,369
read their specification document and

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,560
notice that the Douro tag is not

22
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:27,909
correctly considered in their forums a

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:35,049
choice and as I saw the latest version

24
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:38,710
of document in their website I modified

25
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:42,280
the public LW estimator of a rich header

26
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:44,619
and we produced their furniture choice

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,780
and also operates

28
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:53,350
duratec and I also remote would like to

29
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:55,720
remark that I sent an email to around 5

30
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:59,559
team to improve this and they leap right

31
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:02,590
to me they are already aware of this and

32
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:07,150
they are trying to update the parameter

33
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:10,650
according to this and they gave some bit

34
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:17,020
at the bit security estimation in

35
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:20,890
star-shaped one so you can see that the

36
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:24,580
that should have one to eight bits

37
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:32,760
security cannot enjoy the crime stick

38
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:36,240
whatever this is table 1 and or 192 and

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,239
to five six

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,110
