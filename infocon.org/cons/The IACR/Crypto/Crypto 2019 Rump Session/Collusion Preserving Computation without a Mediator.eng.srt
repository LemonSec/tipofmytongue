1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,510
the title that I wanted was called stop

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,900
cheating but this is not very

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:19,400
informative so the serious title is this

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:23,140
long one so when we talk about collusion

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,299
in real life we talk about games and

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,360
specifically games where your friends

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:32,689
Alice tries to cheat you out of your

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:36,469
hard earned money by wiggling her

9
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:40,609
eyebrows at her friend bulb and sending

10
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:43,609
him her hand in poker I'm not sure this

11
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:48,859
is legal because they're young but

12
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:50,749
anyway so closure and protocols is

13
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:53,899
pretty much the same thing

14
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:57,370
so collision happens when corrupt

15
00:00:53,899 --> 00:01:01,210
parties send some kind of disallowed

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:05,899
information through subliminal messages

17
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:09,649
for example their poker hand and so a

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:13,549
collusion free protocol is one where if

19
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:16,369
you have a local adversary that is an

20
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:18,049
adversary that don't where the corrupted

21
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:22,450
parties don't automatically share

22
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:27,170
information then you can prove that

23
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:33,380
corrupted parties can be emulated by non

24
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:37,549
colluding ideal adversaries okay so is

25
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:40,339
it possible then to have this security

26
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:43,340
guaranteed for protocols that are played

27
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,909
on the network and the somewhat

28
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,670
surprising answer is yes so you can play

29
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:51,890
poker with your friends without being

30
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:56,869
cheated out of your hard-earned money

31
00:01:51,890 --> 00:02:01,159
online and but this yes has sort of an

32
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:03,469
asterisk because this is only possible

33
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,509
as far as we know in these two settings

34
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:09,799
so the first setting is through

35
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:12,370
restricted communication so with a for

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,170
example a semi trusted mediator and the

37
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,670
second setting is in the broadcast model

38
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:21,109
but

39
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:25,910
we don't allow abort and also we have we

40
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:29,450
need physical envelopes so okay so it

41
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:34,040
seems like mediator is nice because we

42
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:35,929
allow a port but why don't we use it the

43
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,359
reason is because a potentially

44
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:42,100
malicious mediator can cut off

45
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,160
communication between it and some note

46
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,570
some player in the game for example and

47
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,240
this is indistinguishable from that

48
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:53,060
player be malicious and just not sending

49
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,190
any messages to the mediator so

50
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,250
basically what we mean is that a

51
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:02,120
mediator that's malicious means that

52
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:06,710
there is no fairness and no identifiable

53
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:10,880
court which is bad for games okay so

54
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:12,890
let's try with broadcast so in broadcast

55
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,030
what we want ideally is we don't

56
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:20,450
necessarily want like a assumption of

57
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:23,989
physical envelopes and we want something

58
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:26,959
like a composable protocol which is

59
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:29,720
means that we can have multiple games

60
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,330
being paid at the same time and thirdly

61
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,330
we want some guarantees in case of abort

62
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:46,010
so and that's the point our protocols

63
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:47,988
will be proven to be coercion free in

64
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:51,230
the following model which is called

65
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:54,440
rational protocol design RPD so which

66
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:59,090
says that basically a protocol is closed

67
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:01,430
and free if a rational attacker won't

68
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:05,450
deviate from it and what that just means

69
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:09,170
is that we make it so that in our

70
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:12,049
protocol it doesn't make sense for a

71
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:17,899
rational attacker to deviate because it

72
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:18,950
incurs a negative payoff for him and so

73
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,729
how do we do that

74
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:25,880
we replace the physical envelope with

75
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:29,430
hardware tokens and the idea is

76
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:35,940
basically to make the npc protocol

77
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:38,009
mystic by having the token generate and

78
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,680
also hide from the adversary the

79
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:45,830
randomness and so what we get from this

80
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:50,000
is composability and also since abort or

81
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:53,698
misbehavior is publicly of verifiable

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,820
this behavior can be penalized for

83
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,820
example if using try smart contracts

84
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,459
