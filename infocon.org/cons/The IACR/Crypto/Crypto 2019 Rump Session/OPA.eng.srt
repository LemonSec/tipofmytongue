1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,219
right so this this talk has a character

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:13,309
both scientific and and cultural so I

3
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:16,189
started a scientific part I'll tell you

4
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:16,730
about a recent result we have with my

5
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:20,230
student

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:24,140
Hamada second a colleague an anova about

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,860
optimal MPC mixing what does general

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,689
idea

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,329
we know that different types of

10
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:32,570
operations like addition multiplications

11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,770
or boolean gates are better faster more

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,780
efficiently computed by different

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,010
protocols for example we know that the

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,370
garbled circuits are better for

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,660
computing boolean operations and and bTW

16
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,260
is better for computing arithmetic

17
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:48,620
operator so and we could in principle

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,690
think of computing a circuit different

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,430
gates by different protocols but the

20
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,800
problem is that these protocols somehow

21
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:59,090
process a different state we want to do

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,370
it securely so what we in fact would

23
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,079
need to be doing is computing something

24
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,380
like this think of it as a meta circuit

25
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,790
where we have a combination of jate

26
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,880
standard gates like addition

27
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:15,859
multiplication boolean and so on and

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,649
some conversion gates and this is what

29
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:20,030
we would be trying to do so let me make

30
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:23,569
a parenthesis now from the scientific

31
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:27,979
part the cultural part so many of you

32
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:29,950
have seen Greeks breaking plates and

33
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:33,109
yelling OPA

34
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:36,439
what you might not know is why we do

35
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:39,380
that the reason we do that and we use

36
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:43,579
exactly this word OPA is to express our

37
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:46,280
excitement about an advancement in a

38
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:48,758
problem known as optimal protocol

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,759
assignment

40
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,059
what is the problem the problem is

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,509
figuring out what's the best way of

42
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,810
combining protocols says that we compute

43
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:04,890
this circuit here as fast as possible

44
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:08,550
and this problem was conjectured to be

45
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,590
np-hard what we proved in this work

46
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,640
which is to appear at the subatomic CCS

47
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,050
is that actually you can solve it the LP

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,970
relaxation of this problem has an

49
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,970
integral solution and therefore it can

50
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,340
be solved efficiently we have an open

51
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,330
source optimal protocol mixer and this

52
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,520
means that you can take arbitrary

53
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,800
protocols or our mixer is independent of

54
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:34,760
the actual implementation so at this

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,760
point as a Greek I would just say OPA

56
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:48,120
right now I'm warmed up for the next

57
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:50,309
talk so will be we're gonna be holding a

58
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,250
PK c 2020 at the University of Edinburgh

59
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,640
there's something unique about this PK

60
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,650
see this is to my knowledge the first

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,190
conference which is in the country to be

62
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,190
decided

63
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:19,110
[Applause]

64
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:22,260
so so at this point it's we know it's

65
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,870
going to be in the United Kingdom it's

66
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,030
yet to be seen where it's gonna be it's

67
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,030
going to be at the informatics forum at

68
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,099
the University of Edinburgh the

69
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,319
programme sir is a yellow sky yes and we

70
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,828
are culturing it the general says are

71
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:41,659
myself better say Walden and Markov cole

72
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:45,120
mize few words about Edinburgh there is

73
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:45,989
things to do outdoors hiking it's a

74
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,609
beautiful city

75
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:53,040
it's a UNESCO heritage city and of

76
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:56,040
course we have our scouts but you might

77
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:02,489
not know it's not we have very stylish

78
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:06,930
cows and we have beaches and you don't

79
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:09,290
even need sunscreen so please submit

80
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:19,199
your best words there

81
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:21,238
thank you he went so fast that you

82
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,650
missed the slide where he said that the

83
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,400
submission deadline is the second of

84
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:28,440
November and there is going to be lovely

85
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,948
weather in April which is one of the

86
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,750
driest month in Edinburgh so Edinburgh

87
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:37,909
as a spring in spring is a delight

88
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,909
especially in contrast to its winter
