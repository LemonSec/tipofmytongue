1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,219
yeah hi I sometimes pretend to be a

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,840
cryptographer but

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,220
involved in a startup that's doing data

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,619
mining for real estate

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:20,270
it's called Deckard and what we do is we

6
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,279
find out interesting stuff about people

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,810
and their properties and we sell it to

8
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:25,880
the government yeah

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:30,290
by way of anecdote governments are not

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:33,890
smart so here's here's the anecdote ok

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:35,480
so back in the 1970s 7400 series TTL

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,600
proves I'm old

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,930
we the Australian government put out a

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,250
tender for these chips and of course all

15
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,990
of the chips at the time were produced

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,590
in the u.s. except Japan was trying to

17
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:50,240
get in the game and Japan put in a

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,190
tender there was much much much cheaper

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,750
than the Australian that sorry than the

20
00:00:52,190 --> 00:01:01,339
US people and they won the tender and

21
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:03,350
when the chips arrived we it had a note

22
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,119
we don't know why you specified five

23
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:09,909
percent defective chips but we paged

24
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:12,909
them separately for your convenience so

25
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:12,909
recently

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,020
recently we had the same kind of

27
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,789
interaction with I'll just drop a hint

28
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,920
here that I live in San Diego it was

29
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,800
probably my local County

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,700
we're tendering to give data to the

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,679
government and they had they said oh no

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,510
you can't just have a contract you have

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,420
to go through the tender process the RFQ

34
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,340
process so they put out an RFQ but the

35
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,350
only template they had for thing for an

36
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,570
RFQ was things like light bulbs or

37
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:49,149
office chairs or whatever and and it

38
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:51,339
says give us 250 and we will choose 50

39
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,620
at random and test them and give you

40
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,480
back the other 200 you know this is just

41
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,640
what they do for stuff like this

42
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,310
except of course we're selling them data

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,960
and we can't give them 250 and then take

44
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,910
back the 200 that they've already seen

45
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:10,630
so of course I came up with the trivial

46
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:12,549
zero knowledge proof basically giving

47
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,790
them a spreadsheet with slightly

48
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:19,390
obfuscated addresses and a nonce and a

49
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:21,100
hash and it's essentially a really cheap

50
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,440
and nasty zero knowledge proof that

51
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,090
there's no duplicates that it really is

52
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,130
you know that when you chose the

53
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:30,130
particular sequence number but that's

54
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:33,850
the one you ended up getting sort of

55
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:36,010
worked so you have to seed the hashes

56
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,959
with different monsters so that you know

57
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,399
you can't just do a trivial address

58
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,530
matching thing because there's only a

59
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,060
million properties in San Diego and you

60
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,390
know the addresses of all of them if

61
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:51,400
they do they're the county so you know

62
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:53,738
pretty obvious and we only included the

63
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,270
partial addresses because we wanted to

64
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:59,560
convince them that you know that they

65
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:01,209
really did get what they asked for so I

66
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,430
thought this was pretty cool it took me

67
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,350
nearly ten minutes to think of it I was

68
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,820
describing it to Nadia of course it took

69
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,190
her no actually it wasn't not here as

70
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,989
Christine it's what I was describing it

71
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,820
to Christine it took her maybe 30

72
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:14,890
seconds to tell me what the answer was I

73
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,820
mean you know cam came up with the same

74
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:21,339
solution so you know but of course that

75
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,739
wasn't what they wanted to do what they

76
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,480
wanted to do was sit beside somebody

77
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,560
with a spreadsheet on the screen and

78
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,000
point

79
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,650
and they would accept the fact that what

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,440
we emailed to them was what they pointed

81
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,680
out on the screen so that was it thank

82
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,070
you

83
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,840
very trivial

84
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,840
[Applause]
