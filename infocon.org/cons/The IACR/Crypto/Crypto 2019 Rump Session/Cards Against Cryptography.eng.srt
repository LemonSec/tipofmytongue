1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,320
hello so I was asked to give this talk

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,049
on behalf of the three anonymous

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,209
creators of this game so for those of

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,270
you who you may have played a game

5
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:19,890
called cards against entity but this in

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,369
this game it's a fill-in-the-blank game

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,200
so there's a one card with a phrase on

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,210
it in a blank and everyone tries to

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,410
submit what they think is the funniest

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,510
completion

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,200
this isn't cards against humanity' this

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,629
is cars against ography so for example a

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,850
black card might say oh no I just saw

14
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:41,010
public amenities taking another look at

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,590
and you might try to fill in the blank

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,280
or something you think is funny like a

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,530
hand wavy argument or maybe you saw them

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,040
taking another look at a proof that

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,960
appears in the full version they were

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,519
taking another look at host quantum RSA

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,160
or perhaps the North Korean

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,259
cryptographic standards they could have

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,518
been looking at the secret flash drive

24
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:10,530
hidden in my underwear

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:13,830
or the very mature iPod and as another

26
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:17,909
example a crypto conference is never

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:21,179
complete without 17 slides for a three

28
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,900
minute rub session talk I'm I'm doing

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,780
good

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:28,290
we've got the awkward question the chair

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,850
asks when nobody understood the talk

32
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:35,350
the walking zombie corpse of Claude

33
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:38,889
Shannon are quickly trying to peek at

34
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:41,130
someone's badge as I shake their hand

35
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:44,289
but unfortunately but backwards

36
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,089
especially suitable for UCSB if you're

37
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:48,950
staying in the dorms taking a group

38
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:53,610
shower with your recent authors

39
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:56,460
or a career limiting card game so as

40
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,740
Martina said there are two decks for the

41
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,860
funniest from session talks and another

42
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:06,030
one for winning the puzzle if you don't

43
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:09,060
win a game there are cards you can print

44
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,649
at home at this github address or the

45
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,470
creator's tell me you can submit your

46
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:17,289
own cards thanks very much

47
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,289
[Applause]
