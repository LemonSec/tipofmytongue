1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,049
yeah definitely

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,110
that what this is and me too until I

3
00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:18,210
discovered it so we click yes then we

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:21,150
click physics many centuries older

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,240
history in some ways they had theories

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,609
and prints sepia in the 17th century and

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,460
they have been looking for the grand

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:33,780
unified theory for centuries and in

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,449
Switzerland there is something that

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,790
makes roar de neri discoveries on this

11
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:41,968
but it's not the case that the

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,480
physicists have succeeded so far because

13
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,730
there is probably perhaps in the eyes of

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,910
some still a long way to go until they

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,379
have a grand unified theory and of

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,300
course for some people here this is

17
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,079
actually good news because until physics

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,669
knows everything we can still rely on

19
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,870
RSA and everything else because he

20
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,410
hadn't figured out how to build a

21
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,119
quantum computer yet nevertheless I

22
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,420
didn't want to talk about the grand

23
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,580
unified theory in physics I want to talk

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,810
about the grand unified theory of

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,030
cryptology and so you've certainly seen

26
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,369
a lot of work on this in our field in

27
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,770
the past there is lots of general

28
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:26,039
constructions Universal models and

29
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:30,000
whatnot generic systems and proofs and

30
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:31,259
models and the simple result is that's

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,440
why I'm standing here because I

32
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,119
discovered what this is that's you every

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,770
one of you here makes up cryptography

34
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,429
because without people without you and

35
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:44,459
us there wouldn't be any crypto and this

36
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:47,039
is us somewhere in Australia at an Asia

37
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:50,640
crypt conference we even managed to move

38
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:53,670
Asia to Australia and so the only thing

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,789
I wanted to mention here was that is

40
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,399
your needs your support and there is an

41
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:02,759
is your election coming up in this year

42
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,950
so go to the website and look at the

43
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,980
procedure and that at this time we're in

44
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,039
the nomination phase thank you

45
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,039
you
