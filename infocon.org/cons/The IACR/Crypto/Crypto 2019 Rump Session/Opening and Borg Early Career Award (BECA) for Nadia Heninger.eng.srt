1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,559
so welcome to the rum session this year

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:12,050
so it's called the fellowship of the rum

3
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,629
because as you know because Christian

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:19,210
mentioned it the fellowship program is

5
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:21,890
15 years old so we will have a little

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,170
celebration of the contribution to the

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,449
fellows or rather the fellows themselves

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:30,980
so what you will see is that for each

9
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:35,300
slide when we begin there will be not

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:37,070
this there will be fellow here and then

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,010
you have to figure out who is this

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,680
fellow and then if you guess all the

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,780
fellows correctly you will be able to

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,239
retrieve a plaintext if you're very

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,860
clever and then the first person who

16
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:50,690
shouts this plaintext which is allowed

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:55,160
you're allowed to shout it during any of

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:58,730
the talks so no no no the plate that's

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:02,718
yeah that's s Arion but and then whoever

20
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:09,530
gets first will win cards against crypto

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:12,320
set yeah so also if you notice that

22
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,150
there is this line here so make sure if

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,399
you are on the room session program if

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,520
your speaker that you if you have to get

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,340
ready then you walk over there then when

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,759
you're here you can start talking and go

27
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:28,250
to your slide well then once you have

28
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:33,079
fixed you're finished your talk then

29
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:35,689
please press again so you go to the next

30
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,210

talk the first actual talk of the room

32
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,860
session which is the bork Early Career

33
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,949
Award will which will be presented by

34
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:49,240

35
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,240
award so please go ahead

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:06,190
I've been asked by the CRA w committee

37
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,509
to give this award just want to tell you

38
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,508
a little bit about it

39
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:13,360
the CRA W is an action board under the

40
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:14,679
computing Research Association that

41
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,140
helps women and other underrepresented

42
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,140
groups persist and succeed in computing

43
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,929
research it was found in 1991 funded by

44
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:26,410
NSF industry and other private donors

45
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:29,920
every year the CRA W selects an

46
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:32,470
outstanding nominee for outstanding

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,200
recipient for the Borg early career

48
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,209
award this honors the late Anita Borg

49
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,989
who was one of the first members of CRA

50
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:42,820
W as well as an inspiration for her

51
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,670
commitment to increasing participation

52
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:48,640
of women in computing research so this

53
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:52,869
award is given to women in the field

54
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,130
young young women in the field who have

55
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,840
made significant research contributions

56
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:03,340
both to the profession as well as

57
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,830
towards the outreach to to women it the

58
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,560
award recognizes work in areas of

59
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,720
academia and industrial government

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,690
research labs that has had a positive

61
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,430
and significant impact of advancing

62
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,459
women in the computing research

63
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:21,190
community and as I mentioned targeted at

64
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:24,580
women with relatively early in the in

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,019
Nadia Henninger for her

68
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,989
for her research contributions in the

69
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,510
area of cryptography security crypt

70
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:47,530
analysis of public key cryptography and

71
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:51,140
practice as well as her outreach

72
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,459

while she was in UPenn before going to

81
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,269
UCSD and it gives me great pleasure to

82
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,269
give this award to not

83
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,780
not the other say a few world

84
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:36,190
we're already over time but if you said

85
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,500
I should say something a pretty vase so

86
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,330
I wanted to say just very briefly that

87
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,930
the first time I ever attended crypto

88
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:46,450
was ten years ago exactly 2009 and that

89
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,910
was my first and only crypto paper and

90
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,969
it was my first conference talk ever

91
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,530
and I was incredibly nervous the night

92
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,950
before it was the first talk in the

93
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:59,260
first session of field that I wasn't

94
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:03,430
even a member of I was I'm a failed a

95
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:05,409
theorist and I showed up and the night

96
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,560
before there were ten people who were

97
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:13,090
helping me practice my talk in one of

98
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,950
the dorm rooms and I felt so encouraged

99
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,530
everybody was so friendly and I remember

100
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:20,200
sitting on stage and having a slide

101
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:27,219
that's like let me explain RSA and RNs

102
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:28,840
are sitting in the front row I also as a

103
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,390
sort of failed theorist who was adopted

104
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,539
by this community and I really wanted to

105
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:37,060
express how grateful I was to the people

106
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,860
who sort of took a chance on me um popov

107
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,200
Giacomin and dan Bernstein and Tania

108
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,710
Lana and Henry particular sort of

109
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:48,490
adopted me as a lost grad student now

110
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,930
for some reason I'm here I really am

111
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,370
grateful to this field and how friendly

112
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,750
it is there's so many wonderful women

113
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,150
and there's so many wonderful friendly

114
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:58,420
people and people sort of end up here

115
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:03,859
washed up and do great things

116
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,859
[Applause]
