00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,170
Thank You Martin actually a very happy

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,820
to be here I just found out I have a

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,860
technical problem because they asked me

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,199
if I wanted a microphone handheld or

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,180
just a mic here I said handle this fine

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,340
and otherwise I have three handhelds so

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,700
I need to be an interesting presentation

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:26,390
this one

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:30,890
but anyway so here we go ready yes the

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:33,050
clock's ticking this is not ticking okay

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,059
so so here's the story that we like to

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,068
tell ourselves is that quad computers

13
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:38,568
are coming and we really believe this

14
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:40,909
now we don't know when they're coming

15
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:42,109
but basically at some point we realize

16
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:44,420
something that is able to run Shor's

17
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:48,079
algorithm and then essentially this is

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,850
what's going to happen sorry Abby but so

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,960
this is essentially the motivation for

20
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,219
all of our work so finally nice decided

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,170
there was time to do something about it

22
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:59,269
and they launched the competition as we

23
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,909
know we're all here for that and so now

24
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:03,888
we have many schemes that are based on

25
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:06,260
many different problems and assumptions

26
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:07,580
and they feature many variants and they

27
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,439
all achieve different levels of security

28
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,360
and they all have a lot of parameter set

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,520
and have many parameter set per second

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,049
level so in the end we felt that we were

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,460
a little bit confused and we had

32
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:19,729
traveled Harrogate in the competition

33
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,380
and so what we decided to do was to come

34
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:22,850
to the rescue and we offered our help

35
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,890
Denise and East was gracious didn't have

36
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,469
to say yes and so what we tried to do

37
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:30,079
was to organize all the information it's

38
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:31,579
an easy accessible way and to put it all

39
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,710
in one place and to put all the

40
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:34,939
parameters there and tokenize things you

41
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,100
know color coded and all the pretty

42
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:39,859
things that we we do to make things

43
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,908
easily accessible and then we also

44
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:42,829
thought that it was a good idea to

45
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:45,079
collect challenges they relate to every

46
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:47,749
specific submission and we're currently

47
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:49,428
doing this right so we we hope that the

48
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:50,810
community is very gracious with us and

49
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:53,240
collaborates on setting up challenges

50
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,310
for each submission and now I had a very

51
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,109
great idea of clicking on the website

52
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,310
and showing it off to you but those guys

53
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,789
told me that this is not gonna be

54
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,229
possible

55
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:02,390
so I'm gonna just have to believe me

56
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:06,229
that the website is actually live and

57
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:08,449
working and you can always contact us at

58
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:10,520
because a wiki at gmail.com and send all

59
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,500
your greatest ideas challenges comments

60
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,210
you got the parameters wrong this is not

61
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,490
a code base is a lattice based and all

62
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,740
sort of comment so you may have yes this

63
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:23,550
is oh thank you for your attention

64
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,550
[Applause]
