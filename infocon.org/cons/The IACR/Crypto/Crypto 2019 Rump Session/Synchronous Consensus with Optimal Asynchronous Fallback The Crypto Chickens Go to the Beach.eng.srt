1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,649
hi everyone so I'm excited to be here

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,290
tonight to bring you the thrilling

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,480
sequel to my co-authors previous work

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,520
the crypto chickens cross the road

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,990
this is joint work with my advisor

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,130
Jonathan Katz and our lovely

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,929
collaborator Julian laughs okay so

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,299
synchronous consensus with asynchronous

9
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:29,538
fallback the crypto chickens go to the

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:32,060
beach alright so the chicken

11
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:35,990
cryptographers Club is deciding whether

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,610
to take a trip to the beach and now when

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,200
you or I go to the beach maybe the worst

14
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,089
thing that can happen is that you forget

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,010
your sunscreen or a seagull steals your

16
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,750
french fries but the chickens have to be

17
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,750
extra careful because they are always at

18
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,430
risk of being attacked by wily foxes so

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,629
either all of the chickens should go so

20
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,120
that they have strength in numbers and

21
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:55,129
they can fend off attacks from the foxes

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,430
where they should all stay home where

23
00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:00,170
they'll be safe in their coops so the

24
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,149
chickens set out organizing their trip

25
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,170
by sending emails to the end members of

26
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:05,120
the club mailing lists

27
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,650
unfortunately they know from experience

28
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,869
that the mailing list may have been

29
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:13,250
infiltrated by up to F foxes or faults

30
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:14,900
being cryptographers they decide to use

31
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,460
a synchronous Byzantine Agreement

32
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,850
protocol to decide whether to go to the

33
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,919
beach

34
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,149
because of course these protocols have

35
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,159
the property that they ensure

36
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,500
consistency that either all chickens

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,210
decide to go or all chickens decide to

38
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,829
stay home as long as there are not too

39
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,929
many foxes that have snuck their way

40
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:31,820
onto the mailing list so they select a

41
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,490
protocol that tolerates the optimal

42
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,229
number of Fox spies F less than n over 2

43
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:40,089
assuming of course that the chickens

44
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:40,090
have a properly configured PKI

45
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:44,508
as if the chickens task was not

46
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,850
difficult enough they soon faced another

47
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:49,700
roadblock one of the email server admins

48
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,439
is also a fox so sometimes the chickens

49
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,030
find that their emails have been delayed

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,250
or reordered while at other times

51
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,750
everything seems to work normally so

52
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,369
they have no way of knowing on the day

53
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,490
that they are trying to plan this trip

54
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:05,960
to the beach whether or not the emails

55
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:07,369
will go through as they expect so they

56
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,380
know that they could use an asynchronous

57
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:11,570
Byzantine Agreement protocol of course

58
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,549
which would whether any unpredictable

59
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,400
network delays however these protocols

60
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,590
can only tolerate up to n over 3 foxes

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,900
as opposed to the optimal and

62
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:24,860
to tolerated by asynchronous protocol

63
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:27,770
okay can the chickens devised a protocol

64
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,300
that defends against FS greater than or

65
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,620
equal to n over three foxes when the

66
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,200
network is synchronous but still

67
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,790
withstands some F a greater than zero

68
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,589
foxes when the network is asynchronous

69
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:41,269
and because these slides do not have my

70
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,819
clever animations the answer is already

71
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:46,640
in front of you yes our result shows

72
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:50,869
that it is possible if and only if two

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,130
FS plus FA is less than n so the

74
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,049
chickens had a lovely day at the beach

75
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:57,170
and they all lived happily ever after

76
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:59,090
using our protocol and I see that this

77
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,829
has not been updated to reflect the fact

78
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,920
that just yesterday I woke up to an

79
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,870
email that this will be appearing at TCC

80
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,119
so please come and learn more about our

81
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:13,020
clever chickens

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,020
