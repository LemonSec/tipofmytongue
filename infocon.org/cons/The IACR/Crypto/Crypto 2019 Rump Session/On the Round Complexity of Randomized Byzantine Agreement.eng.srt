hi I'm Nicolas I'm sure to talk about

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,940
ground complexity of Byzantine

3
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:19,660
agreements this is the joint work with

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:22,840
Jean Cohen if the Hytner Matano london

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:25,119
alex subordinates he so what's a

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,599
Byzantine agreement it's the distributed

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,360
the tasks such that every party holds an

8
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:35,770
input bits and the parties are required

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,329
to agree on the same output bits and

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,309
there's an additional security

11
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:41,859
requirement that states that at least

12
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:46,289
one party should output its own output

13
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:49,719
bits so in this work we considered the

14
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:53,109
we wanted to bound the probability of

15
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:57,159
halting after one or two rounds and the

16
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:59,609
reason we aimed at for one or two rounds

17
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:03,998
is that three rounds is essentially

18
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:06,520
optimal so what do we show we show that

19
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:09,310
for be a protocols if there's security

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,140
threshold is something like n over three

21
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,360
meaning that at at most n over three

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,070
parties are corrupt then the halting

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,250
probability after one round is

24
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:21,279
vanishingly small and the halting

25
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:26,530
probability after realm two is far away

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:29,770
from one in addition we show that for

27
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,650
most ba protocols and under some

28
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,660
computer toriel assumption that

29
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,120
conjecture actually that I will that I'm

30
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,369
not going to discuss the halting

31
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,870
probability is also vanishingly small

32
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:46,480
after the second round so to show this

33
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:49,000
result we follow the classic blueprint

34
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,910
for deterministic termination meaning

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,370
that we considered a bunch of a sequence

36
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,740
of executions such that the input

37
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:58,870
configuration at the ends of this

38
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,360
execution gives you different output

39
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:07,690
bits and we show that there is an attack

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:09,970
for adjacent executions such that these

41
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,670
executions are indistinguishable for the

42
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:15,219
honest parties however for randomized

43
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,958
protocols this argument fails because

44
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,630
the randomness can be used to

45
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,060
distinguish

46
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,930
between these between adjacent

47
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:28,280
executions so to remedy this what we

48
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:30,530
propose as a solution is to abort some

49
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:36,500
parties in order to decouple the

50
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:39,020
randomness from the outputs this attack

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,960
gives rise to a nice of parametric type

52
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:47,120
inequality we managed to prove this

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:50,660
inequality for some limited cases which

54
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,680
reduce to the famous KKL the theorem and

55
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:58,190
frequence janta theorem but the general

56
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,630
case we left as an open problem so the

57
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:04,750
paper is available online thank you

58
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,750
