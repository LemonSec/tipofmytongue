1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:19,580
so you may think the Falcon is fast and

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:23,990
sexy right but if it speeds around for a

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:25,698
little too long and you may be able to

4
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:31,250
catch it with good timing and a lot of

5
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:34,519
firepower so Falcon for those who are

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,949
familiar with it it's a promising round

7
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:39,949
to can't miss candidate for latest basic

8
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:43,180
insurance so it's a - sign scheme which

9
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:45,620
means that you sign by sampling some

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,200
lettuce lettuce discrete Gaussian

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:55,578
centered at a point determined by the

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:01:00,079
message and basically so to express it

13
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:03,800
as a formula it's gpv so the original

14
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:07,580
that is based hash and sign signatures

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:10,130
together some in true key and some fancy

16
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:14,479
technique based to to speed it up and

17
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:17,539
make it make the sampling quasi linear

18
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,210
so it's a successor of some older scheme

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:25,549
called DLP which was basically Falcon -

20
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:28,789
this fan system and it turns out that on

21
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,970
in both schemes the Falcon and DLP the

22
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,560
latest version something is carried out

23
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:36,610
with something called the black line

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,100
sampler and so it means that you reduce

25
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:43,700
latest version something to some wine

26
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,439
dimensional samplings and the standard

27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,860
deviation of those one dimensional

28
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,570
cushion is determined determined by the

29
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:55,579
gram-schmidt norms of the secret key so

30
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:59,408
there's a timing leakage which is that

31
00:01:55,579 --> 00:02:02,929
the dimension one sampler leaks those

32
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:04,549
J's norms through timing information so

33
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:08,709
the number of a repetition that you

34
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:12,350
carried out for your one dimensional

35
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:14,900
discrete Goshen's so there's an attack

36
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:18,739
here so you start from the gram-schmidt

37
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:21,530
norms and now some

38
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:25,370
interesting math here to get back to

39
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:27,920
some polynomial which is the which we

40
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:32,510
call the hammerschmidt polynomial and

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:35,599
where F and G here are the elements of

42
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:38,060
the secret key and so after that it's

43
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,880
easy enough to get to the secret the

44
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,220
second step is a kind of easy it's

45
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,220
probably time and it's basically the

46
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:49,870
gently siglo algorithm and the first

47
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:53,930
step it's kind of the main contribution

48
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:57,530
it's a fully time for the LP and quasi

49
00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:00,940
poly time or Falcon and you can kind of

50
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,769
so it works these are the timings for

51
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,480
exactly values for the GS norms but if

52
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:10,400
you have approximate values then you can

53
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:14,470
combine it with some tree search to make

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,760
it work even with approximate values so

55
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:20,180
we run that attack

56
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:23,690
last week so we generate something like

57
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,450
two to the 38.5 the LP signatures and

58
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,060
from that you easily extract

59
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:31,220
approximations of the GS norms up to an

60
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,799
error of the two to the minus seven or

61
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,560
something like this and so step one

62
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,060
gives you this GS polynomial you can't

63
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:45,250
probably can't see but anyway

64
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:48,380
and step two gives you the secret so the

65
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,239
like computer surely is quite easy so

66
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,579
the step one took like three minutes

67
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,430
step two it looks a bit longer but it's

68
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:57,230
really low so it's a well known and so

69
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,130
of course you need quite a bit of

70
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:04,399
signatures but it's visible so the

71
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,920
conclusion is that so we have a leakage

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:12,349
of the leakage of the gram-schmidt norm

73
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:14,480
is quite dangerous you get so against

74
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:17,298
Falcone is quasi-polynomial something so

75
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,039
it's kind of theoretical but for the at

76
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:22,729
least for the help it's very concrete

77
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:25,820
and actually so there's an updated

78
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:29,719
version updated implementation of Falcon

79
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,280
that kind of patches this leakage but

80
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,030
it's really important to apply the

81
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,849
countermeasure

82
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:40,109
or secret thank you very much

83
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,109
