1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:10,250
hey everyone my name is valera Nikhil

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,750
ANCA from Calibra Facebook and I decided

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,309
to give you glimpse into what kind of

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,619
research problems who are looking at

5
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:18,169
because it's quite a nice script or

6
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:21,320
group is forming up there so I decided

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,340
to very briefly describe you one of the

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,840
projects you're working on

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,880
it's the project called Winkle it

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,490
protects blockchains from forks of

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,280
history and this is joint work with PhD

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:34,329
candidate Sarah Xue beam she is also an

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:38,030
internet calibra and George Dennis's

14
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:40,460
sorry dick so we are mainly concerned

15
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,559
with proof of stake blockchains and this

16
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,480
is the chain of blocks that originates

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,818
from San Genesis block and if we zoom

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,890
into one of the blocks we can see that

19
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:50,329
there is a parent hash to change the

20
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,550
block with the previous one there's an

21
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:54,399
ordered list of transactions and there

22
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,629
is a signature by violators that

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,269
validates this block that makes this

24
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:01,218
block valid so the validators are the

25
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:04,429
ones who run consensus protocol between

26
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:05,870
each other and they're trying to consent

27
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,190
to the next block and if they agree in

28
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,960
the next block they supplied joint

29
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,390
signature on that block and this makes

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,160
the block valid and usually in place

31
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,590
there are some incentive mechanisms to

32
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,300
keep violators honest during the

33
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,220
consensus protocol so in particular

34
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,740
sometimes they lock the money to become

35
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,970
violators and if they behave honestly

36
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,830
they get their money back plus some

37
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,570
reward if they misbehave or deviate from

38
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,880
the protocol they don't get their money

39
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,190
back so they have strong incentives to

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,929
stay honest during the execution but the

41
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,370
problem is once they got their money

42
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,640
back they have no more incentives to

43
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:39,350
keep their old keys secure and so in

44
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,210
this project we're asking ourselves the

45
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,759
questions what if I they just lose their

46
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,199
old keys what can happen what basically

47
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,920
this is also known as nothing at stake

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,810
attack and deduction community and the

49
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,180
devastating thing will happen basically

50
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,070
the other so you've got old kids of the

51
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,990
world leaders will be able to create a

52
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:00,350
fork of the of the history of the

53
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,940
blockchain and proof of stake box chains

54
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,589
are particularly susceptible to this

55
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,360
kind of attack so they don't deploy some

56
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,360
proof of work or some delay functions

57
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,830
basically for King comes for free

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,599
because you can very quickly produce as

59
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,819
many signatures as you want on the

60
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,850
adversarial chain and create a very long

61
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:18,799
Fork and also the poor user has now way

62
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:21,590
no way of differentiating between

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,990
through chain and the Rosario chain so

64
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,330
what do we do and basically what the

65
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,490
adversary can do with this is fork he

66
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,080
can censor the network he can replay

67
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:33,460
transactions that she like and he can

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:38,030
drop transactions that he doesn't like

69
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:40,610
so the solution comes from kind of bird

70
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,350
eye view of the problem so old

71
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,690
blockchain users they're typically very

72
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,790
large set they're like a lot of million

73
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,590
or billion know what of them but the

74
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,060
very later sets very smallest of the

75
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,740
order four hundred twelve thousand and

76
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,780
reason for that is because consensus is

77
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,250
very expensive they need in particular

78
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,410
like pairwise channels between each

79
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,140
other so when you start growing divided

80
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,480
reset over a thousand this becomes

81
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,489
challenging consensus becomes slow new

82
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,049
blocks and appearing frequently so you

83
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,360
don't want that you want this set to be

84
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,340
small but the problem now is for the

85
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,350
attacker it makes it easier for him to

86
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,300
attack some substantial set of violators

87
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,549
first so some substantial set of users

88
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:20,000
which makes this blockchain kind of

89
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:22,340
vulnerable and so here's an idea why

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,380
don't we put power in the hands of the

91
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,260
users and why don't we allow the users

92
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,180
to also vote on the chain so we propose

93
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,220
out meant in transactions with basically

94
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,840
the block so the transaction will be the

95
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,300
standard receive amount and the block

96
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,370
because typically users have some idea

97
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,410
of what the tip of the blockchain is or

98
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,630
they have some trusted party that would

99
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:45,260
that they trust that will tell them

100
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,940
what's the tip of the chain so we keep

101
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,399
track of these roads and once we collect

102
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,810
2/3 of votes weighted by the amount

103
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,140
under their accounts we consider the

104
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,790
block check pointed and then basically

105
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,890
we are proving a theorem that an

106
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,170
adversary cannot checkpoint and you

107
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,700
block in the fork and that gives a way

108
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,470
for the to differentiate between the

109
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,910
true chain and adversarial chain because

110
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,520
the true chain will have more recent

111
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:10,459
check points now what makes this theorem

112
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,040
challenging is that the state changes

113
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:16,280
hands and so the voting power kind of

114
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,019
shifts around so basically what we are

115
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,089
doing is we are running to proof of

116
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,590
stake proposing and frightening to proof

117
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,479
of stake algorithms on top of each other

118
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:27,619
proof of stake by users on top of proof

119
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:30,650
of stake by validators interesting point

120
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,810
also about the kind of assumptions here

121
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,969
so

122
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,990
typically in Byzantine for torrent

123
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,580
protocols there is a gap between the

124
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,350
number of people who need to vote and

125
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,780
our visiting nodes that you can tolerate

126
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,580
this one short gap but here basically

127
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,280
we're kind of in a synchronous setting

128
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:49,039
because we can wait forever for the

129
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,049
users to checkpoint here blocks so this

130
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,580
assumptions can be relaxed and sorry

131
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,770
there is a type or it can be bring to

132
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,680
like 1/2 and 1/2 plus Epsilon so if we

133
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:00,500
believe only epsilon fraction of users

134
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,960
can be clips from the network so this

135
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,570
high-level idea can benefit not just

136
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,370
block chains that I describe but

137
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:10,370
potentially other blockchain projects as

138
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,729
well it's also independent of the type

139
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:16,040
of consensus algorithm that you run both

140
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:18,020
circular consensus grantees liveness and

141
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,350
the current is short-term security while

142
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,930
this kind of protocol empowers users to

143
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:27,990
participate in the government term

144
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:31,689
governing of the blockchain thank you

145
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,689
