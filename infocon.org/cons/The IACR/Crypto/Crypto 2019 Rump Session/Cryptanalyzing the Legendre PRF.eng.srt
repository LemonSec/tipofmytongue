00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,549
hello I'd like to talk to you quickly

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:15,809
about the Lizano pseudo-random function

3
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:18,720
which is a an idea introduced by Adam

4
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,820
got an 80 in a paper in 88 and it's a

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,750
very simple construction that's based on

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,760
you just add your key and your inputs

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,340
and you compute the letter on a symbol

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,170
of it and then you normalize it to be a

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,989
bit and that gives you one pseudo-random

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,239
bit and now the thing about this

11
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,059
pseudo-random function it is very very

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,269
friendly to NPCs which I quickly want to

13
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:45,449
show because you can just compute some

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,340
pseudo some random square and you

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,210
basically just blind your value with it

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,129
and then you can compute this later on a

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,930
symbol in the open and if you add

18
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,760
another random bit to this constructor

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,019
you can also blind the result and

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:05,970
further things why it might be

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,610
interesting is that if if there were so

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,140
basically we don't know yet how good it

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,840
is as a pseudo-random function it hasn't

24
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,689
been analyzed very much but say there

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,640
was a key recovery algorithm then that

26
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:22,039
would imply there cannot be a fully

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:25,680
homomorphic injective function on FP

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,409
because you can basically compute then

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,820
using the homomorphic property the

30
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:36,450
Legendre symbol of any element and that

31
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,600
would break the one-way function

32
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,909
property and similarly with a similar

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,059
trick you can also show that basically

34
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,869
it would imply the equivalence of the

35
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,649
discrete logarithm and the

36
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:52,500
diffie-hellman assumption and so

37
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,070
basically we had a theorem because of

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,930
this very friendly two-way NPC property

39
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,610
we're really interested in this PRF and

40
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,189
we want to use it for some of our

41
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,170
constructions at the moment and that's

42
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,419
why I'm here to announce that we are

43
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,220
going to have some bounties for breaking

44
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,769
recipe I if I heard there are many

45
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,099
people here who like breaking stuff well

46
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:15,629
you can win some bounties for doing it

47
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,880
especially if you break it completely as

48
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:22,100
a PRF

49
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:24,590
you can win $10,000 and or alternatively

50
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:28,760
if you can show that somehow it can be

51
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:31,370
reduced to some well-known computational

52
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,760
hottest assumption yeah and there are

53
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:37,340
some more prizes for either just any

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,109
algorithmic improvements or for the most

55
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,810
interesting paper that's published on

56
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:45,200
this pif over the next year and for more

57
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,120
details go to Legendre pif org and and

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,910
them a few more details on these prizes

59
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,539
thank you

60
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,539
