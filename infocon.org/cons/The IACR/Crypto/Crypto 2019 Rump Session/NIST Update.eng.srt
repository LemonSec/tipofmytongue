1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,129
all right so I'm John Kelsey I work at

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,440
NIST and I want to tell you what we're

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,110
up to at least some of what we're up to

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,670
so the nose of the post quantum crypto

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,550
competition that's the thing everybody

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,860
knows about you can the slides are I

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,800
think online or you can ask me I'll send

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,360
them to you so there's a workshop right

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,710
after crypto so that's the place to

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,720
really go for more information

11
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,760
but you can see what's going on we have

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,348
still several submissions and we're

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,050
still kind of percolating on that

14
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:38,199
thinking about what the next next step

15
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,720
is as far as paring things down and

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,980
stick around after crypto to find out

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:47,230
more we also are working on a standard

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,599
for or on a standardization effort for

19
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,459
lightweight crypto that means crypto

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,720
that you know symmetric crypto that is

21
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:58,210
less demanding than say AES and so you

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,809
can see there's this process hey got a

23
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,730
laser there's this process here for for

24
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:05,619
choosing one of these we've had this

25
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,798
competition started a little while ago

26
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:09,790
we have like a whole bunch of

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,860
competitors and we're getting ready to

28
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,330
winnow things down a bit and there'll be

29
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,210
several more rounds I think before we

30
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,830
get to a final answer here and you can

31
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,809
see the URL here and there's also

32
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,240
there's a mailing list and all kinds of

33
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,700
stuff if you're interested so let's see

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,750
what else we got random bit generators

35
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,420
this is something I've been working on

36
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,670
for basically my whole time at NIST so

37
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,740
we recently by recently I mean like a

38
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,740
year ago a year and a half ago we

39
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:38,520
published 90b which is standard for

40
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:43,270
entropy sources and resource evaluation

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,220
we are kind of trying to collect errata

42
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,140
about this like basically errors in

43
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,420
formulas ambiguities things like that

44
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,770
and we keep trying to get to a final

45
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,710
point on that and then finding out that

46
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,270
there are more more comments so we

47
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,298
hopefully hopefully will be putting out

48
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,470
a revised version soon we also have 90c

49
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:01,119
which will be coming out soon and this

50
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:05,079
is the final piece of this this tells

51
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,090
you how to take a drbg from 90a the

52
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,848
deterministic random gender Genet random

53
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,950
bit generator and then an entropy source

54
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:16,089
from 90 b and put them together to make

55
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:18,519
a full RBG so that'll be coming out soon

56
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,970
and we hope to get comments from it so

57
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,370
let's

58
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,410
then the most interesting thing probably

59
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,930
that I need to talk about is Phipps 186

60
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,010
- 5 the digital signature standard so

61
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,070
this is gonna be out for public comment

62
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,899
very soon important things number one

63
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:35,170
and we're adding support for

64
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:38,830
deterministic stuff EDD sa ECDSA

65
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:41,380
deterministic we also have fixed this

66
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,640
thing that we're not quite I'm not quite

67
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,760
sure why it wound up this way where we

68
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,290
weren't allowing large RSA moduli so if

69
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:53,950
you really want to do post quantum RSA

70
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:57,670
now you know okay yeah the other thing

71
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:01,030
is we're planning to to kind of do away

72
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,380
with DSA with just integer GSA so this

73
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,550
is there a couple of reasons for this

74
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,750
involving like you know it's kind of

75
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,880
hard to get the parameters right and

76
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,710
also hardly anybody's using it so if you

77
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,930
have strong feelings about this like if

78
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,510
US doing away with support for normal

79
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,210
DSA is gonna just kill you let us know

80
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,370
on the on the comment email and there's

81
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,600
you know well you can catch up with me

82
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,190
or Dustin who's actually really the

83
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,810
project lead on this so let's see then

84
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,130
the NIST thresholds crypto project which

85
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,110
apparently looks like it's some sort of

86
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,200
a cult thing involving summoning demons

87
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:34,120
but I'm not quite sure how that works

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,310
so basically we're working on

89
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:41,170
standardizing threshold schemes and then

90
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:42,970
and you may be threshold like Shammi or

91
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,309
maybe something like signing new

92
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:48,040
threshold signatures threshold public

93
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,840
key saying schemes so this is a big

94
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,720
project we've got we've got an Esther

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,519
out that's a white paper basically we

96
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,900
had a workshop earlier this year and

97
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,080
we're kind of trying to figure out what

98
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,540
to do next and so there's a road map

99
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,709
that we're gonna kind of put up

100
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,910
basically to say how we're gonna get to

101
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,860
something standardized how are we're

102
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:09,340
going to get to standardizing things so

103
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,680
that's I think if some of you saw

104
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,540
Louise's talk on Sunday so so you know

105
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,410
more than that everybody else about this

106
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:21,370
and the last kind of big thing is

107
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:23,380
randomness beacons so the crypto like

108
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,450
the 890 series is about generating

109
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,789
secret random numbers things for keys

110
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:31,240
this is public randomness the idea here

111
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:32,950
is you have you know you have a source

112
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,020
thing every once a minute

113
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,700
uses a random number it's got a digital

114
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,310
signature it's got a timestamp their

115
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,219
hash chains you can't even the beacon

116
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,930
operator can't change the past and these

117
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,140
are these are useful for various kinds

118
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:49,600
of public coordination things like

119
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,969
audits and things like that so we've got

120
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,960
a new standard for interoperable

121
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,580
randomness beacons it's I think right

122
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,349
now it's still out in draft but if you

123
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,580
want to download it from our website you

124
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,980
will find it and read it and give us

125
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,590
comments and there are two other

126
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:08,410
organizations in Metro and in Brazil and

127
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,299
Nevada Santiago and Chile that are

128
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,770
running beacons and they're moving to

129
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,690
our standard and so it will be possible

130
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,849
to interoperate combine beacons in a

131
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,520
cryptographically secure way cool stuff

132
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,930
so if you want to look up find more you

133
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,840
can talk to me or you can just look at

134
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,620
these at the URL and I think that's

135
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,268
everything so thanks a lot

136
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,269
[Applause]
