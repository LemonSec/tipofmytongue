1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:12,309
for my title slide disappeared okay so

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:15,940
I'm just here to advertise a new website

3
00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:20,529
challenge website for codebase crypto so

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:23,920
code base crypto essentially is based on

5
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:25,300
the syndrome decoding problem it's over

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,859
there

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:32,949
this problem can only be solved all

8
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:37,839
solvers have an exponential complexity

9
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:40,059
and usually it's described by what is

10
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:44,010
called the asymptotic exponent and you

11
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:47,919
can see here the timeline from 1962 to

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,610
today this coefficient that in going

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,500
down by like 30 percent but this is the

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,690
asymptotic complexity what about

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,360
practical complexity it's probably not

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:03,519
the best algorithm that will give the

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:07,210
best practical result so what my

18
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:10,450
colleagues did is setting up this web

19
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:13,780
page the URL is at their decoding

20
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,590
challenge org it's working now you can

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:20,050
try it

22
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:22,480
and its goal is to assess the practical

23
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:25,440
hardness of problem in coding theory

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,170
there are four categories of challenges

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:34,140
to on generic problems to on problems

26
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:36,670
that are related to NIST competition and

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,400
it's really a great opportunity if you

28
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:42,310
want to have your name on a Hall of Fame

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:46,320
because right now it's empty or almost

30
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:51,180
empty so you can probably very easily

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,550
get your name on that all of Fame and

32
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:58,210
well I'm done so the authors are those

33
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,950
three people Julia mature and Nicola not

34
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,860
me

35
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:09,039
from hyoeun Paris and Lamar and well

36
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:15,580
please contribute try to solve the

37
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:17,000
challenges and contact designers thank

38
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,590
you very much

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,590
[Applause]
