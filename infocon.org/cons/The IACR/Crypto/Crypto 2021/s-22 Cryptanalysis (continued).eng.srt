1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,480
yeah i guess we can start

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,638
okay

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,520
you're ready to go have a good session

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,280
okay thank you

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,880
uh so welcome everybody to the second

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,960
half of the cryptine resist session

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,639
well there will be three

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,599
talks

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,680
again please feel free to ask any

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,480
questions in the zubip chat

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,840
and

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,199
let's start

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,680
immediately with

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,560
the cryptanalysis of full omc and omcm

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,039
with algebraic techniques by fukangyu

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,760
takanori zobe and videmaya

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,120
fukang you will give the talk

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,960
thanks for the introduction so can you

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,040
see my slide

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,280
yes okay

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,520
so

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,000
this is a joint to work with takanoli so

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,480
behind the video so low emcee is a

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,640
family of block sites

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,280
first proposed at europe 2015 and it is

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,120
designed to be mpc and fhe friendly the

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,440
main feature of loans is that there are

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,840
fine layers linear key schedule

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,320
functions and the number of x-boxes per

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,479
round that are all not fixed

31
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,799
the most important application of learn

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,960
c is the picnic signature which was

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,240
proposed at acm ccs the security of the

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,640
picnic signature relies on the security

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,799
of the lemc primitive

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,040
specifically it should be difficult for

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,119
an attacker to efficiently recover the

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,360
key from a single plane test cipher test

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,320
pair of fluency currently in picnic 3

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,720
the 4 roundabout mc with a 4xbox layer

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,960
is adopted in order to reduce the

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,200
verifying and assigning time

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,280
in audition picnic 3 is our ultimate

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,360
third-round candidate it needs to post

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,840
quantum computation we noticed in the

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,399
security proof of picnic that it is

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,240
assumed that enlargement series to

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,119
non-plant tests is secure in this work

49
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,280
we will show how to break some low mc

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,560
instances with tutorial plan tests

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,799
this is our overview of our tech

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,640
framework based on uh the

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,799
difference in numeration attack

54
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,440
uh as the first step we compute a

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,520
deterministic differential trail for the

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
first zero runs by exploiting the fact

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,160
that only a few number of x-boxes are

58
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,280
used per run at the second step if there

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
are many available plane tests we can

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,520
try to find a pair of them such that

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,920
there is no active xbox in the last

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,040
three runs

63
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,879
of course in our attack with two planned

64
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,920
tests r3 equals to zero as the third

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,319
step we compute the difference of the

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,519
cycle tests and compute the differences

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,920
backwards for our two runs

68
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,239
as the last step we compute the

69
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,640
difference transitions for the middle r1

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,959
runs while solving equations

71
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,000
our tag will rely on two important

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,800
observations on the three bit s box the

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,280
first observation is that for each valid

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,519
non-zero difference transition the

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,840
inputs conforming to such a transition

76
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,560
will form a fine space of dimension y

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,760
and the xbox will be freely linearized

78
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,200
this property also holds for the inverse

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,519
a second important observation is that

80
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,680
for each non-zero input difference

81
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,159
it's valid output differences must form

82
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,800
a fine space of dimension two this also

83
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,640
holds for its inverse

84
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,440
so with observation two in mind

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,000
we can now explain how to compute the

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,680
difference transitions for the middle

87
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,040
hour y runs

88
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,000
us

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,159
the idea is very simple so for these

90
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,159
runs we can introduce intermediate

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,480
variables to represent the output

92
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,640
difference of each s box

93
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,000
then according to the state differences

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,640
computed backwards we can construct

95
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,040
equations in these variables if the

96
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
number of the variables is larger than

97
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,200
the number of uh it's smaller than the

98
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,120
number of equations we can uniquely

99
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,680
determine the difference transitions in

100
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,560
the middle hour one runs and the

101
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,720
the the correctness can be efficiently

102
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,920
checked while the differential

103
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,599
distribution table

104
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,280
then

105
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,360
we can compute the time complexity

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,120
numerator difference as shown in this

107
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,319
slide

108
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,120
so oh there are two other advantages of

109
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,358
the new strategy first the memory

110
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,959
complexity is negligible second it

111
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,479
allows many

112
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,240
many possible differential trails to

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,960
exist which can enlarge the number of

114
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,600
attacked wrongs however we are then

115
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
faced with a natural problem that's how

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,240
to find the correct trial among all the

117
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,280
possible chairs efficiently our solution

118
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,680
to this problem is to efficiently check

119
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,440
whether a possible differential trail

120
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,400
implies a correct key this will use

121
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
observation one so from now on let us

122
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,400
focus on the value transitions uh first

123
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,280
for the last hour three runs uh as all

124
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,840
the xboxes are inactive we can introduce

125
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,080
intermediate variables to represent the

126
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,320
input bit of each export

127
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,759
it works

128
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,320
according to observation one once the

129
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,360
xbox is active the xbox will be freely

130
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,440
linearized and there are two linear

131
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,240
conditions on the output bits

132
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,080
so we can

133
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,039
supposing all the s boxes are active in

134
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,360
the middle rungs we can extract many

135
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,840
linear equations in terms of the key and

136
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,800
the intermediate variables similarly if

137
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,880
the number of equations is larger than

138
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,360
the number of variables we can uniquely

139
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,280
determine the key and the correctness

140
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,680
can be efficiently verified while the

141
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,919
plant has the ciphertext pair

142
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,440
so uh however this will be case some uh

143
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,479
there are active x boxes so we need to

144
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,440
uh compute the complexity uh carefully

145
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,680
and we finally compute the time

146
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,240
complexity to recover the key from all

147
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,840
the trails and indeed the basic idea is

148
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,639
very simple however it is very powerful

149
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,120
uh first it allows us to break one

150
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,000
instance of low mc whose block size is

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,440
much larger than the key size

152
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,000
so as shown in the last row of this

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,360
table

154
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,280
and the second it allows us to break

155
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,759
certain instances of low mcm

156
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,560
then uh we're applying our attack to the

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,479
forerunner loans with a flat xbox layer

158
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,720
used in technique 3 by refining the

159
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,039
attack from work rays of and using the

160
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,080
similar ideas to linearize the uh to

161
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,520
extracting the

162
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,479
linear equations from the active x boxes

163
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,600
and

164
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,520
enumerating differences while solving

165
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
equations we can also break all the

166
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,319
parameters so you can find from this

167
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,720
table that our texts are much efficient

168
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
than the exhaustive key search attack

169
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,000
and the memory complexity is negligible

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,840
so in conclusion the difference

171
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,639
enumeration attack proposed at 2 sec

172
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,440
2018 is significantly improved by

173
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,160
exploiting some properties of the cps

174
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,199
box

175
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,680
second we break the low mc parameters

176
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,240
with tutorial plan tests used in picnic

177
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,880
suite third we break seven instances of

178
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,560
low mcm

179
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,039
at the last we have to emphasize that

180
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,440
our text did not indicate picking x3 is

181
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,520
broken because only one lump

182
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,680
and test the cycle test is known to be

183
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,199
attract that's all thank you

184
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,120
thank you very much

185
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,319
we can move on to the next talk

186
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,850
now which will be given by

187
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,280
[Music]

188
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,800
patrick munger

189
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,400
about the cost to break psych

190
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,319
a comparative hardware-based analysis of

191
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,880
aes and uh sha-3

192
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,800
and it is in collaboration with wen wang

193
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,380
and jakub safa

194
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,449
[Music]

195
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,319
okay thank you for the introduction can

196
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,639
you see my slides

197
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,919
yes

198
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,440
okay perfect

199
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,919
so um so yeah this works uh presents an

200
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,160
analysis of the cost to break psych in

201
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,479
comparison with aes and chat three and

202
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,479
as mentioned uh this is young work with

203
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,639
wang wang and jacob sefer

204
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,160
all right let's start with the summary

205
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,960
of the project uh first of all psyc

206
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,800
that stands for super singular sonic

207
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,360
encapsulation is an alternate candidate

208
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,879
in the third round of the knees post

209
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,479
quantum crypto a cryptography a

210
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,639
standardization process it is the only

211
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,360
isoni based scheming in the competition

212
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,680
uh the harness

213
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,599
the security of the of the scheme is

214
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,280
based on the harness of computing a

215
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,120
large degree so you need between two

216
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,080
isoles elliptic super singular elliptic

217
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,159
curves define our

218
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,799
field of large branch characteristic

219
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,958
now the problem is that despite its

220
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,360
solid security history uh psych is

221
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,959
penalized because its parameters are

222
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,360
chosen very conservatively

223
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,760
using a run model that doesn't take into

224
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,600
account communication uh or memory costs

225
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,839
so what we do in this project is is try

226
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,920
to analyze the security of psyc in

227
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,240
comparison with aes and chatri

228
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,640
which are used to set the

229
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
need security levels using a more

230
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,640
realistic budget-based cost model that

231
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,240
takes into account both computing and

232
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,480
memory costs now the model is further

233
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,720
improved by using historical price data

234
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,399
and the use of a conservative projection

235
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,640
of future costs

236
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
to assist this analysis we also propose

237
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,560
an efficient hardware architecture of

238
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,720
the most intensive computation in the

239
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,880
cryptanalysis in the cryptanalysis of

240
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,240
site that is the

241
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,800
large degree exchanging computation

242
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,279
we use this architecture to model an

243
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,440
asic powered instance of the vanguard

244
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,920
scope winner or vowel parallel collision

245
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,519
finding algorithm and this is the

246
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,680
algorithm that is the most efficient

247
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,519
and efficient one known today to

248
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,000
cryptanalyze psych

249
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,920
let me very briefly summarize the

250
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,600
results that we obtained

251
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,440
before this work there were open

252
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,519
questions about the suitability of some

253
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,760
of the site parameters to match the

254
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
security levels

255
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,800
we answered that question in the

256
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,880
affirmative in our model we showed that

257
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,200
the site monitors are indeed matching

258
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
the security levels and they are

259
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,880
conservative and in fact they offer a

260
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,200
wide margin of security

261
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,240
taking advantage of this margin we go a

262
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,160
step further and then propose new

263
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,320
parameters that fit more closely the

264
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,680
needs targets

265
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,440
these new parameters are still chosen

266
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,839
conservatively and we also report

267
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,360
software implementations of these new

268
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,519
parameters that showcase the significant

269
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,040
gains that could be obtained in

270
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,839
execution time and bandwidth

271
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,760
okay let's go a little bit deeper in the

272
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,800
explanation of the project to set the

273
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,160
the knee security levels in the

274
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,040
classical case uh a simple approach is

275
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,600
followed uh that is based on the query

276
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
complexity and the oracle cost

277
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,000
specifically the oracle cost is taking

278
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,200
in terms of classical gate complexity

279
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,360
one of the uh disadvantages of this

280
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,640
approach is that

281
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,959
sometimes is it can be another way to

282
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,040
establish relative security strength

283
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,000
between certain primitives especially if

284
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
these decrypt analysis of this primitive

285
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,120
uh require large amounts of memory and

286
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,800
that's precisely the case of psych

287
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,760
now let me briefly mention the history

288
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,480
of

289
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,600
parameter selection for psyc in a round

290
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,760
one and three we switched to uh an

291
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,079
analysis that was based on the

292
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,440
vintage bangorscode winner uh algorithm

293
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,480
um

294
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,279
it was switched from uh using the middle

295
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,040
attack that in round one uh was used but

296
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,120
that require large amounts of

297
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
unrealistic amounts of memory

298
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,079
now in uh the the the issue with the

299
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,640
bandwidth code winner algorithm and you

300
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,160
can see the execution time that is

301
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,480
showing the screen requires uh

302
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,800
it has a memory parameter there that is

303
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,240
called w

304
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,480
and for simplification purposes that

305
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,160
parameter was fixed to 2 to the 80.

306
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,839
we can already mention a couple of

307
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,079
problems with that with that analysis

308
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,519
first of all there is no fundamental

309
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,040
reason to fix w to do the 80.

310
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,680
and second in some cases the security

311
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,040
estimates

312
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
obtained with the analysis were still

313
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,000
below the nis classical day requirements

314
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,160
so what we do is to try to address these

315
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,279
problems with a budget-based cost model

316
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,360
basically what it does is fix a budget

317
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,839
for the attacker distribute the money to

318
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,360
get both computing and storage resources

319
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,800
such a way that

320
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,560
the time to break the algorithm is

321
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,320
minimized and then the security of the

322
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
scheme is estimated as the time it takes

323
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,760
to break it

324
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,839
this approach has been already used in

325
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,680
the literature before but we improve it

326
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,160
as as as i mentioned at the start of the

327
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
presentation

328
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,240
now uh very briefly

329
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,880
let me jump to the to do a summary of

330
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,639
the results that we obtained we did an

331
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,480
analysis for many

332
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,959
uh budgets up to one trillion dollars

333
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,000
here

334
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,240
to illustrate the the results i show the

335
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,440
case of one 100 billion dollars

336
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,000
in the graph you can see on the y-axis

337
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,079
the logarithm of the number of years

338
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,399
that it takes to break an algorithm

339
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,760
or primitive

340
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,279
and then the x

341
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,279
we do the analysis uh for the years

342
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,480
between 2000 up to 2040.

343
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,200
so in red you can see the uh the

344
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,680
security estimates for aes corresponding

345
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,279
to levels 1 3 and 5 as defined by nest

346
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,240
and then

347
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
the corresponding

348
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,160
side parameters are in blue and as you

349
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,480
can see

350
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,000
as promised

351
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,399
we showed that the in in our model the

352
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,800
psychometers do fulfill the these

353
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,880
requirements in fact they offer a very

354
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,519
wide margin of security

355
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,279
so taking in

356
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,199
you know advantage of this wide margin

357
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,600
is that we try to find parameters that

358
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,639
follow more closely the nist security

359
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,880
levels and you can see the

360
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,320
the um the new parameters are shown in

361
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,519
the in blue also with the label new

362
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,480
in the in the graph

363
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,199
all right so um just to finish this

364
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,839
presentation i want to show some results

365
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,160
that show the performance

366
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,079
of the the potential performance of the

367
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,760
new parameters in comparison with around

368
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,680
three parameters in this table you can

369
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,560
see the performance on the right of the

370
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,240
of the alternative parameters that we

371
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,880
propose on the left uh the

372
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,279
round three parameters you can see that

373
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,199
in terms of bandwidth we obtain a very

374
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,800
nice reduction uh the pk column in terms

375
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,000
of bytes we can see a reduction that

376
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,920
arguably could make

377
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,000
psych even more attractive in terms of

378
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,040
bandwidth

379
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,199
and then we also show the performance in

380
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,519
millions of cycles again a very nice

381
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,639
reduction

382
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,480
for example for level one we show a

383
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,480
speed up of about 1.4 times um

384
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,800
in in performance which

385
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
it's a very welcoming speed up given

386
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,920
that site is relatively slow

387
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,440
and with that i i'm going to finish this

388
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,720

399
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,760
last talk of this session

400
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
which is about improved torsion point

401
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,800
attacks on the side variants

402
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,639
the talk will be given by peter kotasch

403

408
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,959
thank you can you see my slides

409
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,720
yes

410
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,839
okay

411
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,759
so thank you um

412
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,880
yeah so

413
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,959
hi i'm pierre kotash and i'm going to

414
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,399
talk about improved torsion plate

415
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,880
attacks on sidh variants

416
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,120
which as stated before is a joint work

417
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,079
with victoria dakar chris leonardi floyd

418
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,560
martin daily and pony crystal petty and

419
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,279
catherine stein

420
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,680
so i started the base crypto is based on

421
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,600
the hardness of finding misogynist

422
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,920
between super simulative curves

423
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,240
but uh most crypto systems are based on

424
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,720
weaker assumptions or at least seemingly

425
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,560
weaker assumptions

426
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,519
so it's important to to study these

427
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,000
new and different heart problems

428
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,639
especially in sidh there's the issue of

429
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
torsion point images

430
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,199
and the fact that the starting curve

431
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,240
is special in a sense and

432
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,680
one can look at the following problem

433
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,920
which without the ssit problem which is

434
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,800
a variant of the

435
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,560
cssi problem

436
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,240
is that uh

437
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,040
let phi be an isogeny uh going from e to

438
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,199
ea uh of known degree a which is secret

439
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,079
and suppose furthermore that uh you know

440
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,600
phi pb and phi qb where pb and qb uh

441
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,680
generate the b portion of the starting

442
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,359
curve e

443
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,039
and the problem is to compute the

444
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,959
isogenic phi

445
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,720
and our main goal is to give certain

446
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,559
conditions on a b and p

447
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,160
where p is the characteristic of the

448
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
underlying field on when we can solve

449
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,599
this problem

450
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,599
either in polynomial time or at least

451
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,160
one can be the generic algorithms which

452
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,199
don't use torsion points at all

453
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,720
the there is a very important previous

454
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,120
work in this direction by the t at the

455
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,520
from 2017 asia crypt

456
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,960
which provides a polynomial time

457
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,200
algorithm for this problem whenever b is

458
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,799
bigger than p square a square

459
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,080
so what are the key ideas of our work uh

460
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,400
so the main idea is to utilize the

461
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
uh the endomorphism equals the starting

462
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,039
curve in a certain fashion then we

463
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,919
look for an endomorphism a theta and

464
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,400
some integer d such that uh

465
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,520
phi theta phi hat plus d uh which we

466
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,039
thought was tau

467
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,720
has the special property that this

468
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,919
degree is very close whether to b square

469
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,840
or to b square p

470
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,679
meaning that it's either b square e or b

471
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,640
square t times e over e is small

472
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
and uh if that's the case then we show

473
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,039
that uh you can compute tau

474
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,799
and from tao you can actually recover

475
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,840
the isogenic phi uh quite easily by

476
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,280
looking at the intersection of the

477
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,440
kernel of tau minus d with

478
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
the eighth version

479
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,480
of the target curve

480
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,240
which will give you essentially the dual

481
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,919
phi

482
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,840
so the the key and hard problem here in

483
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,679
this this approach is how do you find

484
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,160
such an endomorphism theta

485
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,720
and uh we deal with the special case

486
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,080
where the starting curve has chain

487
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,039
variant 17 28 which is essentially

488
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,600
used in most applications and then this

489
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,760
problem reduces to a very

490
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,360
certain diaphragm time quadratic

491
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,080
diaphragm time equations and the key

492
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,919
here is when we can solve them

493
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,600
efficiently

494
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,160
and our main result is a polynomial time

495
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,679
algorithm

496
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,000
for the case where either b is bigger

497
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,400
than square root of p times a square

498
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,600
or b is bigger than g times a

499
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,760
and uh of course so these are polynomial

500
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
time solutions but one can look at again

501
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,919
as to two exponential time algorithms

502
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:16,799
which

503
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,640
which are still better than engineering

504
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,600
in the middle

505
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,160
algorithms and then what then parameters

506
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,039
can actually be relaxed so let me show

507
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,840
you two diagrams of how uh this attack

508
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,240
compares to cathedral agent work

509
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,480
so in this diagram you have two axes

510
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,360
alpha and beta which where a is modeled

511
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,600
as being equal to p to the alpha and v

512
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,919
is modeled as p to the beta and you want

513
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,760
certain conditions between alpha and v

514
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,400
and then you can

515
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,240
solve the problem in polynomial time

516
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,320
which is uh represented by a red line in

517
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,520
the red area and or just being better

518
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,039
than generic attacks which is

519
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,760
represented by the orange line

520
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,080
but there are two special dotted lines

521
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,280
connecting

522
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,760
uh the line connecting the two ones that

523
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,200
corresponds to sidh-like parameters

524
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,640
where a times b is wrapped in p

525
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,559
and the dotted line connecting the two

526
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,400
twos corresponds to b side like

527
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,240
parameters which are which is a variant

528
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,600
of s i d h

529
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,880
where p square is uh equals to a times b

530
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,280
or is roughly eight times b uh i

531
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,000
emphasize that these are like sidh-like

532
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,679
and b-side-like parameters because

533
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,280
they're not necessarily

534
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,520
uh balanced as in as an s-i-v-h or

535
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,039
b-side

536
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,039
this was the situation in the tuesday

537
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,200
and as you can see our work

538
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,000
has substantially improved uh

539
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,679
the original method of petty as you can

540
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,240
see much larger portion of the parameter

541
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
space is covered so you have the same

542
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,400
notations red line above this form your

543
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,679
time attacks

544
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,600
orange and above is better than generic

545
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
attacks and then there's an extra yellow

546
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,159
line

547
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,919
which we analyzed in this work which are

548
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,080
better than known quantum attacks

549
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,440
and as you can see

550
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,559
our work

551
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,600
affects

552
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,480
certain unbalanced choices of sid h and

553
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,400
b-side-like perimeters

554
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,760
so the main highlight of our work is uh

555
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,640
is a polynomial time break whenever

556
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,280
a times b is roughly p and b is bigger

557
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,799
than a to the fifth

558
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,320
which breaks a certain group key

559
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,360
exchange

560
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,679
with six or more parties which was

561
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,200
deemed to be secure

562
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,960
for 400 parties

563
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,159
we also propose a different line of work

564
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,559
so uh

565
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,559
all previous really mentioned work uh

566
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,960
supposes that the starting curve is uh

567
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,280
very special with chain variants 17 28

568
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,440
but one can ask the question better

569
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,120
what happens if an adversary is allowed

570
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,960
to choose the starting curve

571
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,200
can can one specifically design starting

572
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,159
curves for which one can solve the

573
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,720
the ssid problem or bake break inside

574
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,640
the edge in polynomial time or at least

575
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,280
uh faster than generic algorithms

576
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,440
and uh whenever b is bigger than a

577
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,679
square then the answer is affirmative

578
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,600
then there is a polynomial time

579
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,360
algorithm

580
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,240
uh

581
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
which cons so what someone can actually

582
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,919
construct these special starting curves

583
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,000
from which we can solve ssid in

584
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
polynomial time

585
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,919
and note that uh

586
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,840
this condition is completely independent

587
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,919
of piece all previous conditions involve

588
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,640
p but this is this

589
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,080
only uses the unbalance between b and a

590
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,480
furthermore if uh

591
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,559
even for balanced parameters meaning

592
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,640
that where a's are roughly the same size

593
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,520
as b

594
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,600
one can construct these special

595
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,679
factor occurs from which one can solve

596
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,840
ssid at least faster than meeting the

597
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,559
middle and uh we also counted these

598
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,559
these curves and

599
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,640
we believe that these uh backdoor curves

600
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,720
are hard to distinguish from from random

601
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,840
curves

602
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,000
so in conclusion we have

603
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,520
provided significant improvements in

604
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,679
previous algorithms we break a

605
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,280
group key exchange with six or more

606
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,720
parties

607
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,320
we also provide an implementation for

608
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,280
that

609
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,120
uh we introduced the the concept of

610
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,960
backdoor curves

611
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,880
and the main takeaway from our result is

612
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,200
that you shouldn't use severely

613
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,240
unbalanced parameters in sidh

614
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,320
so siph is fine because the scientist

615
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,120
uses bounce parameters

616
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,799
and you shouldn't trust starting curves

617
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,640
coming from unknown or shady sources

618
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,960
thank you

619
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,880
thank you

620
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,240
so we can move on to the q a session

621
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,559
there's already a question in the chat

622
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,880
which is for patrick longa

623
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,120
the question is in the graph that shows

624
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,280
the estimate the estimated the psych

625
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,400
versus aes attack costs over time

626
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,559
the slope for psych was slightly

627
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,960
different from the slope for aes

628
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,720
and what's the reason for that

629
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,440
um yeah so um

630
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,159
well the in the in the graph we show to

631
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,400
to recall we show the analysis for

632
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,960
different uh for different years so we

633
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,000
go from

634
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,279
2000 up to 2040 and as they as the

635
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,120
as the

636
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,559
time evolves

637
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,559
then it becomes slightly easier to to to

638
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,480
attack to attack psych

639
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,720
and uh

640
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,200
and yeah and that's why you see uh

641
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,960
uh uh uh

642
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,120
relatively you know uh faster

643
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,400
degradation and security uh as the as

644
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,799
the time goes

645
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,240
okay

646
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,480
um

647
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,559
so maybe i'll ask you a question as well

648
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,480
so i i don't know that area very well

649
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,559
but you use the

650
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,799
van or shoot winner

651
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,000
collision search that's your basis

652
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,960
um

653
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,039
there exists in principle quantum

654
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,360
collision search algorithms

655
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,799
with the

656
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,960
did you not consider would they not help

657
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,120
or your formula attack sorry you said

658
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,320
one domain

659
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,640
you use the final fruit wiener

660
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,440
alcoholism search algorithm uh

661
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,840
what how would the quantum collision

662
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
behave of course there are issues

663
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,559
because it depends how you

664
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,840
treat

665
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,400
quantum memory but would that be

666
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,200
relevant at all or not at all yeah so in

667
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,799
the in the paper we analyzed the

668
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,840
classical case uh that's why we we

669
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,799
mostly focus on on the vowel algorithm

670
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,480
for the quantum algorithm algorithms we

671
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,760
rely on

672
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,640
the analysis done by other authors

673
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,559
experts in quantum security and quantum

674
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,720
algorithms so so we basically use a

675
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,799
state-of-the-art analysis that is has

676
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,120
been known for as ideas and psych

677
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,120
and we do a summary in our work um

678
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,039
you know showing all the all the

679
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,440
state-of-the-art results and take that

680
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,279
into account to still show that uh

681
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,919
the psychoparameters are are safe to use

682
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,159
with those with those uh indicate in the

683
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,159
case of the quantum

684
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,640
quantum algorithms but we don't do the

685
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,720
data analysis in the paper make sense

686
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,080
okay thank you

687
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,159
that's actually another question for you

688
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,200
in the in the

689
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,000
zoom chat

690
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,159
which points out that sometimes you have

691
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,960
estimates that

692
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,799
it would take a certain point in time it

693
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,799
might take a very long time to

694
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,279
to find to solve the problem but 20

695
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,840
years later it might take uh just not

696
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,080
the same time minus 20. it might take

697
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,480
actually much less than that

698
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,799
which seems inconsistent right

699
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,640
so at time n you would have an estimate

700
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,720
that is a list e and then a type

701
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,760
n

702
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,840
t plus 20 you have an estimate that is a

703
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,039
more that is less than

704
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,880
e minus 20. if that makes sense okay i

705
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,919
see and uh

706
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,080
why is that considering consistent i

707
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,880
don't get the because uh if in 20 years

708
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,400
so the example the issue 20 years you

709
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,159
can break it in million years

710
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,400
then right now you could make it in a in

711
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,799
a million years plus 20.

712
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,480
so if your estimate right now is

713
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,840
trillion years that's the example that's

714
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,320
given then

715
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,279
okay so yeah

716
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,159
yeah okay so i think the question goes

717
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,039
in the direction of uh then why don't we

718
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,440
wait those 20 years and run the other

719
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,520
from there okay i see i see um so yeah

720
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,679
that's that's that that's possible if

721
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,919
the attacker wants to do that and now i

722
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,120
should mention at this point that all

723
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,080
these models even though they try to um

724
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,159
to approximate reality

725
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,120
they are

726
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,600
far-fetched still very far from from

727
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,159
reality so what we try so in any of

728
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,000
these models that try to approximate

729
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,399
security we have to consider that there

730
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,320
is some parameter variable that is

731
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,960
completely unrealistic so for example in

732
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,520
in our model uh

733
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,840
you can see that yeah you take uh you

734
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,279
take the the point of view of the

735
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,919
attacker then you assume you have

736
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,559
certain budget and then measure the time

737
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,080
that it takes to break the algorithm but

738
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,840
because these are cryptographically

739
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,000
strong algorithms it's gonna take you

740
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,159
know millions of years to break it and

741
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,120
that's

742
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,919
of course unrealistic right you can you

743
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,559
know turn the tables and then assume

744
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,880
that for example you have unrealistic

745
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,159
amounts of

746
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,039
money to try to achieve realistic

747
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,440
timelines but again there is always in

748
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,039
the model something that is going to be

749
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,360
totally totally unrealistic right and

750
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,039
that's the way it is right the only

751
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,360
thing that we want to do is to try to to

752
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,200
take a more

753
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,320
from my perspective natural approach uh

754
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,960
taking the point of view that the attack

755
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,520
has to be realized either today or let's

756
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,000
say in a few decades from now and then

757
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,039
try to

758
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,880
have a sense of the strength of the

759
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,600
algorithm by estimating the resources

760
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,720
that uh it would be required to run that

761
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,919
that that attack but again yeah uh at

762
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,600
some point there should be some kind of

763
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,440
convention uh because as i said uh

764
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,360
whatever model you use is gonna be to a

765
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,120
certain degree uh unrealistic

766
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,480
yeah that makes sense so i guess maybe

767
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,760
you could say

768
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,000
that you estimate uh how long the attack

769
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,520
would take if it used the technology

770
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,600
from that date

771
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,120
if you started at that date with the

772
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,559
technology available at that date

773
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,039
um to do a projection of the kind of

774
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,720
technology that

775
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,840
that

776
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,159
can be available and and and you know

777
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,840
follow the for example

778
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,960
uh moore's law to to track the uh the um

779
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,760
the improvements uh in technology uh

780
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,159
that could be expected in in some years

781
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,880
from now uh if you go more than a few

782
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,919
decades then i suppose the you know it's

783
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,159
extremely hard to do any any reasonable

784
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,640
estimates but we still assume that our

785
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,440
our

786
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,919
uh estimates are conservative because

787
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,640
more law is is um degrading they're

788
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,360
degradating with with time right this is

789
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,520
slowing down uh and that's what i've

790
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,120
been seeing in the in the last few years

791
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,480
so we take into

792
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,919
account that to

793
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,080
assume that uh our estimates can be can

794
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,559
be seen as conservative

795
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,080
yes thank you very much

796
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,679
good actually

797
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,360
we're reaching the end of the session

798
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,440
maybe i'd just like to ask a really

799
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,279
quick question to uh

800
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,720
let me check

801
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,919
to see other speakers uh so fukungu just

802
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,480
a quick question um your attack is in

803
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,039
some way similar to attacks that use the

804
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,039
targeted ciphers with none

805
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,960
with partial linear layers

806
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,200
uh do any of your ids could they be like

807
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,840
sort of back posted to uh

808
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,960
to

809
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,880
do the cryptanesis of ciphers with

810
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,039
partial non-neon layers

811
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,399
so in other words the attack has some

812
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,640
similarities could some of your ideas be

813
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,200
applied to those ciphers as well

814
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,919
or are they too specific to try to watch

815
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:02,640
so

816
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,559
some of your attacks although they apply

817
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,200
to low mc they are similar to attacks to

818
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,880
ideas that were used to

819
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,120
cryptanalysis for the kubernetes of

820
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,320
generally

821
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,158
cyphers with partial neon layers

822
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,200
uh also could some of your ideas be

823
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,840
applied to other ciphers with non-linear

824
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
with partial knowledge yeah yeah i think

825
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,880
it can be uh it can be applied to the

826
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,919
general

827
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,720
uh design strategy so using a partial

828
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,320
nonlinear but

829
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
the critical also

830
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,960
the the main advantage of our tag is to

831
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,000
utilize some uh important properties of

832
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,840
the three bit xbox

833
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,200
so if you want to attack the general so

834
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,679
the general design strategy may be uh

835
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,200
the

836
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,440
so you can just follow the

837
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,399
uh the

838
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,320
the original difference in numeration

839
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,000
attack so that in that we are the the

840
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,080
the property of the xbox is not utilized

841
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,080
yeah i see so you rely on the three bit

842
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,279
xbox yeah okay thank you it makes sense

843
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,440
yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah let me make

844
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,600
a quick quick question for peter

845
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,039
so i really don't know anything about

846
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,320
azure journeys so it might be a very

847
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,159
nice question but

848
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,559
is there any hope that your your attack

849
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,919
applies to

850
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,640
sidh but not the basic one some variants

851
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,519
of it

852
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,200
like their only hope that you could

853
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,080
apply could be modified to apply to

854
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,039
sight completely

855
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,519
out of the frame

856
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,200
that's a hard question

857
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,840
so

858
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,640
so so far we are we are a little bit far

859
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,559
away from from balance to sideways

860
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,360
parameters but uh but

861
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,840
the the improvement is is quite last so

862
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,600
there there is so

863
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,320
so

864
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,240
the jump from from from the original

865
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
attack to this one was quite a big one

866
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,200
but uh but we're still quite far away

867
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,760
um

868
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,360
so i don't know so it depends on the

869
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,519
so

870
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,840
we are we're we're still

871
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,039
so so

872
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,799
so they're not too many unbalanced

873
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,320
variants in the literature there are

874
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,640
some and and people

875
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,519
uh

876
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,200
and they

877
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,120
people have are keep suggesting new

878
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,559
variants

879
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,480
uh without balance but i would advise

880
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
against uh

881
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,960
against against those because i think we

882
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,200
are getting quite close to i say

883
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,760
parameters where uh

884
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,360
b is only like uh

885
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,880
roughly the size of a square or

886
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,760
something like that

887
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,200
plus

888
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,000
there is a variant of sidh which uh

889
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,840
which somehow uses a random starting

890
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,039
curve

891
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,039
which would counteract

892
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,158
these types of attacks

893
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,320
that that is very far away with these

894
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,000
attacks i think i think the

895
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,039
i i

896
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,719
i don't think these attacks pose a

897
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,040
security concern at the moment

898
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,320
for psych

899
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,879
but uh at least

900
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,199
might lead to the fact that as

901
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,560
uh psycho

902
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,480
might have to switch to

903
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,159
say a starting curve which is generate

904
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,199
the friendly in the not so near future i

905
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,719
would say

906
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,960
but that might be told

907
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,079
okay

908
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,839
so thank you very much

909
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,520
so there's actually one last question

910
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,760
but we're already five minutes over the

911
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,000
limits so maybe uh

912
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,599
it's a question for patrick longer maybe

913
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,079
you could answer it in the in the chat

914
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,000
if that's okay with my apologies to

915
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,239
about 7
