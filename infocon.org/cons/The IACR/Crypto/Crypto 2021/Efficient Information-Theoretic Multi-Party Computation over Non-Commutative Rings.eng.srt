1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,399
hi everyone and welcome to this talk on

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,919
efficient information theoretic

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,440
multi-party computation over

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,200
non-commutative rings which is joint

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,840
work with daniel scudero from august

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,000
university

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,519
so first of all let's define what's

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,599
multi-party computation multi-party

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,600
computation allows a set of mutually

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,160
distrusting parties to compute on their

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,840
private data

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,480
and a classical example for this is the

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,439
millionaire's problem where there's four

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,519
parties here in the picture who want to

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,880
know who's the richest among themselves

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,680
and

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,000
they don't want to reveal their wealth

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,600
to each other

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,360
so a way to solve this problem without

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,640
cryptography

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,160
would be to

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,079
appeal to some trusted third party

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,480
to which they could send their inputs

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,559
this party would carry the computation

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,920
on their behalf

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,680
and just return the answer back to them

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,199
this is the ideal world that might not

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,079
be

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,719
visible in reality so what multi-party

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,560
computation does is replacing this ideal

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,560
world functionality

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,400
with a set of

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,119
cryptographic techniques so parties are

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,520
going to exchange messages according to

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,119
some protocol

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,000
and

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,320
the issue here is that

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,799
there's corrupted parties participating

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,840
in the protocol

40
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,479
so we will say that our protocol will be

41
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,680
secure

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,560
as long as it is indistinguishable from

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,119
this ideal world with the transfer party

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,680
since there are many kinds of npc

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,560
protocols let us narrow the scope to the

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,439
ones

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,520
in this work

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,840
so we will be dealing with an adversary

49
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,680
that might actively deviate from the

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,399
protocol specification and which is more

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,720
over unbounded in terms of computational

52
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,000
power

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,079
due to this we need to restrict

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,439
ourselves to a scenario where less than

55
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,399
half of the parties will be corrupted

56
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,560
and we will also look at this scenario

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,080
where less than a third of the parties

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,919
are corrupted

59
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,120
and since we have this restriction in

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
the contraption first of all

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,080
we can achieve

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,560
warranted output delivery or robustness

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,239
if you are more familiar with that term

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,080
and in terms of

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,920
of the model of computation we will

66
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,879
follow the offline online paradigm or

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,319
pre-processing online paradigm

68
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,360
and

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,120
we will base our results on the secret

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,319
sharing

71
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,200
over a non-commutative ring r

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,519
so this allows us to compute arithmetic

73
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,040
circuits over

74
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,840
uh

75
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,560
a non-commutative ring r

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,400
and i i have a small footnote here

77
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
to bring up that our work could be

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
easily adapted

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,879
to deal with mixed circuits where some

80
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,120
gates would be

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,200
over a non-commutative ring such as a

82
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,640
matrix ring

83
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,599
and the other wires and gates could be

84
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,720
over the ring that this matrix ring is

85
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,200
defined

86
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
since our work will be based on a

87
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
generalization of shamir's linear secret

88
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,200
sharing scheme to non-communicative

89
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,799
rings let us begin by reviewing this

90
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,080
construction of our finite fields

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
imagine four parties wanted to share

92
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,159
some secret why over the finite field

93
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,920
with eight elements

94
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,319
here in our example c square plus c

95
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,200
what

96
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,400
they could do

97
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,680
is sampling a polynomial of degree equal

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
to the maximum amount of corrupted

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,840
parties among themselves

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,760
in such a way that this polynomial

101
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,080
evaluates to the secret y

102
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,760
at some fixed public point alpha 0 which

103
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,799
is 0 here in the example

104
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,280
once this is done

105
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,799
by fixing

106
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,680
other public values alpha 1 up to alpha

107
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,720
4

108
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,599
each of them corresponding to parties 1

109
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,200
to 4

110
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,879
we have defined

111
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,079
their share of the secret y as the

112
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,399
evaluation of the polynomial p

113
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,440
at this point alpha i

114
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,560
so

115
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,040
in we will use this double bracket

116
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,240
notation

117
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,120
to define the secret sharing

118
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,680
of the value y

119
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
and sometimes we will have this sub

120
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,720
index t to denote the degree of the

121
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,560
polynomial that was used to share the

122
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,639
secret

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,639
we know that this protocol is secure

124
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,040
because t plus one points are needed in

125
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,360
order to reconstruct a polynomial of

126
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,840
degree t and we only have t corrupted

127
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,280
parties

128
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,240
so

129
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,560
what happens when we actually want them

130
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,320
to come together and find the secret

131
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,440
well

132
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,800
things are a little bit more complicated

133
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,000
than just

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,919
trying to interpolate

135
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,479
but the good news for us is that shamir

136
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,440
secret sharing scheme is a read solomon

137
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,400
code

138
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,080
so parties can announce their

139
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,560
evaluations of the polynomial

140
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,960
and then they will try to interpolate

141
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,560
and

142
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,320
depending on the corruption threshold

143
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,560
they will be able to do either error

144
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,440
detection or error correction

145
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,400
and

146
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,520
thus find the secret or detect if the

147
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
adversary is trying to

148
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,120
abort this

149
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,600
reconstruction procedure

150
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,360
and something that is very important

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,240
here

152
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,520
to note

153
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,120
is that

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,560
in order to do this interpolation

155
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,280
parties need to compute the inverse of

156
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,080
the differences between their public

157
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,840
values alpha i

158
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,919
and this works perfectly fine when you

159
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,919
are in a finite field

160
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,600
but we will see that this is more

161
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,280
complicated in more general rings

162
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,120
before moving to more general structures

163
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,720
let's have a look at some properties of

164
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,639
shamir's scheme

165
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,919
first of all

166
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,080
chemist's scheme is linear meaning that

167
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
we can multiply a secret with a public

168
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,160
scalar by locally computing the product

169
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,680
between the scalar and the shares

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,160
moreover we can do this on both sides

171
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,639
and add the results together resulting

172
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,600
on

173
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,000
what you would expect

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,639
so what's formally happening here

175
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,880
is that the vector of evaluations of a

176
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,199
degree t polynomial is a vector space

177
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,600
another interesting property is a strong

178
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,120
multiplicativity

179
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,360
meaning here that

180
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,800
given two degree t sharings of secrets x

181
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,199
and y

182
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,479
a degree 2t sharing of x times y can be

183
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,400
locally computed as a component wise

184
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,840
multiplication of the vector of

185
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,759
shares and crucially both of these

186
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,479
properties are enabled by the fact that

187
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,520
the

188
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,360
polynomial evaluation

189
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,520
at some fixed point alpha is a ring

190
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,039
homomorphism

191
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,639
meaning it doesn't matter whether you

192
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,800
first evaluate two polynomials

193
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,120
and then you add them together

194
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,080
or if you first sum the polynomials and

195
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
you evaluate afterwards

196
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,479
and the same property for the product of

197
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,120
polynomials

198
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,599
prior to our work a spoiler role show

199
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,759
how to generalize shamir based protocols

200
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,759
to commutative rings

201
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,680
we won't spend much time reviewing the

202
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,720
result

203
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,360
but the main takeaway from their work is

204
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,520
that as long as the set of evaluation

205
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,240
points has the exceptional property

206
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,400
field-based protocols carry over to

207
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,879
commutative rings

208
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,199
we say that a set is exceptional if the

209
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,199
difference of any two elements is

210
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,199
invertible

211
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,199
if you remember this is a property we

212
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,440
had for granted in finite fields but the

213
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,520
presence of zero divisors makes it more

214
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,680
difficult over rings

215
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
as an example consider the ring of

216
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,080
integers modulo 2 to the k which has no

217
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,199
exceptional set of size bigger than two

218
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,840
this is due to the fact that any set of

219
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,199
three elements

220
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,120
will contain two elements with the same

221
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,680
parity so their difference is going to

222
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
be a multiple of two and hence a zero

223
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,319
divisor

224
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,319
the solution to this problem is the same

225
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,280
as when we want to compute over f2

226
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,080
namely we move to a gall extension of

227
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,240
the integers modulo 2 to the k

228
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,000
there is of degree logarithmic in the

229
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,039
number of parties the result is known as

230
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,279
a galway ring and for the purpose of

231
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,200
this talk the only thing you need to

232
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
understand is that exceptionally bigger

233
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,040
exceptional

234
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
sorry exponentially bigger exceptional

235
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,600
sets can be found by moving to these

236
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,680
extensions

237
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,760
we are now ready to define xiaomi's

238
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,600
secret sharing over non-commutative

239
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,880
rings

240
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,080
but

241
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,560
before that we need to understand

242
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,480
how two polynomials look when their

243
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
coefficients are in a non-commutative

244
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,720
ring

245
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,040
so as mathematicians we will just pick

246
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,120
the definition that best suits our

247
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,320
interests

248
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,959
in our case we will uniquely define a

249
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,680
degree d polynomial as the formal sum of

250
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,440
d plus one coefficients in the

251
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,000
non-commutative ring and powers from

252
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,959
zero up to d of an indeterminate x

253
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,160
addition in this ring works as in the

254
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,760
commutative case

255
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
but multiplication will look a bit

256
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,720
different

257
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,640
as we want to keep the invariant of

258
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,240
expressing polynomials as above

259
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,200
in order to do this we will artificially

260
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,760
make the indeterminate commute with the

261
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,880
coefficients of the polynomial

262
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,120
so for example

263
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,760
p1x times q1x

264
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,440
will result on

265
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,279
p1 times q1 times x squared rather than

266
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,360
p1 times x times q1 times x

267
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,160
as a result polynomial evaluation is no

268
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,800
longer a ring of morphism in particular

269
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,560
we have broken the multiplicative group

270
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,040
on homomorphism

271
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,399
for a general alpha

272
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,560
you might ask why do we define

273
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,720
polynomials in this seemingly arbitrary

274
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,600
way

275
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,760
and the reason is that we need this in

276
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
order to prove a series of results

277
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,839
leading to error detection and error

278
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,200
correction

279
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,120
and even prior to that

280
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,640
unique polynomial interpolation

281
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,800
actually we will have two different

282
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,560
evaluation maps

283
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,480
which replace indeterminate with the

284
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,279
point alpha either on the left or the

285
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,800
right hand side of the coefficients

286
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
depending on the choice of the

287
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,640
evaluation map we interpolate to

288
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
different polynomials

289
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,880
and also depending on this choice we

290
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,279
will have either a left module or a

291
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,240
right module structure

292
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,120
again the key thing to have in mind here

293
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,200
is that this is for an arbitrary alpha

294
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,519
so once again the most important aspect

295
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,279
for shamir secret sharing will be the

296
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,200
properties of the set of evaluation

297
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,399
points

298
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,560
we know from prior work that this set

299
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,480
has to be exceptional

300
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,880
over a non-commutative ring we will

301
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,399
additionally have two different cases

302
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,880
either this set is contained on the

303
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,040
center of the ring in which case

304
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,200
everything works essentially the same

305
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,760
way as over finite fields

306
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
or if we relax the commutative

307
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,600
requirements for these alphas

308
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,040
so that they only need to commute with

309
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,160
each other

310
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,240
we obtain secret sharing schemes which

311
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,320
are not multiplicative

312
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,880
and which will be linear either on the

313
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
left hand side or the right hand side

314
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
according to the choice of the

315
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
evaluation map as we show

316
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,639
on the previous slide

317
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,360
we are then presented with a trader

318
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,760
if we look for example at the ring of n

319
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,160
times m matrices over the integers

320
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,839
modulo 2 to the k

321
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,680
the biggest exceptional set that is

322
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,839
contained in the center of this ring has

323
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,360
size 2

324
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,760
whereas in the more relaxed setting

325
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,920
since the degree m gamma extension of

326
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,399
the integers modulo 2 to the k is a

327
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,440
commutative sub ring of this ring of

328
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
matrices

329
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,680
we can find a suitable

330
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,000
exceptional set

331
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,880
with this relaxed commutative property

332
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,240
of size 2 to the m

333
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,120
most of our work looks at this scenario

334
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,959
since if we were to emulate the

335
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,279
arithmetic of this matrix ring using

336
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,720
prior work

337
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,880
that would basically require using a

338
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,200
gala ring a galway ring element

339
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,920
for each entry of the matrix ring even

340
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,959
though this can be amortized using some

341
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,680
prior works

342
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,839
now that we have our secret sharing

343
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,320
scheme let's see how the online phase of

344
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,519
our protocols looks like

345
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,279
linear operations will be local

346
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,720
according to the modular structure

347
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,480
inherited by the choice of the set of

348
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
evaluation points

349
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,240
if these are contained in the center of

350
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,720
the ring we have a bimodule and

351
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,920
everything works as over finite fields

352
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,240
if the evaluation points just commit

353
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,519
with each other

354
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,160
we have a left module which we denote

355
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,240
with these straight brackets if

356
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,480
interpolation is according to evaluation

357
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,079
on the right

358
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,160
and we have a right module which we

359
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,480
denote with angle brackets

360
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,079
if we interpolate according to

361
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,399
evaluation on the left

362
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,480
as usual multiplication will be more

363
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
complicated and we will use some

364
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,000
pre-process randomness for that

365
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,560
let's review some standard protocols for

366
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,440
multiplying secret shared values x and y

367
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,000
the first one uses double shares which

368
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,240
are sharings of the same random value

369
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,720
are using a degree t and a degree 2t

370
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,399
polynomial

371
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,560
due to the multiplicative property

372
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,480
parties can locally compute the degree

373
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,199
2t sharing of x times y from their

374
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,120
degree t shares of x and y

375
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,920
using the degree 2t sharing of r as a

376
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,360
mask they can reconstruct x times y plus

377
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,720
r

378
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,360
and from that they obtain a degree t

379
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,480
sharing of x times y using the remaining

380
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,320
share

381
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
this approach will fail unless the

382
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
evaluation points are contained in the

383
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,760
center of the ring

384
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,680
since that is needed for polynomial

385
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,199
evaluation to be a ring homomorphism

386
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,800
when we are in a non-community ring

387
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,440
the second approach uses beaver triples

388
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,279
for which we do not rely on the

389
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,279
multiplicative property of the secret

390
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,360
sharing scheme

391
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,120
nevertheless

392
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,279
this approach also fails if the

393
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,360
evaluation points are not in the center

394
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,199
in the ring

395
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,680
since that is the only way we can have a

396
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,239
pi module

397
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,720
finally the first working solution in

398
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
this challenging setting will be to

399
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,040
enhance beaver triples with additional

400
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,360
correlated randomness

401
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,800
the first step

402
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,440
looks as in the classic procedure but in

403
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,120
order to overcome

404
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,639
the lack of a bimodal structure

405
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,959
we will need an intermediate step as

406
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,120
shown on the slide

407
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,120
the issue with this approach is that it

408
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,040
doubles the round complexity of the

409
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,199
online phase

410
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,079
nevertheless in the paper we show how to

411
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,720
go back to the usual run complexity by

412
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,959
employing some function dependent

413
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,360
preprocessing so i invite you to check

414
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,320
that out

415
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,959
only

416
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,880
i will conclude this talk by showing how

417
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
to produce the pre-processing material

418
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,279
for the case when the evaluation points

419
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,199
are not contained in the center of the

420
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,560
ring

421
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,040
i will show two different protocols

422
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
the first one is black box on the choice

423
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,399
of the ring

424
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,160
and the second one will be more

425
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,360
practical and restricted to the case of

426
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,240
matrix rings

427
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,040
the black box preprocessing is based on

428
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,360
representing elements of the ring r as

429
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,279
elements of the group of three times

430
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,320
three invertible matrices over r

431
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,199
namely an element a in r will be

432
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,920
represented by the identity matrix where

433
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,240
the top right entry is replaced by a

434
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,560
the sum of two elements can be computed

435
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,240
by multiplying the representing matrices

436
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,959
and multiplication is also possible

437
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,160
using some specific public matrices j1

438
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,040
up to j5

439
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,399
since the formulas representing

440
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,680
over r the generation of sextuples

441
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,199
have fixed size

442
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,279
and since we have reduced this to a

443
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,440
problem of secure computation over

444
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,959
non-abelian groups

445
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,520
using the work by benora and cliff

446
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,599
we can apply existing npc protocols in

447
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,039
this setting

448
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,359
the work by calling it all is a solution

449
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,240
here

450
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,319
but unfortunately their efficiency is

451
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,160
merely polynomial in the number of

452
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,119
parties

453
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,199
let's now turn to our more efficient

454
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,520
non-black box pre-processing for the

455
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,760
ring of m times n matrices over the

456
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,400
integers modulo 2 to the k

457
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
remember that here we have secret

458
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,080
sharing schemes which are not

459
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,440
multiplicative

460
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,160
and they are either left or right

461
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,679
modules

462
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,840
as long as the matrix size is

463
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,360
logarithmic in the number of parties

464
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,960
we need to produce

465
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,240
sextuples as shown in the slide

466
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,799
which we will simplify in the three

467
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,799
following steps

468
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,160
first of all

469
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,400
assume that we can generate this even

470
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,600
bigger amount of correlated randomness

471
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,240
which lacks the straight bracket sharing

472
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,000
of a times b

473
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,280
and additionally shares entry by entry

474
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,440
these matrices a

475
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
b and s

476
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,840
which we denote with the double brackets

477
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,280
and the gr subscript

478
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,120
by leveraging the multiplicative

479
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,600
properties of shamir's scheme

480
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,120
over the color ring

481
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,679
we can compute the value a times b plus

482
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,480
s

483
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,520
reconstruct it and using the straight

484
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,320
bracket sharing of s we cover a straight

485
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,480
bracket sharing of a times b

486
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,320
this is a simplification of what we

487
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,520
actually do

488
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,080
since we encode matrix entries into

489
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,880
gallery elements more efficiently using

490
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,760
a previous work

491
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,679
from asiacrypt last year

492
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,600
but let's stick with this

493
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,160
in order to generate the correlated

494
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,480
values from step one

495
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,960
we use hyperinvertible matrices which

496
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,640
are extremely powerful when the

497
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,360
correlations that we want to produce are

498
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,919
linearly correlated

499
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,480
the important question here is over

500
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,240
which structure are these values

501
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,840
linearly correlated

502
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,640
in this case that's the integers modulo

503
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,559
2 to the k

504
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,880
so we can look at

505
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,280
the secret sharing with the straight

506
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,080
brackets angle brackets or double

507
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,360
brackets

508
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,120
as set 2k modules

509
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,720
the problem is that we do not have

510
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,360
hyperinvertible matrices in this ring

511
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,760
so we have to move to an extension

512
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,679
in order to find them

513
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,480
and this was a similar issue in

514
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,880
in the previous works

515
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,919
so

516
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:48,720
what

517
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,360
we will do reasoning about tensor

518
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,960

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,000
is

520
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
producing

521
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,120
finally these values

522
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,080
from

523
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,159
for step one

524
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,360
and

525
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,960
this is a bit

526
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,799
too fast to grasp

527
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,720
and also leaving a lot of details aside

528
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,679
but

529
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,600
hopefully this gives you a general idea

530
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,640
of how this pre-processing works and you

531
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,760
can

532
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,919
check this more carefully in in our

533
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,320
paper

534
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,559
that's all for this talk i would like to

535
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,720
thank you for your attention

536
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,960
and invite you to check the full version

537
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,039
of our paper only print

538
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,480
as well as

539
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,720
a small thread on twitter

540
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,159
where i have added an additional slide

541
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,320
where i tell more details about

542
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,640
efficiency if you prefer to check that

543
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,280
rather than the print paper

544
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,639
thanks a lot and have a good day

545
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,720
you
