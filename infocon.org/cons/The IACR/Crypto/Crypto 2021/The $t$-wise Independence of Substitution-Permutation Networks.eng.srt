00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,600
welcome to my talk the t-wise

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,399
independence of substitution permutation

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,680
networks

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,000
i'm tirion this is a joint work with

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,360
stefano and vinod

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,679
a central problem in crypto is to

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,600
construct random looking hidden

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
permutations

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,800
tons of works are targeting this problem

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,480
among these works

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,560
there is a well-known but not so

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,039
well-defined gap between theory and

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,720
practice

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,238
the theory work

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,160
called this object a pseudo-random

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,600
permutation

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,920
and they focus on security based on

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,480
well-studied assumptions

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,079
the practice work

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,120
called this object a block cipher

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,079
they are okay with heuristical security

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,760
the first priority

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,239
is being super efficient

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,760
i'm not seeing the theory work don't

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,280
care about the efficiency of practical

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,800
work don't care about proof just as we

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,920
all know

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,239
this gap exists

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,920
and it seems very hard to bridge it

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,520
in the literature

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,400
we already have purple secure prp based

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,680
on one way function factoring or lattice

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,280
problems

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,799
unfortunately

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,119
none of them is fast enough to be

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,479
practical

37
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,080
in practice

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,479
people use much more efficient block

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,880
ciphers such as aes

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,320
of course

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,520
everyone

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,079
everyone wants to understand whether eos

43
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,400
is secure

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,799
from the theory perspective

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,200
we want to base aes on hardness

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,280
assumptions

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,600
but we don't know how to do it

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,759
we don't even have a candidate

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,000
assumption

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,720
many theory work then try to ask the

51
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,320
security of es or similar ciphers in

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,119
some idealized models

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,799
but still

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,200
this work are not analyzing the actual

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,840
block ciphers

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,920
when we could start proving security

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,479
against arbitrary attacks

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,680
the next best thing we can hope for

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,959
is to identify classes of attacks

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,520
and to prove they cannot succeed with

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,200
good probability

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,360
to show this in picture

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,680
the community has already identified

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,319
many classes of attacks

65
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,879
previous works shows aes

66
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,400
can resist

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
some certain classes of text to some

68
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,080
extent

69
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,680
in this paper

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,239
we promote the study of t-wise

71
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,840
independence

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,920
which is the desired property

73
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
of block ciphers

74
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,840
when t equals 2

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,959
it already implies resistance to several

76
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,200
normal attacks including linear and

77
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,519
differential attacks

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,840
larger t implies resistance to more

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,239
attacks

80
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,959
t-wise independence is a very natural

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,280
property

82
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,200
for any t inputs

83
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,080
the corresponding t outputs should be id

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,840
uniform

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,959
we'll use a relaxed form

86
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,120
the corresponding t outputs should be

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,360
epsilon close to uniform

88
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,159
in statistical distance

89
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,440
okay

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,360
for visibility

91
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,799
the key lines has to be at least t times

92
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,720
the author less

93
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,360
this requirement can be ensured

94
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,959
by the standard assumption of

95
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,720
independent run key

96
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,680
which is assumed in almost every work in

97
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,599
the field especially starting a yes

98
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,239
from the theory perspective

99
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,519
t vice independence means

100
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,640
security against unbounded adversary who

101
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,680
makes at most t-curse

102
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
notice that

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
linear and differential attacks relies

104
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,319
on correlation between two queries

105
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,200
so

106
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,159
in some sense this attacks

107
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,799
are captured by an adversary that makes

108
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,360
only two curse

109
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,720
similarly

110
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,200
degree two differential attacks

111
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,280
can be captured by an adversary that

112
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,560
makes only to the dequeries

113
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,399
therefore

114
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,960
t vice independence implies resistance

115
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,040
to all these attacks

116
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,840
and to any attacks

117
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,320
that relies on correlations among few

118
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,240
queries

119
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,759
quantitatively

120
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,320
we show a tight relation between

121
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,120
the closeness to towards independence

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,520
and the resistance to linear

123
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,160
and differentiates

124
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,199
now

125
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,520
i'm going to give a brief overview on

126
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,520
the cipher design kc and spn

127
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,840
and the concrete cipher aes

128
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,440
i guess they are familiar to most

129
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,840
audience

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,120
to encrypt an input using kc

131
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,080
first

132
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,360
xor it with a round key

133
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,919
then applies a fixed and public

134
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,080
permutation

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,960
repeat this process this is called

136
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,919
around the repeat around many times

137
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,880
to get the output

138
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,680
spn it's a special case of kc

139
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,479
it also tells you how to construct this

140
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,639
fixed permutation

141
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,199
first divide the input into

142
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,680
a few small blocks

143
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,360
apply a small partition called xbox

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,600
to every block

145
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,479
then

146
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,000
mix the output using linear function

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,240
both operation is very efficient

148
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,800
the xbox can be complicated but it's

149
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
only over a small domain

150
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,320
the linear function is over a large

151
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,680
domain but it's very simple

152
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,440
then yes

153
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,720
aes is a special case of spn

154
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,840
the block

155
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,240
is eight bit long and

156
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,680
the s box is the inverse function

157
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,000
here i ignore some techno details that

158
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,840
are not important for understanding

159
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,400
so

160
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,440
r wrong the kc

161
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,240
has r plus one round keys actually this

162
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,440
is also true for spn or a s

163
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,360
and therefore

164
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,919
it cannot be r plus two y is independent

165
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,960
due to length of randomness

166
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,759
our positive result almost matched this

167
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,759
up this bound

168
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,360
we show that

169
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,120
our round kc

170
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,720
is close to

171
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,199
slightly smaller than our wires

172
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,199
independent

173
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,520
this is an extension result and is

174
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,880
proved by probabilistic method

175
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,680
i would like to emphasize here that

176
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,000
the difference between our result and

177
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,960
the ideal model results

178
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,440
in ideal mode results

179
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,080
pi is typically modeled as random

180
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,759
permutations

181
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,759
to which the first three only have

182
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,919
oracles

183
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,680
well in our result

184
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,599
pi is public

185
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,080
and it's completely known to diversity

186
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,840
okay this is our result for kc

187
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,680
for spl

188
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,080
say there are k blocks each

189
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,560
has a b bits

190
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,599
we consider the xbox being inverse which

191
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,560
is used

192
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,639
by a yes

193
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,000
or cube

194
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,039
which is used by mimik

195
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,280
for these text boxes

196
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,160
we show two round spn is close to twice

197
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,039
independence and three runs spn is even

198
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,479
closer to towards dependence

199
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,400
we also show sixth round es the x-rays

200
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,720
at s-round there's no

201
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,960
idealization at all

202
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,400
it's point four seven two close to twice

203
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,039
independence

204
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,560
compared with previous work

205
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,360
at the state of art pssl

206
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,520
shows four on the es it's pointless

207
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,240
close to twice independence

208
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,039
our results don't implies pssl because

209
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,639
they are considering a stronger notion

210
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,240
of closeness

211
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,199
and pssl don't impress our result

212
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,639
because our bound is much tighter

213
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,120
because our bond is tight enough in

214
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,240
particular

215
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,880
because it's smaller than half

216
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,679
and it can be amplified

217
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,000
increasing the number of runs

218
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,600
a s will be exponentially close to twice

219
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,440
independent

220
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,040
okay

221
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,320
so these are

222
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,560
these are our results

223
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,880
in the rest of talk

224
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,959
i'm too i'm going to give a technical

225
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,320
overview

226
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,360
on our proof

227
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,160
for kc

228
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,440
we show r round k c is close to slightly

229
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,760
less than rbs independence

230
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,519
we prove it by induction

231
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,760
say we have something that has t wise

232
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,839
independent

233
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,120
what if

234
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,200
we compose it

235
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,480
with one round of casing

236
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,040
the composition will be

237
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,040
close to t plus one wise impedance

238
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,720
we call this

239
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,200
independence amplification number

240
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,839
and we prove this using probabilities

241
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,320
a probabilistic argument

242
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
okay

243
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,080
here we saw the notion pointwise

244
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,320
closeness again

245
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,080
it means the two of the t outputs should

246
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,279
be close to uniform not only in l1

247
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,040
distance but also in l infinity distance

248
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,720
that is

249
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,040
their probability mass

250
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,120
their probability mass function should

251
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,880
be close to uniform on every point

252
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,680
because this notion is stronger

253
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,160
it's meaningful even if epsilon is much

254
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
larger than one which is the case we

255
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,640
consider

256
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,519
in our extraction level

257
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,680
the condition f being t vice

258
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,040
independence

259
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
can be relaxed

260
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,880
to have been close to device

261
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,279
independence

262
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,200
the resulting distance will increase

263
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,839
proportionally

264
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,920
the independence amplification limit

265
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,640
already implies something interesting

266
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,440
okay

267
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,160
zero around kc which is

268
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,079
one time pad

269
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,440
it's

270
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,480
one of my synthetics

271
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,560
then by repeatedly

272
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,800
applying independence

273
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,320
in dependency amplification

274
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,360
r1kc is somewhat close to r plus one was

275
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
independence

276
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,120
the distance is huge

277
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
but this this is already

278
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,480
a non-trivial result

279
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,959
this can be complemented

280
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,560
by another lemma we call it the distance

281
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,959
amplification level

282
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,519
which is also proved by probabilistic

283
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,279
method

284
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,079
see

285
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,040
f is very close to t vice dependence and

286
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,279
it's some c somewhat close

287
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,000
to t plus one by simplest

288
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,560
then adding one more run will make it

289
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,359
very close to t plus one by c impedance

290
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,040
okay

291
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,600
now we are ready to prove our kc result

292
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,320
it's a two dimension induction of

293
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,040
shorthand table

294
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,639
the base case

295
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,519
is one wise independence

296
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,839
any round of cases one less independence

297
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,760
applying the independence c independence

298
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,600
amplification lemma

299
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,120
r on k c is somewhat close to

300
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,480
r plus one y is independence

301
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,519
then

302
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,480
applies the distance amplification lemma

303
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,959
by adding a few more rounds

304
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,880
somewhat closeness

305
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,920
will become very close

306
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,800
this concludes the proof

307
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,440
next

308
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,519
i'm going to show how

309
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,639
spn

310
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,880
and as are close to 2 yc dependents

311
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,200
because this involves only two inputs

312
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,000
a nice observation is that

313
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,120
only the difference matters here

314
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,959
what does it mean

315
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,839
let me open the spn4 bit

316
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,200
fit two inputs into spn

317
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,760
after exoring the first round key

318
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,240
the only remaining information is their

319
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,240
difference right

320
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,519
okay similarly for output

321
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,680
we care about the distribution of the

322
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,839
two outputs

323
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
the joint distribution of the two output

324
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,360
it's close to uniform if and only if

325
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,320
this

326
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,360
difference is close to uniform okay

327
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,040
so we only need to care about difference

328
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,040
in spn

329
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
xbox is the only

330
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,800
non-linear operation we need to

331
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,240
understand how it maps input difference

332
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,360
to output difference formally speaking

333
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,399
given two inputs of different data

334
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,079
what is the diff what is the

335
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,160
distribution of the output difference

336
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,320
we started the case when the xbox is

337
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
inverse r cube

338
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,800
for these s boxes

339
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,959
the output difference

340
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,600
it's a random vector orthogonal to the

341
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,279
input difference

342
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,959
so in the picture

343
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,920
we can replace the xbox with processed

344
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,000
samples from other subsidies

345
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,560
this might sound too good to be true and

346
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,480
it's actually not exactly true

347
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,600
okay but but almost

348
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,440
one exception

349
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,199
is when data equals zero

350
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,680
when input difference says zero means

351
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,320
the inputs are the same

352
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,639
in such case the outputs must also must

353
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,920
also be the same okay

354
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,240
i also ignore some other technical

355
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,279
details in the picture

356
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,680
uh these details

357
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,040
are not important in the in the photo

358
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,079
proof you can find them in the paper but

359
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,120
please

360
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,519
ignore them for now

361
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,959
okay

362
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,839
say we feed the non-zero input

363
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,120
difference

364
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,399
to subspace sampling process

365
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,000
then the output

366
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,279
must has high mean entropy

367
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,240
the output difference will affect the

368
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,199
next round's input difference okay

369
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,959
so what if

370
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,959
the input difference has high entropy we

371
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,680
are in the next round now

372
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,560
as we proved in what we called

373
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,040
extraction lemma

374
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,240
in such case the output difference is

375
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,720
close to uniform

376
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,279
we prove it by fair analysis and we

377
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,240
later find the alternative proof using

378
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,279
elementary method

379
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,920
so this can be generalized

380
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,360
to consider multiple blocks together

381
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,320
as long as each input block

382
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,959
has higher entropy

383
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,880
the joint distribution

384
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,560
of the output block

385
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,440
is close to uniform

386
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,720
okay

387
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,639
so the most important bits here

388
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,440
uh

389
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,759
is that the input difference don't have

390
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,519
to be independent

391
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,279
they can have archery correlations they

392
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,240
can for example they can be oracle

393
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,320
the only required maximum distribution

394
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,360
to have high entropy

395
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,720
so we also have a stronger extraction

396
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,320
level

397
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,600
says

398
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,199
if every subset of input blocks has high

399
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,639
mean entropy

400
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,680
again

401
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,120
they can have

402
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,120
any correlation as long as

403
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,600
any subset of input block has high

404
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,800
entropy

405
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,759
the output will be very close to uniform

406
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,639
okay so quantitatively this improved by

407
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,959
a factor of but it

408
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,040
is improved exponentially in k

409
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,600
now we are ready to show the domain

410
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,279
result

411
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,680
so here is a spn

412
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,519
as we just discussed

413
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,000
all the xboxes can be replaced by

414
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,560
subspace sampling

415
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,040
the input difference is non-zero

416
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,480
somewhere

417
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
the subspace sampling

418
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,679
gives you high entropy

419
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,799
the linear function will propagate the

420
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,280
entropy to all blocks

421
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,679
here star means

422
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,880
the linear function has to uh

423
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,240
specify a a property that is

424
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,959
all of its coefficients are nonzero in

425
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,199
particular this is not satisfied by a s

426
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,559
but

427
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,559
let's say the entropy is propagated to

428
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,799
all blocks

429
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,160
then we can apply extraction lemma

430
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,200
as the condition is satisfied remember

431
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,080
the only thing we need is that each

432
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,000
input block individually has high

433
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,200
entropy

434
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,160
okay

435
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,520
therefore two runs a spn is close to

436
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,400
twice independent

437
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,240
to show a tighter bound let's retrieve

438
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,559
one step

439
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,440
the delta two column or has high mean

440
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,039
entropy

441
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,919
which means with high-probability

442
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,200
they are all non-zero

443
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,360
then subspace sampling gives you high

444
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,960
entropy

445
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,480
independently on each block

446
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,840
you can think that the delta two called

447
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,120
the delta two prime column to be all

448
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,480
independent

449
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,799
this is not exactly true but

450
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,720
can be formalized

451
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,080
okay

452
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,480
then after the last mix last linear

453
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,240
mixing

454
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,200
it's not hard to show that every subset

455
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,080
of the delta 3 column

456
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,720
has high entropy

457
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,360
here we only require the linear function

458
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,799
to be invertible

459
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,120
now the condition of strong extraction

460
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,080
that might satisfy again

461
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,320
this is all we need every subset has

462
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,600
high entropy there can be any

463
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,919
correlation

464
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,120
therefore we show three round spn it's

465
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,639
very close to two voice independence

466
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,440
similarly

467
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,000
by making our hands dirty

468
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,520
we can prove six-strong aes is close to

469
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
two-wise independence

470
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,760
remember we also have the almost tight

471
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,640
result for kc

472
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,919
here are all

473
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,960
we prove

474
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,840
okay

475
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,919
let me finish the talk with the summary

476
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,400
slides

477
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,360
the t-wise independence

478
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,679
has a really rich body of problems we

479
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,960
find there and we only touch the surface

480
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,480
for example

481
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,039
uh independence amplification

482
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,640
is something we don't find in place work

483
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,080
can you show

484
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,760
three wise independence of some existing

485
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,559
concrete cipher

486
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,760
of course

487
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,480
our result is substantial also you

488
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,400
probably need some brand new technique

489
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,559
key scheduling

490
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,600
we

491
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,760
and almost every working field assume

492
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,320
independent run keys

493
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,480
that is also the only idealization we

494
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,799
use

495
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,039
is it possible to say something

496
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,559
meaningful

497
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,120
while taking the key scheduling into

498
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,480
account

499
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,720
okay

500
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,320
uh

501
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,559
the relationship between twice

502
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,559
independence and other

503
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,960
attacks

504
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:41,679
t

505
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,480
t wise impedance mind implies recencies

506
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,880
to more attacks

507
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,039
on the other hand

508
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,080
when you're looking for attacks on es

509
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,159
you should probably avoid those attacks

510
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,799
that relies on correlation

511
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,360
based on fuel cell tax because we know

512
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,120
es is to some extent uh two s different

513
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,640
two wise independent okay

514
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,039
and finally can you analyze other

515
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,520
concrete cipher design for example there

516
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,400
are

517
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,760
uh

518
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,760
uh for example like arx

519
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,640
and

520
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,039
that's all i want to share today thank

521
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,440
you for listening
