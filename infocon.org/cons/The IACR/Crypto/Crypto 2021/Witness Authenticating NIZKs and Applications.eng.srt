00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,520
hi everyone i'm going to introduce our

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,080
work entitled witness authentication

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,920
nisk and applications i'm heaven this is

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,000
a joint work with chiang kang

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,079
i'll begin with background and our

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,760
motivations

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,160
to say this let's take a quick look at

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,240
elon musk's authentication which is a

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,199
major class of these applications

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,240
in general it allows user alice to sign

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,400
a message on behalf of a

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,640
group and the very fire will be

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,040
convinced this message was signed by

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,960
someone in this group

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,040
but he cannot figure out who signed it

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,280
the law of mercy is usually formalized

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
via indistinguishability but in

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,440
literature a lot of mercy indeed have

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,000
many variants according to adversary's

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,039
knowledge

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,440
the simplest case consider outsider

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,039
non-mercy it considers an adversary that

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,920
does not have any unnecessary over group

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,760
members

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,840
a stronger form is sometimes called

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,479
selfless law emerging which which

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,760
enables

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,799
the adversary to have all secrecy except

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,119
the victims secretly

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,759
and finally the full mercy which

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,799
considers the strongest adversaries that

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,040
could really have all secret gifts

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,280
including alice secretary and bob's

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,759
secretary

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,240
on the other hand the autonomous signing

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,560
functionality is insufficient in many

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,200
scenarios it's necessary to provide

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,759
other desirable functionalities as well

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,000
to make them easy to use

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,720
for example the user may wish to detect

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,680
a case closure claim her authorship of a

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
previously signed document

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,640
or clear herself from accusation when

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,280
some bad guy some signed something

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,720
illegal on a group on behalf of a group

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,719
containing her

47
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,960
in more concrete examples

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,680
for example the epid signature provided

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,439
by inters sjx is designed to support

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,959
revoking users and to the rimfire site

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,280
and many other features

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,040
and similarly

53
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,080
uh

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,440
laurently blacklisting embodied users

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,560
without trusted trusted third party is

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,280
also in needed

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,360
there are more examples to list

58
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,599
and all of them have to lead to a

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,599
trade-off of lolita merch

60
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,920
to ex to explain this in more detail we

61
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,160
notice that all about functionalities i

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,480
uses are essentially built upon a very

63
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,360
simple identification function namely

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,599
given the secret key it allows

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,560
identifying whether of a autonomous

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,959
signature was created using this

67
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,720
security

68
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,200
it's easy to say that when anniversary

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,879
has the secret key

70
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,599
has a secret case of both alice and ball

71
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,319
she can run this identification locally

72
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,080
and decide the real signer therefore

73
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,239
foreign is out of reach

74
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,440
and since the selfless alarming does not

75
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,840
give the victims secret key to the

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,040
adversary

77
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,680
the bursaries just cannot leverage this

78
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
uh identification

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,000
self allowability is the best possible

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,239
privacy definition

81
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,640
that is compatible with identification

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,040
besides those alarms authentication

83
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,720
schemes mentioned before

84
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
the privacy with identification style

85
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,400
primitives appear in many other topics

86
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,799
in privacy parts

87
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,159
it is used to establish a

88
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,360
cover channel between cdm parameters to

89
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
identify invalid users

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,920
in encryptions

91
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,080
the identification functionality is

92
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,560
essential to enable searching encrypted

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,360
data using plain text which is crucial

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,400
for fast searching

95
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,920
moreover if a commitment supports

96
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,319
identification opening can be done by

97
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,879
just presenting committed committed

98
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,040
messages only

99
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,920
such commitment is even used for

100
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,720
for instance 18 gram oracles in some

101
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,639
settings

102
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,040
from a take away point of view

103
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,080
these primitives are popular because the

104
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,639
compatible privacy is philosophically

105
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,840
meaningful

106
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,240
it's protecting a cigarette against

107
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,280
those who don't know it

108
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,240
however although these primitives are

109
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,080
conceptually close

110
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,280
they were independently studied in

111
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,479
many similarly unrelated domains and

112
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,479
lacked a unified view

113
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,720
and each has to be established from

114
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,919
scratch and some of them indeed face

115
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,040
physics

116
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,650
difficulties in designing

117
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,320
[Music]

118
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,240
this is not the case for achieving

119
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,600
privacy alone

120
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,680
we have a fundamental primitive

121
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,400
non-interactive zero knowledge

122
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,360
which is considered to be a source of

123
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,479
privacy

124
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,280
this is a core of many

125
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,000
polymers authentication schemes it can

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,880
also be applied to enhance the security

127
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,520
of many other fundamental primitives

128
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,400
like encryption and commitments the

129
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,120
elegant the elegant

130
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,880
formulation of nisk enables easy design

131
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,240
and analysis of its applications

132
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,039
so

133
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,960
when these alarms authentications

134
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,680
encryptions and commitments need to be

135
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
augmented with the identification

136
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,039
functionality it's nature to ask

137
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,160
can risk support identification and be

138
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,120
the source of identification such that

139
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,240
we can design and and analysis other

140
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,560
primitives in ma in much simpler manner

141
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,440
in this work we initiate the study of

142
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,039
nics with identification functionality

143
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,160
first we formalize it as a new primitive

144
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,720
since we define the sunnis of definition

145
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,280
identification which makes it

146
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,440
look like a message authentication

147
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,240
scheme that uses this witness as its

148
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,400
secret key we term it by witness

149
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,880
authentication nisk

150
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,440
we then give three modular constructions

151
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,680
from basic primitives

152
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,319
and finally we show the surprising power

153
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,199
of this new primitive we show how to use

154
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,319
this pre primitive to cons to give a

155
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,160
very simple construction of group

156
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,639
signature supporting verb fire local

157
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,280
revocation and we construct we use it to

158
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
construct plane test checkable

159
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,319
encryption

160
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,560
and more interestingly

161
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,360
we show how to how this primitive can

162
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,039
give can advance

163
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:53,919
the

164
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,960
the the existing numerable hash

165
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,560
constructions

166
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,039
which we are presented to in session in

167
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,120
slash eight random world course in some

168
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,599
settings

169
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,080
okay now let's model this new new

170
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,599
primitive

171
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,120
instantaneous

172
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,919
assume a common common reference string

173
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,039
approver with a witness can can create a

174
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,440
single string quarter proof to convince

175
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,960
the verifier the statement is true

176
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,880
the identification functionality we

177
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,680
consider is to enable identifying

178
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,919
whether a proof is generated using a

179
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,599
specific witness

180
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,000
and the straightforward formulation is

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,319
to take both proof and weakness as

182
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,759
inputs

183
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,280
however in many applications the witness

184
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,720
is structured it consists secret and ram

185
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,759
coins

186
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,639
and the user is only supposed to have

187
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,680
the secret and does not have the whole

188
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
witness

189
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,400
to make the identification more useful

190
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,960
we abstract the notion of identify

191
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,840
witness which is a part of witness and

192
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,919
the proof can be identified as being

193
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,479
generated from witness that has this

194
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,720
identifier

195
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,360
as a foreigner here is incompatible with

196
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,479
standards with identification strategic

197
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,000
standard zero knowledge is also

198
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,400
incompatible with uh with

199
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,639
this identification

200
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,840
to say this

201
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,080
in this definition

202
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,599
the diversity

203
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,720
could receive proofs or re were

204
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,960
simulated proofs that were generated

205
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,640
without using

206
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,279
any witness and the statement and the

207
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,399
witness and witness is is chosen by the

208
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,519
prover after seeing the crs so

209
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,320
the identification is will be loaned to

210
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,160
the adversary

211
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,959
if there is uh there if there is an

212
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,519
identification functionality the

213
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,360
adversary can leverage this function to

214
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,920
distinguish the real proofs and the

215
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,240
simulated proofs so the standard zero

216
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,399
knowledge is is uh out of reach

217
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
we have to rule out the case then

218
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,360
anniversary knows the identifier so the

219
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,480
only possible definition is to defend of

220
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,600
adversaries without without knowing the

221
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,680
attention however

222
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,600
it's very tricky to model without

223
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,320
knowing things in the context of nisk

224
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,560
first as we consider language from

225
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,040
anniversaries they may already encoding

226
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,640
archery prior

227
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
priority knowledge in their advising

228
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,440
strings and we cannot we cannot decide

229
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,320
whether this advice ring has encoded

230
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,640
some item first

231
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,920
secondly send information about

232
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,640
identifiers is always available to

233
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,279
adversaries at least the statement

234
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,399
itself can be considered as a set

235
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,200
information about the identity

236
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,480
and finally and most importantly

237
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
these usually consider adaptive

238
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,040
adversaries which could choose statement

239
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,079
and weakness after seeing cis

240
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,880
if we don't take adaptive adaptiveness

241
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,040
into consideration the result primitive

242
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,200
may not be as useful as standard risks

243
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,279
we address above challenges by

244
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,519
introducing unpretty unpredictable

245
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,680
samples into xero knowledge definition

246
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,399
framework some predictable sampler is a

247
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,200
randomized algorithm outputting a

248
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,320
statement

249
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,720
an identifier part of weakness and it's

250
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,120
a long identical part

251
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,240
since the statement is always available

252
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,959
to adversaries we require that the

253
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,839
probability of finding the identifier

254
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,320
given the statement is very small we can

255
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,079
measure the unpredictability using

256
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,839
unpredictability injury

257
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,240
then the bursary can

258
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,519
issue can queries approval oracle using

259
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,560
a sampler instead of concrete statement

260
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,519
and witness and this is the approval

261
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,040
oracle will

262
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,600
sample statement and witness using this

263
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,920
sampler and generate real proofs or

264
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,600
simulation proofs according to the

265
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,680
sample result

266
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,560
note that the bursary can affect the

267
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,720
scepter after saying the crs and

268
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,839
she can

269
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,399
and she can know absolute knowledge

270
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,000
about the sampler as long as the final

271
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,680
uh identifier is unknown is uh still

272
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,440
unpredictable to her

273
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,800
so this formulation is compatible with

274
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,040
identification functionality

275
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,000
and

276
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,399
it preserves the

277
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,640
the adaptive adaptivities as much as

278
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,040
possible

279
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,959
there are other subjects to be addressed

280
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,800
the first question is how to model

281
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,079
proofs from same or release segments

282
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,440
this crashing

283
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,079
is due to then now adversary can only

284
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,079
issue samplers that i won't give the

285
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,680
same statements in different invocations

286
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,480
our solution is first requires leave for

287
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,040
pro work approval oracle which is which

288
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,440
stores previously sample result and

289
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,079
allow adversary to query with another

290
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,399
extended sampler which can send the

291
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,720
previous samples previous samples into

292
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,639
same or related ones

293
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,240
the second question is more subtle

294
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,120
that is some samplers are not i'm pretty

295
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,720
um unpredictable alone but unpredictable

296
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,519
with respect to an external trust

297
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,519
parameter generation procedure

298
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,880
this is due to

299
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,839
risks is usually used and used as a

300
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,560
building block in larger crypto system

301
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,760
systems

302
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,560
and

303
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,800
when we consider an average case

304
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,200
definition average case definition we

305
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,360
have to take external procedures into

306
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,480
consideration

307
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,120
so introduce trust so we introduce trust

308
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,760
parameters generation procedures to

309
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,320
model this and allow this

310
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,560
and allow this kind of

311
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
samples

312
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,720
putting all these uh

313
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,600
discussions into our

314
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,399
together we can give the final

315
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,560
definition for entropical zero

316
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,639
knowledges

317
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,519
to become partial with identification we

318
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,920
have defined in tropical zero knowledge

319
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,240
and for active identity identification

320
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,639
itself we also need to argument

321
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,680
sunglasses

322
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,800
to define the proper to define the

323
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,079
identity

324
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,399
to define the functionality in prints of

325
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,240
malicious users

326
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,160
the first intuition we seek to capture

327
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,839
is that no one can avoid being

328
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,560
identified that's his ability proof must

329
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,680
be identified by an identifier which

330
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,720
means loan to the approval

331
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,440
we model this by augmenting knowledge

332
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,519
assignments and requires the extractor

333
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,360
to extract a

334
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,839
witness and the identifications from a

335
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,240
body proof and the proof shall be

336
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,639
identified by the identifier

337
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,000
therefore

338
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,560
authentication notion is clear clearly

339
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,160
subsumes standard knowledge soundness

340
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,560
next what we want to capture then no one

341
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,079
can frame others

342
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,240
it's a message authentication like

343
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,519
definition

344
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,680
the adversity's goal is to force your

345
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,399
proof being as in fact identified by an

346
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,959
unknown witness if even after seeing

347
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,920
many proofs from those witness this is

348
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,240
why we call this primitive also witness

349
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,320
authentication knowledge

350
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,399
discuss

351
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,240
the last the last

352
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,519
sunday's definition is identify unix

353
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,240
the capture the invisibility of finding

354
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,720
one proof identified by two distinct

355
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,680
identifiers this definition is useful

356
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,920
when the rosary tries to

357
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,399
generate a volume proof being said being

358
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,360
identified by a string which is not even

359
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,160
which is even not a with his identifier

360
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,399
and we note uh

361
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,480
all these uh

362
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
for single applications

363
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
uh it may not lead to all these things

364
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
definitions but uh

365
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,440
we provide them to enable various

366
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,839
applications

367
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
we have formulas we have formalized this

368
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,279
new notion

369
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,680
now let's construct it

370
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,959
the overall idea is to add

371
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,839
identifiable tag to needs proof the next

372
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,759
proof shows the truthfulness of the

373
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,519
treatment and the attack is honestly

374
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,639
generated

375
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,600
for achieving properties of the witness

376
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,160
authenticating risk the tag should

377
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,959
should should satisfy money similarly

378
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,480
come

379
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,399
conflict properties

380
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,440
first it should be identifiable and it

381
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,360
also should be unforgivable and

382
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,000
dismissable even the input is just i'm

383
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,839
pretty

384
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,320
unpredictable and if we need if we knew

385
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,279
the identity for unice this tag should

386
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,360
also be as unique

387
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,079
that is it cannot be identified with

388
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,839
respect to distinct distinct

389
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,639
input after all this all preservation we

390
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,720
find the remarkables match all this

391
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,240
requirement

392
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,480
but unfortunately we don't know how to

393
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
prove in their knowledge then a

394
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,399
remarkable based attack is honestly

395
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,240
generated so we have to find other risks

396
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,639
we start with a simple case whether

397
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,199
where the identifier is solution is a

398
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,519
pseudo-random condition on all public

399
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,199
information

400
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,680
we know it's possible in autonomous

401
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,079
authentication and in this case we can

402
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,519
simply use a pseudo-run

403
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,959
function

404
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,720
and all properties can be easily

405
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,880
verified

406
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,639
for general case then then the

407
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,320
identifier is non-uniform condition

408
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,160
um or public information

409
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,639
we cannot directly use the identifier as

410
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,920
a pfk

411
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,120
a simple solution is using random is

412
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,839
using ram restructure to convert the

413
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,039
identifier into a prk

414
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,039
let's examine the properties so

415
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,839
identifiability can and the uniqueness

416
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,199
can be

417
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,720
can be easily satisfied from underlying

418
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,000
properties

419
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,640
but simulatability and unforgivability

420
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,839
which originally depend on solutions now

421
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,039
have to require the extractor to output

422
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,240
solutions to a pseudogym string to be

423
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,160
observed key

424
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,880
this requirement seems very trivial and

425
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,919
first like balance due from the property

426
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,080
of romney's release tracker but but

427
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,440
it's not in this case first as we

428
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,640
consider

429
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,440
as we allow bursaries to have multiple

430
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,080
proofs from the same identifier

431
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,440
we have to require the extractor and if

432
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,280
we put the seed into

433
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,160
as if we put this put the seed as a part

434
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,960
of the text we have to require the

435
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,400
extractor to

436
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,480
uh be reusable that is produced suitable

437
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,960
with many differences

438
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,679
however reusability is a very long

439
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,320
trivial property of ram of a randomness

440
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,679
extractor

441
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,559
and

442
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,960
the unforgivability considers malicious

443
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,000
users

444
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,559
it may not choose a seed from uniform

445
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,120
distribution so the output of

446
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,280
the extractor cannot be guaranteed to be

447
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,600
guaranteed to be solution pseudo-random

448
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,480
but unfortunately as we are in the cis

449
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,760
model we can leverage the crs as i said

450
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,799
we'll put the c put the state into cis

451
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,240
so we can use the same system for or for

452
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,480
all texts and as you see the must be

453
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
good for sure

454
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,160
and we can and then we can give us a

455
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,559
secure tag generation

456
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,799
but however

457
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,360
the extractor needs seeds independent of

458
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,559
a source

459
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,840
putting said into cis will only work for

460
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,960
cis independent samplers

461
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,039
our goal is to have a full-fledged

462
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,400
construction for crs dependent samplers

463
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,320
let's recheck the challenges

464
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,360
for reusability known constructions

465
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,160
require real real entropy instead of

466
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,360
instead of

467
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,360
of

468
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,240
unpredictability

469
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,480
to against batteries

470
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,880
we we don't even know how to define

471
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,360
which city is bad which city is good

472
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,440
this difficulty this difficulties

473
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,799
arising due to we use due to we use ram

474
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,840
extractors to extract pfk

475
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,720
and

476
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,640
they may be solved

477
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,799
they might be solved

478
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,760
if there is a strong variant of a

479
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
randomized extractor but however we

480
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,080
don't know how to achieve it yet

481
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,960
but from a take away point of review we

482
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,679
find we only need simulatability instead

483
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,400
of pseudo-damage we don't really need to

484
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,919
insist on using a prf

485
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,559
we notice encryption is another source

486
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,039
of simulatability and deterministical

487
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,520
public in public encryption allows to

488
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,400
identify we can use a dpke to construct

489
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,240
the tag

490
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,280
and identify that identified variability

491
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,039
is easy to follow

492
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,960
regarding simulatability we can use

493
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,280
multi-user secure dpke such and we can

494
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,000
have the submittability across many

495
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,880
different public keys

496
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,440
but uniquely and unfeasibility will

497
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,919
require the good news of public key then

498
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,240
his encryption algorithm with this

499
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,880
public case should be an injection but

500
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,200
public publicly is chosen by proverbs it

501
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,080
left a question how to deal with how to

502
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,600
deal with malicious pk

503
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,760
a solution a solution is put into cis

504
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,400
uh put put the push puts public key into

505
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,840
the crs but it has to require the csv

506
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,720
independent samplers again

507
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,960
our observation is and the goodness of

508
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
public key the algebraic

509
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,120
and we can enforce the goodness by

510
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,919
cryptography instead of modelling more

511
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,600
pricing we can ask these proofs we can

512
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,400
ask this proof showing the goodness of

513
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,480
the pk

514
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,720
and putting all together we're putting a

515
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,440
full-fledged construction

516
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
with remark our construction can be

517
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,679
based on standard submissions including

518
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,320
delinear assumptions

519
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,880
finally we show how to use our new tools

520
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,039
amongst the state of arts or of

521
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,200
applications

522
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,280
we should concrete examples of long

523
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,559
marble hash it's a triplet the hashi the

524
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,640
caging algorithm outputs a public

525
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,760
hashtag the evaluation algorithm maps an

526
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,000
input to a hash value and the

527
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,720
verification checks whether the hash

528
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,159
value is from a specific input

529
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,880
allah should satisfy collision

530
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,120
resistance perfect about

531
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,600
one weakness and number malleability the

532
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,720
number ability the malleability requires

533
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,000
one cannot have

534
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,799
more

535
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,360
uh hash value into a really related

536
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,280
husband

537
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,000
the

538
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,480
melbourne hash is proposed to in slash

539
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
80 gram work but prior work

540
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,559
if the auxiliary information

541
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,039
is linked to the anniversary

542
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,679
it had to use either

543
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,240
long standard assumptions were directly

544
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,360
using landmarks it left an interesting

545
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,480
question question can we have a

546
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,120
lamentable hash from standard standard

547
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,039
assumptions

548
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,640
we give a simple construction for

549
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,880
lamborgh using witnesses authentication

550
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,159
risk intuitively perfectly validness is

551
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,640
commitment with identification we can

552
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,120
add identification to commitment using

553
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,039
weakness or significant risk

554
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,559
and the lung malleable harsh

555
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,480
numberability follows our

556
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,640
unforgivability

557
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,440
we have these constructions and we just

558
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,760
use a witness authenticating the proof

559
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,320
to demonstrate the commitment is well

560
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,400
formed and stated the committee message

561
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,240
and identifier

562
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,919
to support the identification

563
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,840
functionality our construction can

564
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,960
surely be from standard options and from

565
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,520
and fro and for general and and that can

566
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,960
handle general auxiliary information

567
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,039
we can also use weakness of the nikken

568
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,200
disk to prove well-formedness of

569
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,640
publicly

570
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,799
set encryption separates and sets the

571
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,000
message and

572
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,440
as identifier as and obtain a plan test

573
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,600
check for encryption which is the first

574
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,440
standard model construction for long

575
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,400
uniform messages we can also use witness

576
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,440
authenticating proof to prove the

577
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,760
group membership and give a simple

578
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,600
construction of a

579
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,840
group signature with verifier local

580
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,679
revocation

581
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,679
our construction is the first sentence

582
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,640
by auxiliary input security that is the

583
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,440
security properties are preserved even

584
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,360
when the adversary have

585
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,200
arbitrary half invert auxiliary

586
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,360
information about security case which

587
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,919
which provides strong guarantee when the

588
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,559
case leak

589
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,919
to have concluding we care we carefully

590
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,720
integrate identification functionality

591
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,440
that has appeared in various primitives

592
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,919
in tunisk one of the most fundamental

593
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,039
primitives

594
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,440
we'll trace many subtle challenges

595
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,760
subtle challenges towards secure

596
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,000
constructions

597
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
as a result we can give simple

598
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,559
constructions to diverse applications

599
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,960
and advance the state of the art in all

600
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,039
these applications

601
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,360
we believe there are other features and

602
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,880
functionalities that implicitly exist in

603
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,760
similarly unrelated unrelated domains

604
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,559
and still lack a unified view

605
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,400
we left to to be explored how to study

606
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,039
them in fundamental primitives like

607
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,520
nisks

608
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,840
and the sex that's all
