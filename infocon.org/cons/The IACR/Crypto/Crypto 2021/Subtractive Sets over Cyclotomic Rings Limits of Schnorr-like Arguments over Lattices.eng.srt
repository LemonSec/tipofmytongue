00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,480
hello i'm russell line welcome to my

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,000
talk on subjective sets over

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,399
psychoatomic rings limits of snorlax

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,320
arguments over lattices

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,000
this is a joint work with martin

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,480
albrecht

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,519
this work is about the relationship

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,440
between the mathematical objects called

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,840
subjective sets and lattice-based

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,080
snorlax arguments

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,840
since you are watching this video you

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,240
are probably interested in lattice-based

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,480
snorlax arguments in general

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,320
therefore i recommend checking out these

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,760
concurrent works which are also

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,440
appearing in this year's crypto

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,600
let me begin with this slide that every

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,680
other lattice talk needs that is the

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,079
slide about the short integer solution

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,039
problem or the sis problem

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,600
the sis problem is parametrized by a

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,719
modulus q and a nonbound beta

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,800
and a problem instance is given by a

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,039
matrix a and a vector y

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,160
and it asks us to find a short vector x

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,280
so that a times x equals to y modulo q

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,479
and the norm of x is bounded by beta

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,200
usually the s i s problem is considered

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,680
over the integer ring that is the matrix

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,880
a the vector y and x are all vectors and

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,119
matrices over the ring of rational

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,400
integers

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,159
but in this work we are considering the

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,040
sis problem over general ring r that is

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,280
a mathematical object that allows you to

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
perform addition subtraction

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,520
multiplication but not always division

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,960
the motivating problem of this work is

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,280
that of proving the knowledge of an sis

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
witness x

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,840
to be more concrete let me introduce

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,040
this generalized sis relation which is

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,520
parametrized by a ring element s a

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,560
non-bound beta and also the modulus q

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,720
which is omitted

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,799
the relation takes as input statement

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,200
which is specified by a matrix a and a

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,079
vector y and also another vector a

49
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,119
witness vector x and checks if a times x

50
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,920
equals to s times y modulo q and the

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,119
norm of x is bounded by beta

52
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,399
notice that the

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,840
vector x doesn't necessarily satisfy a x

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,560
equals y exactly but instead there is an

55
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,879
element s called the slack here

56
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,520
if the slack s equals 1 then we say that

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,239
the witness x satisfies the statement a

58
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,879
y with no slack otherwise we say that

59
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,440
the vector x satisfies the statement a y

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,959
with slack s

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,959
generally speaking an argument system

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,440
for proving the si explanation involves

63
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,640
two entities the prover and the verifier

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,280
the prover inputs the sis relation a y

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,440
as well as the witness x while the

66
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,480
verifier only inputs the statement a y

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,640
the prover and the verifier may interact

68
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,879
for several rounds and eventually the

69
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,280
verifier will output a bit b which is

70
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,959
either zero or one

71
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,120
deciding whether or not it believes that

72
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,000
the proof of p knows of a witness x that

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,159
satisfies a y

74
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,879
an argument system could satisfy several

75
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,959
properties and in this work we are going

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,040
to focus on the completeness property

77
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,120
and the soundness property

78
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,040
we say that the argument system is

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,000
complete for the relation r1 beta if

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,239
whenever the witness x satisfies the

81
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,879
statement a y with no slack

82
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,040
then the prover is able to convince the

83
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,480
verifier to output 1.

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,519
on the other hand we say that the

85
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,920
argument system has copper knowledge

86
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,720
soundness for the relation r s beta

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,200
prime where kappa here is known as the

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,879
knowledge error

89
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,879
if there exists an efficient knowledge

90
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,400
extractor e

91
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,840
such that if the prover convinces we to

92
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,000
accept the statement a y with some

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,680
probability rho which is strictly

94
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,440
greater than kappa

95
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,760
then the extractor when given oracle

96
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,239
access to the prover should extract some

97
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,959
kind of weakness extilled that satisfies

98
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,680
the relation r as beta prime with

99
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,720
probability rho minus kappa

100
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
a recurring challenge when designing

101
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,840
argument systems for the sis relation is

102
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,480
to design the prover and the verifier

103
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
such that the knowledge area copper and

104
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,160
the slack s are both minimized

105
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,000
of course one would also like to

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,079
minimize the difference between beta

107
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,320
prime and beta which we call the stretch

108
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
in this work but i will not go into

109
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
detail in this talk

110
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
with this background let me overview the

111
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,720
existing argument systems for the sis

112
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,919
relation

113
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,479
prior to the year 2019 there were

114
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,720
basically three types of argument

115
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,360
systems for the sis relation

116
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,120
the first kind of systems are based on

117
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,600
pcp or probabilistically checkable

118
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,520
proofs which is a kind of information

119
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,400
theoretic proof systems

120
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,720
these constructions usually start from a

121
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,120
pcp for proving statements from a

122
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
certain mp complete language such as

123
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,639
r1cs

124
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,400
and compile it with a commitment scheme

125
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,560
into an argument system

126
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,320
these constructions typically achieve

127
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,160
logarithmic proof size

128
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,479
and can prove the s isolation without

129
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,240
any slack and stretch

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,560
however to achieve negligible knowledge

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
error a super polynomial size modular

132
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,440
skew is usually needed which impacts

133
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,840
efficiency

134
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,600
the second type of argument systems for

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,759
the sis relation are called stern-like

136
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,800
systems

137
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,039
these are combinatorial systems based on

138
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,680
the classic cut and choose technique

139
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,320
like the pcp based proof systems these

140
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,639
sternlike systems can prove the

141
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,639
s-isolation without any slack and

142
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,520
stretch

143
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,479
however due to the combinatorial nature

144
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,800
they often require linear size proofs

145
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
and can only achieve constant knowledge

146
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,680
error

147
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
which means that the argument needs to

148
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,000
be repeated lambda times where lambda is

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,320
the security parameter to achieve

150
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,840
negligible knowledge error

151
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,639
finally the third type of arguments are

152
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,120
snow-like arguments these are algebraic

153
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,120
arguments which can achieve inverse

154
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,600
polynomial knowledge error and therefore

155
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,400
only lambda over log lambda repetition

156
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
is needed to achieve negligible

157
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,240
knowledge error

158
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,400
a distinctive feature of the snorlax

159
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,880
systems is their linearity

160
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,039
which could be exploited for recursive

161
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,199
composition using a technique called

162
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,880
bulletproof folding

163
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,759
to achieve logarithmic size proofs

164
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,919
on the negative side snorlax systems

165
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,400
could only prove at the sis relation

166
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,560
with both slag and stretch

167
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,479
which is significant because these get

168
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,720
amplified when performing recursive

169
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,960
composition

170
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,160
after the year 2019 there was an effort

171
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,479
in combining the best of both the stern

172
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,440
and snow worlds by introducing extra

173
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
non-linear constraints to the snorlax

174
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,360
systems

175
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
like the snorlax systems these new

176
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,919
systems can achieve inverse polynomial

177
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,160
knowledge error and like the stern-like

178
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,479
systems they can prove the sis relation

179
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,120
without slack and stretch

180
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,199
however due to the extra non-linear

181
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,919
constraints these new systems are no

182
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,000
longer compatible with the bulletproof

183
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,319
folding technique and therefore it is

184
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,479
unclear how to produce

185
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,840
logarithmic size proofs from

186
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,680
them given this state of affair a

187
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,840
natural question is therefore can we

188
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,759
keep the linearity and inverse

189
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,840
polynomial knowledge error of snorlax

190
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,319
systems but at the same time reduce the

191
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,160
slack and stretch

192
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,080
to answer this question let us take a

193
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,319
closer look at some existing snorlax

194
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,319
systems

195
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,720
our first example is the lattice analog

196
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,520
of the textbook snore protocol for

197
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,000
proving discrete logarithm

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,319
in this protocol the prover first sample

199
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,319
a short vector u and compute the vector

200
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,440
v which is equal to a times u and sent v

201
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,000
over to the verifier

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,919
in turn the verifier would sample a

203
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,120
challenge c from the challenge set big c

204
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,879
and send c over to the prover

205
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,280
finally the prover computes the vector x

206
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,919
hat which is equal to u plus c times x

207
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,479
and verifier checks that x hat is indeed

208
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,120
computed correctly

209
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,639
a point to note from this simple

210
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,120
protocol is that the knowledge error

211
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,520
copper is inversely proportional to the

212
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
size of the challenge set

213
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,759
therefore to achieve inverse polynomial

214
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,680
knowledge error we would need to

215
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
instantiate this protocol with a

216
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,919
polynomial sized challenge set

217
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,160
next let us examine how a knowledge

218
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,080
extractor could be constructed for this

219
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,399
snorlax argument

220
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,240
first we recall the verification

221
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,039
equation which looks like this

222
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,120
we construct an extractor such that it

223
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,360
runs the prover twice on two different

224
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,920
challenges c0 and c1

225
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,839
to get two different communication

226
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,320
transcripts both of which satisfy the

227
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,240
verification equation

228
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,480
and in matrix form they can be written

229
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,279
as shown on the screen right now

230
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,920
next the extractor would try to solve

231
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,240
the following dual random one system for

232
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,120
a vector z over the ring r

233
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,839
i call this a dual random system because

234
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,760
this system of linear equations is

235
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,160
defined by the transpose of a venomone

236
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,240
system defined by c0 and c1

237
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
suppose the extractor is successful in

238
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,160
solving the dual random system for the

239
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,279
vector z

240
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,880
then it can compute the extractive

241
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,839
witness like this

242
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
let us look at the second example of

243
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,320
snorlax arguments which is the lattice

244
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,640
bulletproof system proposed in crypto

245
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,480
20.

246
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,399
for this system we make additional

247
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,160
structural assumptions about the

248
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,880
statement a y and the vector x so that

249
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,680
the matrix a can be split into two parts

250
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,800
a0 and a1 of equal dimensions and

251
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,959
similarly the witness x can be split

252
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,600
into two parts x 0 and x 1 of equal

253
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,440
dimensions

254
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,600
in this way if the vector x indeed

255
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,839
satisfies the statement a y with no

256
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,720
slack then y can be written as a x which

257
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,480
is equal to a 0 times x 0 plus a1 times

258
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,200
x1 modulo q

259
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,040
given these assumptions the lattice

260
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,839
bulletproof system goes as follows

261
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,600
first the prover computes the cross

262
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,440
terms between the matrix a and the

263
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,320
vector x that is it computes the vector

264
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,079
y 0 1 which is equal to a 0 times x 1

265
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,560
and the vector y 1 0 which is equal to a

266
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,320
1 times x 0.

267
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,959
after receiving the vectors y 0 1 and y

268
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,760
1 0 the verifier would again sample a

269
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,959
challenge c from the challenge set big c

270
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,920
and send this challenge to the prover

271
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,240
finally the prover would respond with x

272
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
hat which is computed as a linear

273
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,560
combination of x0 and x1

274
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,399
notice that the set of verification

275
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,640
equations checked by the verifier is

276
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,920
nothing but another sis relation

277
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,160
but here the witness x hat is of

278
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,399
dimension half that of the original

279
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,600
witness x therefore by recursively

280
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,680
composing this protocol a logarithmic

281
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,760
number of times one would obtain an

282
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,079
argument system for the sis relation

283
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,160
with only logarithmic communication

284
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,480
costs

285
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,200
like in the first example we notice that

286
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,440
the knowledge error of this protocol is

287
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,760
again inversely proportional to the size

288
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,360
of the challenge set

289
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,279
therefore if we want to achieve inverse

290
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,440
polynomial knowledge error we again want

291
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,680
to use a polynomial size challenge set

292
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,920
as before let us look at how a knowledge

293
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,760
extractor can be constructed for the

294
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,399
lattice bulletproof

295
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,800
first recall the verification equation

296
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,839
shown on the screen right now

297
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,920
this time our knowledge extractor would

298
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,240
run the proof of p three times instead

299
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,920
of two times on three different

300
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,519
challenges c0 c1 and c2 to obtain three

301
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,600
different accepting communication

302
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,160
transcripts

303
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,399
in matrix form these communication

304
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,079
transcripts would satisfy the

305
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,240
verification equation shown on the

306
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,040
screen right now

307
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,959
then the knowledge extractor would try

308
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,200
to solve the following three-dimensional

309
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,760
dual random one system again for vector

310
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,040
z over the ring r

311
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,360
if it is successful for finding such a

312
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,320
vector z it can compute the witness x

313
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,639
tilde as shown on the screen now

314
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,320
you might have already observed a

315
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,720
pattern that the knowledge extractor is

316
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,800
always going to solve a dual random

317
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,000
system of a certain dimension

318
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
therefore a natural question to ask is

319
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,680
for what challenges c0 up to ct minus 1

320
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,399
and slack s is the following dual random

321
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,560
one system solvable over the ring r

322
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,519
our observation is that if for all i

323
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,480
from 0 to t minus 1 the slack s is

324
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,279
divisible by the product of c i minus c

325
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,079
j for all j not equal to i

326
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,480
then the dual random system is solvable

327
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,040
over r

328
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,360
this motivates us to define the notion

329
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,839
of st subjective set

330
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,480
we say that a set c which is a subset of

331
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,279
the ring is st subjective

332
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,160
if for any t subset big t which is equal

333
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,440
to c zero up to c t minus one

334
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,560
it holds that for all i from 0 to t

335
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,680
minus 1 the slack s is divisible by the

336
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,800
product of c i minus c j with j running

337
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,279
through 0 to t minus 1 except for i

338
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,839
furthermore if the slack s equals to 1

339
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,680
we simply say that the set c is

340
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,160
subtractive

341
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,480
before i move on let me say a few things

342
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,240
about the relationship between

343
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,519
subjective sets and secret sharing

344
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,959
we notice that if c is an st subtractive

345
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,040
set then for any t subset big t of c

346
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,120
not only is the new random one system

347
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,240
defined by t solvable over r but also

348
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,279
the venomone system which is exactly the

349
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,040
system of linear equations that one

350
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,199
would solve when performing polynomial

351
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,120
interpolation

352
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,360
therefore it is natural to see that if

353
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,480
the set c is st subtractive then one can

354
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,839
use c as a set of evaluation points when

355
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,079
constructing t out of n sequence sharing

356
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,240
over the ring r

357
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,399
to summarize here are some sample

358
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,519
implications of st subtractive sets

359
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,560
first if we have an s3 subtractive set

360
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,000
of size n

361
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
then we can construct a lattice bullet

362
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,800
proof with slack s and knowledge error 2

363
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,279
over n

364
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,920
on the other hand if we have an st

365
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,560
subtractive set of size n then we could

366
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,880
construct lattice-based t out of n

367
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,920
threshold primitives

368
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,279
at this point hopefully you are

369
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,440
convinced that st subtractive sets are

370
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
some useful objects

371
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
therefore the remaining challenge is to

372
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,800
construct large st subtractive sets and

373
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,440
by large i mean polynomial size with

374
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,920
small slack s over some interesting ring

375
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,160
r

376
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,000
for example in lattice-based

377
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,720
cryptography a popular choice of r would

378
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,199
be a psychoatomic ring

379
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,920
which is the set of rational integers c

380
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
adjoined with a primitive m root of

381
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,880
unity c to m where m is polynomial size

382
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,199
to sum up here are our results of

383
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,160
subjective sets over psychoatomic rings

384
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,720
first for power of two psychotomic rings

385
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,199
that is when m is the power of two we

386
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,000
can construct a family of st subjective

387
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,519
sets of size n for a wide range of s t

388
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,279
and n

389
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,519
for example we can construct two free

390
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,240
subjective set of size m over two plus

391
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,959
one which use a bullet proof with stack

392
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,199
two

393
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,839
on the negative side we show that it is

394
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,480
impossible to construct a family of two

395
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,199
t subjective sets where the family is

396
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,199
parametrized by m

397
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,480
such that the m set cm is of size

398
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,399
strictly greater than m plus 1.

399
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,560
moving over to prime power

400
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,120
psychotheramic rings that is when m is

401
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,600
equal to a power of a prime p

402
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,759
we can construct a family of subjective

403
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,959
sets without slack of size p

404
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,160
which yields bullet proof with no slack

405
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,320
on the negative side we prove a matching

406
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,480
impossibility result which says that

407
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,880
there is no subtractive set c of size

408
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,320
strictly greater than p

409
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,839
if we instantiate the lattice

410
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,920
bulletproof system with the st

411
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,240
subtractive sets constructed above we

412
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,320
obtain lattice bullet proofs with better

413
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,600
parameters

414
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
the improved parameters are partly due

415
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,920
to the use of better subjective sets and

416
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,560
partly due to a more careful analysis

417
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,040
on the negative side we show that for

418
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,519
snorlax protocols it is impossible to

419
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,680
have both small knowledge error and

420
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,360
small slack

421
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,439
we see this as a technical barrier for

422
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,359
constructing better lattice-based

423
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,839
argument systems

424
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,480
finally we also demonstrate how st

425
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,959
subjective sets can be used to construct

426
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,520
threshold primitives using distributed

427
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,880
pseudorandom functions as an example

428
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,959
before going to the technical detail let

429
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,280
me lay down some mathematical background

430
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,439
and intuition

431
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,919
in essence the results in this paper

432
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,919
critically rely on the presence and

433
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,559
absence of ideals in the ring r and

434
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,320
therefore i should briefly talk about

435
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
ideals

436
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,200
for a ring element c the ideal generated

437
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,600
by c written as bracket c

438
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,520
is the set of all ring elements which

439
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,679
can be written as a product between c

440
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,000
and another ring element in other words

441
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,640
the idea generated by c is the set of

442
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,000
all ring elements divisible by c

443
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,559
using language of ideals the definition

444
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,960
of st subtractive sets can be rewritten

445
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,440
as follows

446
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,799
we say that a set c is st subjective if

447
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,160
for any t subset big t of c and any

448
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,400
element c in big t

449
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,480
we have that the slack s belongs to the

450
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,280
ideal generated by the product between

451
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,160
the differences between c and c prime

452
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,400
for all c prime in t which is different

453
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,880
from c

454
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,160
let us think about intuitively how hard

455
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,960
is it to construct large st subtractive

456
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,720
sets for small slag s

457
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,440
notice that to construct such a set we

458
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,520
want lots of elements to divide the

459
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,840
small slack

460
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,799
s

461
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,960
suppose our ring r is the ring of

462
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,760
rational integers z it is going to be

463
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,280
difficult because of the following

464
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,000
observations

465
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,039
for example if s is equal to 1 we notice

466
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,360
that the only invertible elements in z

467
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,919
are negative 1 and 1. these are the only

468
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,840
elements that divides s which is 1.

469
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,720
suppose that s is slightly bigger namely

470
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,559
that s is equal to 2

471
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,720
still the only factors of 2 are negative

472
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,000
2 negative 1 1 and 2.

473
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,240
over a cycloatomic ring however the

474
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,600
situation is a little bit different

475
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,919
for example in a power of 2 psychoatomic

476
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,400
range of order 2 to the l

477
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,960
the element 1 minus theta to the power k

478
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,440
is the factor of 2 whenever 2 to the l

479
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,640
does not divide k

480
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,120
similarly over a prime power cycle

481
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,320
atomic ring of order p to the l the

482
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,960
element 1 minus theta to the k over 1

483
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,000
minus theta is invertible whenever p and

484
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,840
k are co prime

485
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,160
with these observations we see that it

486
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,559
is quite a bit easier to construct st

487
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,039
subtractive sets over a cycle atomic

488
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,039
ring then in the ring of rational

489
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,520
integers

490
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
with these intuitions let me present to

491
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,799
you a flavor of our technical results

492
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,799
we first focus on the simplest setting

493
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,360
of prime power cycle atomic rings that

494
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,240
is when order of the ring is p to the l

495
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,799
consider the ring element mu k which is

496
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,520
defined by 1 minus theta to the power k

497
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,200
over 1 minus theta

498
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,240
as introduced in the previous slide

499
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,559
we showed that the set c which consists

500
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,000
of mu 0 mu 1 up to mu p minus 1 is

501
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,919
subtractive

502
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,760
to see this let us recall that the

503
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,480
element mu k is invertible over the ring

504
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,640
r whenever p and k are co-prime

505
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,280
next we realize that for i smaller than

506
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,080
j

507
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,880
the difference between mu j and mu i can

508
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,360
be written as theta to the power i times

509
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
mu j minus i

510
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,400
since both zeta and mu j minus i are

511
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,039
invertible over r the product of them is

512
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,520
also invertible over r

513
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,280
on the negative side we show that there

514
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,679
is no subtractive set c of psi strictly

515
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,840
greater than

516
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,240
p to see this we first realize that the

517
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,679
ideal generated by 1 minus theta has p

518
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,720
cosets and the element 1 does not belong

519
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,880
to this idea

520
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,280
suppose there exists a subtractive set c

521
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,000
of psi strictly greater than p

522
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,240
then by the pigeonhole principle

523
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,360
there must exist distinct c0 and c1 in

524
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,720
the set c

525
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,880
such that the difference between c0 and

526
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,600
c1 belongs to the ideal generated by 1

527
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,320
minus theta

528
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,559
however by assumption we know that c is

529
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,520
subtractive which means that c 0 minus c

530
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,280
1 is invertible

531
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,760
which implies the element 1 belongs to

532
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,320
the ideal generated by one minus theta

533
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,400
which is a contradiction

534
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
next we move to the setting of power of

535
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
two psychoatomic rings where i would

536
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,080
like to show you the following theorem

537
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,760
but since there are too many variables

538
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,919
to worry about let us consider the

539
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,080
following special case which says that

540
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,880
the following set c is 2 3 subtractive

541
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,600
and the set c consists of the element 0

542
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,880
1 theta c square up to c third to the

543
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,320
power euler phi of m minus 1 where since

544
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,799
m is the power of 2 euler phi of m is

545
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,080
simply m over 2.

546
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
to prove this theorem we first notice

547
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,240
that the element 0 is given to us for

548
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,400
free because all the other elements in

549
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
the set c are invertible

550
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,080
and therefore the differences between

551
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,158
them and 0 are invertible as well

552
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,280
next without loss of generality let us

553
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,240
consider a set t of 3 elements which can

554
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,120
be written as c to the a c to the b and

555
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,640
c d to the c

556
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,559
where a is smaller than b and b is

557
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,280
smaller than c

558
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,080
next we want to show that the element 2

559
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,240
belongs to the ideal generated by the

560
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,520
product c to the a minus theta to the b

561
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,600
times theta to the a minus theta to the

562
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,799
c

563
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,120
and for convenience we call this ideal i

564
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,760
first we notice that c to the a is

565
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,799
invertible and therefore the ideal i is

566
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,799
equal to the ideal generated by the

567
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,919
product 1 minus theta to the b minus a

568
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,400
times 1 minus theta to the c minus a

569
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,440
next by some routine calculation we show

570
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,320
that the exponents b minus a and c minus

571
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,120
a

572
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,840
can be taken out so that the ideal i is

573
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,480
equal to the ideal generated by 1 minus

574
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,240
theta to the power of the even part of b

575
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,919
minus a plus the even part of c minus a

576
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,320
where the even part of b minus a is the

577
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,960
largest power of 2 which divides b minus

578
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,120
a

579
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,240
finally we make two observations

580
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,400
the first is that the element two

581
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,120
belongs to the ideal generated by one

582
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,720
minus theta to the power phi of m

583
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,279
and second the sum of the even parts of

584
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,400
b minus a and c minus a is at most phi

585
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,520
of m

586
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
and therefore the ideal that the element

587
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,240
2 belongs to is just a subset of the

588
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,679
ideal i

589
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,760
therefore we conclude that 2 is also in

590
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,559
the ideal i

591
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,960
as the final result in this talk let me

592
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,120
show you that there is no family of two

593
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,000
t subtractive sets parametrized by m

594
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,640
such that the m set is of size strictly

595
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,520
greater than n plus one

596
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,000
to show that there is no such family it

597
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,320
suffices to find one single m such that

598
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,880
there is no 2t subtractive set of size

599
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,919
strictly greater than m plus 1.

600
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,720
for this purpose let m to be a power of

601
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,679
2 greater than 4 such that m plus 1 is a

602
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,880
prime

603
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,200
these primes are called fermat primes

604
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,760
and currently known examples include 5

605
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,080
17 257 and 65537

606
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,240
for any of these m we notice that any

607
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,279
vector ideal i of the ideal generated by

608
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,200
m plus 1 has exactly m plus 1 cosets

609
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,600
and the element 2 does not belong to the

610
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,240
ideal i

611
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,600
suppose that c is a 2t subtractive set

612
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,679
and the size of c is strictly greater

613
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,400
than n plus 1.

614
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,720
then by the pigeonhole principle again

615
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,279
there must exist two distinct elements

616
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,080
c0 and c1 of big c

617
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,799
so that the difference between c0 and c1

618
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,840
belongs to the ideal i

619
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,559
however by assumption we have that c is

620
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,760
2t subjective and therefore the element

621
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,080
2 is divisible by the difference between

622
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,279
c0 and 1 which means that 2 belongs to

623
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,480
the ideal i which is a contradiction

624
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,720
to conclude in this work we formalized

625
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,600
the notion of st subtractive sets we

626
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,679
applied them to snow-like arguments and

627
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,600
threshold square sharing

628
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,840
we constructed polynomial size st

629
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,480
subjective sets over cyclatomic rings

630
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,320
with almost matching impossibility

631
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,120
results we obtained improved lattice

632
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,039
bulletproofs by instantiating the

633
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,360
construction with better st subjective

634
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,919
sets and finally we showed that there's

635
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,400
a trade-off between knowledge error and

636
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,440
slack for snorlax arguments

637
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,279
for the full technical details of our

results i encourage you to check out our
