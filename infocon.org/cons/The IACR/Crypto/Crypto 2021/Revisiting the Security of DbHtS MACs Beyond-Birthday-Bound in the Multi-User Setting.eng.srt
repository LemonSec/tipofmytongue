00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,520
hello everyone my name is yavin shan

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,680
today i'll talk is revisiting the

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,400
security of dbhd marks beyond busted

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,280
bank in the mud user setting

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,719
this is the joint work with day one tau

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,519
and the tian tm1

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,199
our talk is divided into four parts the

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,199
first one is the background of about

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,599
dbhd max the second one is the

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,000
multi-user's security results of

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,400
deviation marks the first one is our

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,280
attack on 2k f9 the final one is the

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,920
conclusion

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,120
message authentic code is one of the

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,760
symmetric key primitive to

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,480
provide integrity and also authenticity

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,840
of messages

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,920
a sender and the receiver will firstly

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,000
share a secret key and then use these

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
algorithm to authenticate messages

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,120
there are many two ways to build the

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,960
mark

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,359
why is using a block cipher

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,680
with a long example including cbc mark

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,520
or marked landmark

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,360
the second second one is using a hash

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,479
function

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,880
we know explore including h mark and

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,080
mark in landmark

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,960
most of these masks throw in the harsh

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,439
lampi paradise

32
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,200
there is a message

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,680
a message will first made by

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,720
a universal hash function to produce

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,400
a fixed dense

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,640
string let's typically use ambient and

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,439
this mb string will be

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,799
proceed by

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,439
a fixed lens input

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,479
prf to produce the the fan attack

41
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,600
one drawback of this product is that

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,079
when the

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,240
of the internal output of this has

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,159
function collide

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,520
then the output tags we also client and

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,920
this creation will usually

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,600
uh result in

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,840
a vertical attack for this can structure

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,560
and so and the capacity to find this

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,280
region is the birthday bank there is 2

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,160
to the power half n and is also called

52
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,359
birthday bank security

53
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,680
but the burst debunks basically is not

54
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,000
always enough in practice

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,959
especially when the mark is instantiated

56
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,840
with lightweight block ciphers such as

57
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,239
high present or gift

58
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,440
or

59
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,879
the legacy block cipher triple dash

60
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,200
this block cipher has a sure block size

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,560
there's 64 bits and so the birthday bank

62
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,760
security will become their tutor 32

63
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
which is somewhat small

64
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,920
and vulnerable in some application

65
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,120
for example but gavin and lauren has

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,280
them have that demonstrated practical

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,160
attack

68
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,360
next exploit region showbox cipher

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
to break the security of tls and open

70
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,280
open vpn protocols

71
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,680
so to overcome the birthday bound

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,720
barrier

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,400
a class of mass has been

74
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,760
successfully proposed

75
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,000
including the summit cbc pima plus

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,400
ckf9 and data plus

77
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,440
interestingly uh this

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,879
this marks

79
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,760
follows a similar structuralist called

80
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,280
double block harsh then sum

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400
this

82
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,599
structure is actuated out by data or in

83
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,679
the 2019

84
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,959
instead of using an ambit block hash

85
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,560
function

86
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,560
this paradigm this constructors use a

87
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,280
2mb hash function

88
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,159
and

89
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,360
and the image youtube will pro will make

90
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,400
by this

91
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,959
to ambit hash function to produce a 2mb

92
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,480
input

93
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,360
tool of through block cipher and then

94
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,040
the two encrypted values will be extras

95
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,959
some to produce different attack so the

96
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,959
previous attack on the internal

97
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,079
collision

98
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,279
uh

99
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,479
requires a bounce a capacity lesbian the

100
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,120
basic bomb

101
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,960
let's briefly uh recall the recent

102
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,720
result for this for dbh marks

103
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,360
uh data out adobe probably list this

104
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,199
generic framework and achieve the

105
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,919
vmware's bank security that's q to the

106
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,600
power 3

107
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,479
over 2 to the power 2 n

108
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,840
and lauren

109
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,440
at all and

110
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,800
proposed the first virtually attack on

111
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,160
on this

112
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,440
longest max with a capacity 2 to the

113
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,720
power

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
3 and 4.

115
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,280
so there is this gap between the

116
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,240
probable bounce and the

117
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,199
attack complexity

118
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,720
listen looking let all uh close list

119
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,759
this gap and prove a typescript

120
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,840
for this

121
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,000
for this class dbh mass this that is q

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,440
to the power

123
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,840
4 3 over 2 to the power n

124
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,120
at this stage it seems the story of the

125
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,560
deviated mass

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,400
is reasonably complete

127
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,160
but however the abroad previous bank

128
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,360
security only considered a single user

129
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,520
layers they only consider the adversary

130
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,600
only tax only tax a single user

131
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,639
but in practice the adversary can attack

132
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,039
multiple users adaptively distributing

133
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,720
issue resources

134
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,759
this is particularly true for mark

135
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,240
which is one of the most commonly used

136
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,319
cryptographic cryptocurrency algorithm

137
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,520
practice

138
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,080
mark is the core

139
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,600
element of the real world security

140
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,080
protocols such as ssl sh ipsec

141
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,039
and it has bmw active users in major

142
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,039
websites

143
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,600
so the question is uh how the number of

144
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,560
users will affect the security of mass

145
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,319
and more concretely can dbhd mass still

146
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,000
achieve beyond based bank security in

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,720
the materials setting

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,639
if we're using the staff actually

149
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,199
reduction

150
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,400
for marks from single-use security to

151
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,680
remote user security let's we simply

152
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,599
multiply

153
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,240
the single user bound by the number of

154
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,599
users

155
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,240
then the might use the security of dbh1

156
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,520
will become

157
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,759
something like u

158
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,240
q to the power 3 over 2 to the power 2 n

159
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,199
or u

160
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,919
q

161
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,960
power

162
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,400
4 over 2 to the power n

163
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
here u is the number of users q is the

164
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,639
number of queries

165
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,680
uh and if the adversary uses one query

166
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,160
per user then the boundary becomes the

167
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,160
q2 q to the power 4 over 2 to 2n

168
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,199
or q to the power

169
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,880
7 3 over 2 to the power n

170
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,000
then the q is at most 2 to the power

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,240
half analog a 2 to the power 3

172
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,639
instruments which is the euler

173
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,400
kept at the burst level or even worse

174
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
than the burstly bond

175
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
solar security loss of the

176
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,520
general reduction is is large

177
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,639
so a

178
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,800
direct arrangement of the musicity of

179
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,960
dbht max is much desired

180
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,840
and our contributions are

181
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,800
manifold we first proposed a generic

182
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,720
security

183
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,440
uh framework in a multi-user setting for

184
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
deviation marks

185
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,879
there are two

186
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,680
properties of our this our framework the

187
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,960
first one is it has a good usability one

188
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,360
only need to prove that hash pass is if

189
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
the one regular and if some two almost

190
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,560
mimic so

191
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,840
here if the one regular implies that

192
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,599
the hash value

193
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,919
collide to a given string is small

194
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
the property of the hash value

195
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,679
equals to a given string is small and

196
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,080
its own two almost imminent so implies

197
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,958
that

198
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,240
the probability of the too harsh value

199
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,240
of two different string clients is more

200
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,839
the second property is that it can

201
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,240
achieve a high security lesbian reversal

202
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,480
run

203
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,920
we also show the usability of network

204
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,320
with the application to keep reduced

205
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,560
rating of dbh marks

206
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,200
including 2k some ecbc 2 kpm pima plus

207
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,760
and 2k let me plus and prove this mask

208
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,959
and achieve

209
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,880
i can still achieve the bmw in the

210
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,839
multi-user setting

211
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,399
there is a remaining one the dbhd mallet

212
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,040
called the 2k f9

213
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
but for this one we cannot prove its

214
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,760
security

215
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,440
instead we find a critical flow in it

216
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,080
this question is proved by data or in

217
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,680
the

218
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,800
fc fc 2019a can achieve the bmw's bank

219
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,600
security but unfortunately we find the

220
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,680
late one query is enough to further

221
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,880
attack

222
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,040
and we also show a birthday attack on

223
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,319
several variants of 2k f9

224
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,040
this is the main theorem in our paper

225
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,399
here for simplicity we assume h is 1

226
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,360
over 2 to the power n given 1 over 2 to

227
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,079
the power n almost universal and also a

228
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,600
mean or lower the tens and small

229
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,560
constant vectors

230
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,399
and here q is the number of marked

231
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,399
queries p is the number of the occipital

232
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,279
queries n is the length of block size k

233
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,240
is the length of keys

234
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
as can can be seen in

235
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,519
in our theory that this bond is beyond

236
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,640
baseband with respect to both q and p

237
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,800
and moreover a response is independent

238
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
of the number of users which can be as

239
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,680
large as q

240
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,160
uh if we compare our bond with the

241
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,920
general reduction

242
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,200
for a genetic reduction there is q to

243
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,120
the power of over 2 to the power n when

244
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,760
q reach the first level that

245
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,800
2 to the half n you will become varnish

246
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,320
where for our bond

247
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,959
when q equals the first bond is 2 to the

248
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,600
power half and it is still reasonably

249
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,000
small

250
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,760
more concretely for the most

251
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,399
lightweight cycle the block size is

252
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,120
64 bits and the the cadence can be one

253
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,640
to the ideas

254
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,440
and the burst bank becomes two to the

255
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,720
power

256
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,560
32 then the the first we need to query

257
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,440
a 32 gig gb online data

258
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,760
and yet returns relating the loss of

259
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,920
communication

260
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,000
of the reverse theory

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,480
this captured by the number of idea

262
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,680
server id of subquery becomes

263
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,200
the plo over 2 160 plus q p over what 2

264
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,399
to the power 1 3 92 plus

265
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,000
p square over 2 to the power

266
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,920
224 which is small

267
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,600
and we our this is the

268
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,480
security model in our security game in

269
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,240
our proof

270
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,800
we want to mention here that our proof

271
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,279
is down in ideal cycle model

272
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,440
there are two main reasons why we choose

273
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,720
this this model the first one is that

274
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,880
in the market user setting we are

275
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,720
particularly concerned how the local

276
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,800
communication of the battery will affect

277
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,320
secretly bound

278
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,959
which is captured by the number of idea

279
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,560
cyber query

280
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,920
understand the model does not help here

281
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,760
the second one is that in a standard

282
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,120
model

283
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,800
we usually model a block cipher as a prp

284
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,000
and which will increase

285
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,839
secret loss

286
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,040
and this isolated security loss will be

287
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,360
problematic in the

288
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,440
mario's setting to go beyond the bank

289
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,760
requires the key to be longer than

290
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,880
ambient instant model while in the ideal

291
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,079
circle

292
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,120
uh

293
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,000
using mb keys is enough to go beyond the

294
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,760
best bang for the dbhd max

295
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,200
let's let's give overview of our proof

296
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
our proof relies on the edge coefficient

297
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,360
techniques

298
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,399
we define two class of bad events that

299
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,959
is called a

300
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,000
good event and better event respectively

301
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,079
for better even the goal is to guarantee

302
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,800
that for each user

303
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,079
at is one of the class key and proxima

304
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,360
key is range

305
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,519
and also to guarantee less requires to

306
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,800
the same user and it is one of the two

307
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000
inputs to the block cipher is fresh

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,160
and also guarantee that requires to

309
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,240
different users if the block cipher key

310
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,120
collab with other keys then the input to

311
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,760
this block cipher should be fresh

312
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,519
after that the analysis for the

313
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,040
bet events is relatively easy and we

314
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,639
default of

315
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,000
detail proof

316
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,680
to the to our paper

317
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,920
we show the

318
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,839
usability of our

319
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,000
application proof framework

320
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,800
to three key reduced radial deviation

321
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,120
marks

322
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,839
as mentioned in in previous slide we

323
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,000
only need to prove that hajj path that

324
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,160
is right to probability less if someone

325
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,480
regular and if some two almost universal

326
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,760
at least is the figure of 2k some sbc

327
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
you use the two independent keys for

328
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
each hard part

329
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,000
and the hash function is the concretion

330
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,760
to cpc max

331
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,000
so we simply need to prove that cbc

332
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,399
marks yeah the first part

333
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,399
satisfied is more regular and from true

334
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,320
almost universal

335
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,880
and also prove that second passively we

336
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,560
can also prove the second power so

337
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,320
certifies from one localization to

338
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,959
almost universal after that

339
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,160
uh we can apply our base theory to this

340
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,880
construction and obtain the beyond based

341
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,680
bank security of this

342
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,199
construction in the mighty user setting

343
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,800
this is our

344
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,839
result in the paper

345
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,800
for 2k letterman plus

346
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,240
the hash function is a bit a bit more

347
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,040
complicated

348
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,320
the hash function the hash price payroll

349
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,680
polarizable

350
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,040
and

351
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,759
he also used the fuel modification

352
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,440
on the second part of the hash function

353
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,160
but again we can prove that the first

354
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,040
part of hash function

355
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,199
satisfied is molecular and strong 2

356
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,160
almost universal

357
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,000
and similarly we can also prove the

358
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,480
second part of hash function 65 is

359
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,399
molecular if the two or more universal

360
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,839
but at this stage we cannot directly

361
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,800
apply our steering to this construction

362
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
the coverage here is that

363
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,320
the first part of the second part

364
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,399
of the hash function use the same key

365
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,839
that's allowed

366
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,759
about in in theory it is assumed these

367
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,040
two parts used to independent keys

368
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,959
so we need to additionally use the

369
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,399
relationship

370
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,360
between these two parts and we'll

371
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,440
increase uh

372
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,560
another 10 but it is oh it is the other

373
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,800
beyond best bang

374
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,880
after that we can

375
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,320
apply our main theory

376
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,560
to

377
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,440
to this construction with the state

378
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,399
motivation modification

379
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,399
and obtain the vmware's debug security

380
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,519
in the multi-user setting

381
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,759
we also show the application through 2k

382
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,680
pmr plus

383
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,560
the

384
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,439
hash function to kpma plus is similar to

385
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,839
the two character plus it is

386
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,319
parallelizable

387
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,799
and we also proved that the

388
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,119
first plot the hash function says this

389
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,720
file that is from right is the one

390
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,039
regular and so two almost universal

391
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,559
and similarly we can prove that the

392
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,640
second part has functions that is fine

393
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,880
if the one regular and epsilon 2 almost

394
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,039
universal

395
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,000
and similarly the first part and the

396
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,760
second part of hash function use the

397
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,880
same key

398
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,640
so we also need to

399
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,360
analyze the relationship between each

400
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,678
part

401
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,440
and out of that

402
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,799
we can

403
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,600
apply our material to this contract

404
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,880
construction with the size and

405
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,640
multiplication

406
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,760
and

407
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,080
to let this construction

408
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,320
is beyond the state bank in the market

409
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,200
user setting

410
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,880
uh for the

411
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,480
remaining one

412
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,440
key reduced radio dbhd max we cannot

413
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,840
produce security

414
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,160
uh this construction is proved to

415
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,840
achieve the beyond baseband security in

416
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,640
a single user setting by data at all

417
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,799
but we find

418
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,520
that a a simple attack that for any

419
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
short message ambu

420
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,799
with

421
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,880
with the bro with the length less than

422
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,440
ambient and will become a symbol single

423
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,280
block after painting

424
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,520
m and zero is always a

425
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,640
is always available and sas embedded

426
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,039
that the birthday bank security resolved

427
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,039
a previous paper

428
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,679
one can check it very quickly for a

429
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,720
single block message

430
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
after the encryption of the first block

431
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,120
cipher

432
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,080
the input to the first input to the last

433
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,919
block cipher and the second input last

434
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,240
book cipher

435
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,360
are sent so the corresponding output tag

436
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,960
will be zero

437
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,240
so this attack will success with

438
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,640
property one and it only requires one

439
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,640
query

440
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,240
we then try to

441
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,679
fix

442
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,480
the 2k f9 our first attempt is user

443
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,520
domain a one bit domain separation on

444
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,280
the

445
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,000
last block cipher

446
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,160
this domain separation will fix the

447
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,039
string the most significant bit of

448
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,440
string to be one to be zero

449
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,320
and this will fix the most six seconds

450
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,559
significant bit of strain to b1

451
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,120
but we find is a domain separation does

452
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,440
not work for the 2k f9

453
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,600
that for any two mastery m1 and m2

454
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,480
and 1 and 2 are both to block mystery

455
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,600
and if

456
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,480
uh

457
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,600
if this relation should exist then the

458
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,360
upper attack will cried

459
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,880
and find such a pair of

460
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,960
x y only requires the best blunt

461
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,679
complexity

462
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,159
so we can use this pair to

463
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,440
to construct a footery

464
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,159
and if we use more complicated

465
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,120
operation there is multiplied by true

466
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,200
before the one being

467
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,880
one bit

468
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,799
one bit domain operation

469
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,039
we find a similar birthday bank attack

470
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,760
still works

471
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,880
and we use the more complicated

472
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,480
operation let's mark multiply a constant

473
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,679
in

474
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,039
in each block

475
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,240
us just as in the case of 2k that like

476
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,919
them a plus or 2k people plus

477
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,880
we find a similar birthday bank attack

478
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,679
still works

479
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,159
the reason behind is flaw is that

480
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,440
uh

481
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
we can always always find a relationship

482
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,080
between the first input to the last

483
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,159
process and the second input to the last

484
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,039
block cipher that is if the first input

485
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,919
rubric several kite then also the second

486
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,080
input to the last proxy for

487
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,640
and find this collision requires a

488
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,559
birthday bank complexity

489
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,840
and will

490
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,080
usually result in a

491
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,280
virtually attack

492
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,240
and

493
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,120
but not that such reduced relation does

494
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,440
not exist in the 2k some species to

495
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,880
collect my plus

496
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,919
or 2k pm plus the reason is that for 2k

497
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,120
some

498
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,480
ecbc

499
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,240
the two inputs of the last box cypher

500
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,520
are produced

501
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,360
by using two independent block cyber

502
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,080
keys so they've been independent from

503
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,200
each other

504
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,000
and for 2k elastomer plus and 2k primary

505
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,600
plus we can prove

506
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,120
that the

507
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,200
probability that such relationship

508
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,960
exists is very small

509
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,440
here comes our conclusion

510
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,200
we proposed a

511
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,520
secure must use the proof framework for

512
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,760
dbhd marks

513
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,480
and proof led to get some usbc

514
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,240
to get pima plus

515
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,200
2k less than my plus still achieve the

516
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,880
best bank security in the multi-user

517
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,000
framework in a much user setting

518
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,919
and for

519
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,400
the last one they took f9

520
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
we

521
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,960
we find a critical flaw in it

522
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,720
and short

523
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,080
and also show up a busted bomb attack on

524
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,840
several variants of 2kf9

525
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,919
there are some interesting future work

526
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,960
uh the first one is that uh can we fix

527
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,640
together light to go beyond reverse

528
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,919
debunk

529
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,640
this question seems not trivial because

530
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,440
as shown in our paper by using a simple

531
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,960
trick can not help to get f9 to copy

532
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,480
university bond

533
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,600
the second one is that where can can we

534
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,200
improve the security the

535
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,720
current user security of dbhm

536
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,360
are not led in a single user dbh market

537
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,799
achieve the 3 over 4b security

538
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,880
but currently approval can only achieve

539
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,480
that 2n

540
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,559
over 3b security

541
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,720
so where can we improve the

542
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,120
security bound of dbhm in the multi-user

543
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,520
setting is an interesting question

544
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,360
okay that's all

545
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,240
and thanks for your attention

546
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,279
if you you have any question you can

547
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,240
just

548
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,520
send email

549
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,960
to me

550
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,840
thank you
