contributions to

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,720
the cryptographic hardware and embedded

195
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,319
systems and for service to data acr

196
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,639
so ingrid

197
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,120
was they can could not attend

198
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,879
this event and also

199
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,160
chose to speak at a later event

200
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,280
and by the way due to this kovid's

201
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,840
situation

202
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,479
several normally all of the fellows

203
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,280
would

204
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,319
be receiving a plaque

205
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,879
for their contributions and for becoming

206
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,160
a fellow

207
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,080
but just like last year this is not

208
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,319
possible to do it in person that we

209
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,840
expected in a future

210
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,960
event to be able to uh get together with

211
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,680
everybody and actually be able to give a

212
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,519
plug in person

213
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,000
instead of like i could always mail that

214
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,399
the the black to directly to them but i

215
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,360
think it's it would be nicer to do it in

216
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
person

217
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,320
so

218
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,440
so this

219
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,200
concludes the fellow section of the

220
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,480
program

221
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,399
but uh

222
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,839

223
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,080

we would like

364
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,920
you can uh see the slides i think

365
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,800
yeah

366
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,880
okay so um i guess i'll be speaking this

367
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,440
is going to be a co-presentation but um

368
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,760
hope tells okay she was we were emailing

369
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,160
uh 40 minutes ago 30 minutes ago and

370
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,880
then uh cut out so i wonder if she had a

371
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,360
power outage or some other emergency

372
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,240
but i will do my best uh simulation

373
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,639
of her for the first half of this

374
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,519
uh so this is our uh report from the

375
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,880
program chairs um a variety of uh

376
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,800
interesting and hopefully useful

377
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,000
information for you um so

378
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,680
let me get it to go forward okay there

379
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,399
we go

380
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,680
um so

381
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,959
as usual the uh the crypto

382
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,519
uh review process was a double blind

383
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,720
review so all papers were anonymous and

384
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,680
reviews uh on those papers were

385
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,959
anonymous

386
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,760
and uh we aim to have uh at least three

387
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
reviews per paper we achieved that in

388
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,440
almost every case probably 97 plus uh of

389
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,600
the papers at least three reviews um

390
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,000
this year as in uh some recent years we

391
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,760
had a rebuttal phase

392
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,560
so the reviews were returned to the

393
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,600
authors

394
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,360
and then the authors had an opportunity

395
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,720
to respond to any questions or

396
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,399
misunderstandings

397
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,800
about the paper and then that phase was

398
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,199
followed by uh another uh discussion

399
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,759
phase of several weeks um that went i

400
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,600
think very well we got a lot of good uh

401
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,079
feedback uh opinions were changed uh

402
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,399
both uh positively and negatively based

403
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,279
on the

404
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,600
feedback uh obtained in the rebuttal

405
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,800
phase and uh also it was a very good

406
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,199
checkpoint uh by which people had to get

407
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,199
their reviews in and it served to serve

408
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,240
that well

409
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,480
um there was a of course a natural

410
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,440
conflict of interest policy that we

411
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,240
went with on reviews and awards uh

412
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,720
especially for the awards um that was

413
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,360
adhered to very carefully and the pc uh

414
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,720
chairs did not

415
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,839
participate uh in giving reviews or

416
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,639
voting on the uh awards so the process

417
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,480
was generally the same as in previous

418
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,399
years especially last year when

419
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,279
everything was uh suddenly online

420
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,720
um we had uh as with uh now the 1000

421
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,079
plus

422
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,519
official registrations for the

423
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,920
conference we were breaking records in a

424
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,839
number of other categories

425
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,560
we had 430 paper submissions to the

426
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,880
conference which is an all-time record

427
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,759
and we accepted 103 of those which is

428
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,240
also an all-time record and that comes

429
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,360
to an acceptance rate of about 24

430
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,680
which is in line with uh the previous

431
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,120
several years

432
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,440
there were

433
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,959
1087 distinct reviews on these papers

434
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,119
and there were 58 pc members as well as

435
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,240
a

436
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,319
small advisory committee

437
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,039
of the previous pc chairs and next

438
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,359
year's pc chairs

439
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,319
there were also uh in addition to the 58

440
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,280
members uh on the pc

441
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,839
390

442
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,880
external reviewers uh many of whom

443
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,720
submitted multiple reviews

444
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,960
and the number of threads in my crypto

445
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,200
2020 2021 folder is in excess of 1300

446
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,160
and probably still growing um of course

447
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,360
each thread has multiple messages needed

448
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,640
okay so uh moving on from uh to some

449
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,720
additional stats this is just the

450
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,960
numbers the record-breaking numbers that

451
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,679
we have this year in context uh in the

452
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,039
past few years um and

453
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,120
we have uh yes you can see the

454
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,440
submissions have been uh growing we've

455
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,120
got almost 59 or 60 more than last year

456
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,320
and uh 18 more are accepted papers

457
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,679
then you see the

458
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,679
best paper awards and three honorable

459
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,160
mentioned papers along with the best

460
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,280
early computer researcher award

461
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,200
all right um

462
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,000
moving to the next there we go okay good

463
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,760
uh oh i think there's a missing

464
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,280
yes there it is okay went a little bit

465
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,760
slowly uh so this is the pc

466
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,919
procrastination i mentioned the rebuttal

467
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:30,880
phase

468
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,360
uh so you see down in the middle here uh

469
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,679
zero uh that's the days until the

470
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,520
initial review deadline

471
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,919
and uh you can see the curve it grows

472
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,919
very rapidly uh running up to that

473
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,120
deadline but we have uh 90 plus percent

474
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,679
of the reviews in uh by the by the

475
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,160
deadline uh for the initial rebuttal

476
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,559
phase and then those last few percent uh

477
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,200
tricholon over the subsequent days so

478
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,840
all in all this is uh pretty good i'm

479
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,960
quite happy with uh with this graph here

480
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,039
uh especially with everybody still

481
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,280
dealing with the uh coronavirus pandemic

482
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,320
and being

483
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,640
being at home and so forth

484
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,440
so

485
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,919
many thanks to the pc for uh being so

486
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,039
diligent about about reviews

487
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,160
um

488
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,600
here's our some stats on the scores of

489
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,200
papers that were accepted and not

490
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,520
accepted so in orange those were

491
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,120
rejected and in blue those should be

492
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,200
accepted uh the y axis is a little

493
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,799
messed up here you should divide by

494
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,600
three um this is counting number of

495
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,840
reviews rather than number of papers uh

496
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,080
but you can see the the histogram

497
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,720
uh distribution of the score average

498
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,720
scores for uh the papers

499
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,000
all right so let me look at that for a

500
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,320
moment

501
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,240
uh right and the overall average of all

502
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,080
papers was was right about in the middle

503
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,840
3.43 out of

504
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,240
6

505
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,919
with a minimum of 1 though

506
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,960
all right

507
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
so here's just some fun

508
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,159
qualitative results this is a word cloud

509
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,799
of the words appearing in the submitted

510
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,200
papers so you can see things like

511
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,559
encryption

512
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,799
and security and quantum

513
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,679
and efficient and other things appearing

514
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,919
uh quite commonly and then many other

515
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,280
popular words

516
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,799
as well

517
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,919
and the following is the

518
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,200
word cloud of accepted paper titles

519
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,039
so you'll notice a few things words like

520
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,120
secure and security

521
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,320
and quantum

522
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,799
remain very highly represented in both

523
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,880
submitted and accepted papers

524
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,280
um which is which is no surprise

525
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,360
uh you also see things like the word

526
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,440
encryption is somewhat downgraded it's

527
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,360
less or less represented among the

528
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,280
accepted papers um but phrases like

529
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,400
words like npc

530
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,400
applications black box and sharing

531
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,880
all receive significant upgrades

532
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,120
in their representation in the among the

533
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,440
accepted papers

534
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,640
uh there is one uh distinguishing word

535
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,679
which uh remains the most uh effective

536
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,440
or the most distinguished

537
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,480
and that is in the upper right here it's

538
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,159
schnorr

539
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,640
so this is a very good uh distinguisher

540
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,440
for accepted papers because

541
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,240
all five out of five submitted papers

542
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,640
with schnorr in the title were accepted

543
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,559
that's a 100 acceptor

544
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,200
for uh for those papers and the first

545
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,600
four of them uh again four of them you

546
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,760
may have noticed were in the very first

547
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
session of the conference on monday

548
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,200
morning

549
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,559
so um this this correlation which nor

550
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,240
extends only though to titles uh among

551
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,000
those papers that had snore in the

552
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,720
abstract alone only one out of five of

553
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,960
those uh were accepted so that's a

554
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,240
little bit lower than the uh typical

555
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,720
the the average acceptance rate uh this

556
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,280
year so uh schnoor in the title was very

557
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,240
good snoring the abstract uh only uh not

558
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,080
not nearly as good

559
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,679
so um with these uh trends in mind uh we

560
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,080
are pleased to announce uh next year's

561
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,919
uh best paper and we actually already

562
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,080
know what it is and it's the schnorr's

563
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,840
secure quantum mpc

564
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,640
uh and applications

565
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,360
all right so uh that's everything about

566
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,960
uh paper titles and um we have many

567
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,159
thanks to give uh thank you to vlad for

568
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,240
uh being the general chair uh despite

569
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,080
his protestations that he didn't do any

570
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,400
work uh that's not true he was quite

571
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,200
busy uh to karmit for uh sharing the

572
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,159
workshops uh to bertram antigone and

573
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,799
martian uh for this rum session and

574
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,440
organizing it uh again as they did last

575
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,640
year um kevin and kay

576
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,240
you could see the long list of things

577
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,159
that they uh helped us

578
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,120
with uh in indispensably they were

579
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,960
extremely extremely helpful on all

580
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,679
matter of uh organizing the

581
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,559
conference uh the people at uh springer

582
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,280
uh anna and miriam and uh michelle and

583
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,039
the icr emergency uh pandemic team um

584
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,280
were also very helpful to us in

585
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
organizing the conference

586
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,080
all right so thank you to everybody and

587
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,240
we look forward to the rest of oh i'm

588
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,720
sorry one more slide here um the program

589
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,600
committee yes we have our 58 great

590
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,520
members of the program committee it was

591
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,320
wonderful working with you um this is

592
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
definitely the most fun i've ever had in

593
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,280
an administrative uh capacity for work

594
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,480
this is a really enjoyable um with

595
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,600
everybody uh doing doing so well on the

596
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,200
pc side and to our uh approximately 400

597
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,600
external subreviewers and of course

598
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,080
thanks to the many hundreds of authors

599
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,760
who submitted their work

600
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,159
to make such a great uh program for us

601
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,679
to choose

602
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,240
all right that is all we have uh thank

603
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,600
you very much and we look forward to the

604
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,480
rest of the room session

605
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,039
thank you so much chris

606
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,039
and thank you so much for making this

607
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,679
great program

608
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,960
so let's uh move to the ram session box

609
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,000
we have

610
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,440
kevin fox

611
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,679
kevin

612
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,480
oh kevin you raised your hand

613
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,320
yeah i just want to say to the program

614
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,760
committee um and to uh chris and tall

615
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
that if there's

616
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
anything that we can do to improve the

617
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,679
situation with hot crap please let us

618
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,840
know because while it's difficult to

619
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,679
change the code i think we can set the

620
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,919
direction for the whole community too

621
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,679
it's uh it's a pretty complex piece of

622
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,200
code and the process of running a

623
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,840
committee is really

624
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,679
complicated but uh let's try to keep

625
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,480
improving this thing

626
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,760
thanks kevin definitely

627
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,400
we have to do that

628
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,970
okay so let's move to the next talk um

629
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,520
[Music]

630
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,720
so here's muhammad ready

631
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,279
so he's going to talk on the technical

632
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,000
flaws in ccc white paper

633
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,039
yes uh do you hear me

634
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,400
yes go ahead

635
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,720
cool thank you so welcome everyone and

636
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,600
uh

637
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,000
my talk is on the technical flaws in ccc

638
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
white paper so

639
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,080
uh ccc for your knowledge so it's

640
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,400
confidential computing conservative and

641
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,039
it's consists of uh member organizations

642
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,960
including the giant techs

643
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,360
tech giants this google microsoft huawei

644
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,520
red hat arm so on

645
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,600
and what we would expect out of these

646
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,440
tech giants is a very nice paper and

647
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,919
technically sound and so on so

648
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,039
what comes out of it is uh in october

649
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,279
was a paper named uh

650
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,279
confidential computing deep dive version

651
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,640
1.0

652
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,840
and um a few months later they realized

653
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,840
that it's not so deep it's only abstract

654
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,840
and then they change the title to a

655
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,360
technical analysis of confidential

656
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,080
computing so let's have a deep look at

657
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,840
uh what this is uh consists of the

658
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,400
latest version of this paper consists of

659
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,520
this masterpiece by the ccc tag

660
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,679
uh technical advisory committee and they

661
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,440
conducted a survey

662
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,679
which resulted in this venn diagram

663
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,799
where

664
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,360
the sets of this elements are basically

665
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,600
the definitions of these terms

666
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,200
and um

667
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,720
so you see here the homographic

668
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,960
encryption multiparty computation and

669
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,559
then

670
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,240
an area of trusted execution

671
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,440
environments

672
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,600
including the hardware based as well as

673
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,039
the software-based

674
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,520
and inside the hardware base also some

675
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,360
programmable meaning that they can be

676
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,600
programmed with arbitrary code

677
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,400
and

678
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,960
what we also see here is

679
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,960
set on the tpm which doesn't make much

680
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,720
sense here inside the trusted execution

681
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,320
environments these are two different

682
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,200
completely different technologies and

683
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,520
this was to our surprise a very

684
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,159
surprising thing and when we explored uh

685
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,960
the survey we found that it was kept

686
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,720
confidential and there was not much

687
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,320
information about that

688
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,159
uh it's confidential computing so it

689
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,919
makes sense to have a confidential

690
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,480
survey but uh we went on to see what

691
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,120
definitions might lead to

692
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,480
such a venn diagram and

693
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,000
the definitions claimed by the

694
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,880
confidential computing consortium

695
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,559
included

696
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,000
for example

697
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,760
unlike the term confidential computing

698
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,520
several of the terms used in the diagram

699
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,640
have multiple computing definitions

700
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,520
um

701
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
so let's see how

702
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,480
cc

703
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,080
or confidential computing is uniquely

704
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,880
defined uh it is defined as the by the

705
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,559
confidential operating consortium as the

706
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,399
protection of data in use by performing

707
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,760
complications in the hardware based

708
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
trusted execution environment

709
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,600
and what exactly is this trusted

710
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,120
execution environment this basically

711
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,720
consists of

712
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
an environment that provides a level of

713
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,200
assurance of three properties namely

714
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
data confidentiality data integrity and

715
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,120
code integrity

716
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,000
and

717
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,720
only you have to be a member of the tech

718
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,480
in order to know what exactly is meant

719
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
by this level of assurance so this

720
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,159
informal definition of course is not

721
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,720
unique at all

722
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,799
just to get an idea of another document

723
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,080
of um

724
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,039
confidential computing consortium

725
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,520
confidential computing consortium scope

726
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,960
where they define and actually

727
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,720
contradict this definition which is

728
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
hardware-based execution environment and

729
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,039
here in the same diagram they have

730
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,440
uh definition which is only this

731
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,200
programmable region of the trusted

732
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,120
execution environments as opposed to the

733
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,960
definition which is hardware-based

734
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,360
trusted execution environments

735
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,279
and one major problem with the

736
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,960
definition itself of confidential

737
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,720
computing is that it does not include a

738
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,559
testation at all which is kind of

739
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,679
surprising because this is one major

740
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,080
factor which plays a role in doing

741
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
confidential computing and it doesn't

742
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,840
make much sense to have a confidential

743
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,440
computing or a trusted execution

744
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,279
environment without providing any

745
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,840
guarantees via attestation

746
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,520
so we had um

747
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,600
feedback more than a three more than

748
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,279
three months ago and

749
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,159
there's been no much progress from uh

750
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,039
that

751
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,399
on that and uh an easy fix which seems

752
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,520
to be the

753
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,799
solution is to just change this title to

754
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,720
a new title which is a political

755
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,200
analysis of confidential computing where

756
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,159
they agree that the political dynamics

757
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,320
are more uh

758
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,720
important rather than the scientific

759
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,320
progress

760
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
these are the key references and thank

761
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,600
you very much

762
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,158
for listening

763
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
thank you so much

764
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,320
you didn't run out of time that's great

765
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,010
so next we have um

766
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,120
[Music]

767
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,799
leo

768
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,640
he's going to talk about the moral

769
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,440
character of cryptography work

770
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,159
which is revisited

771
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,720
thank you for the introduction

772
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,679
yep can you hear me

773
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,960
yes

774
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,039
okay thank you

775
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,960
so as you might have figured from the

776
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,840
title uh this talk is heavily inspired

777
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,360
by the

778
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,440
paper that road away put on imprint in

779
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,799
2015 with basically the same title

780
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,200
it's a very interesting uh paper that i

781
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,919
encourage you all to read

782
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,320
which deals not with the techniques of

783
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,960
cryptography but with what they might

784
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,440
imply for the world and in particular

785
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,080
one of the key takeaways of this paper

786
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,840
if the one that they highlighted here in

787
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,520
the abstract

788
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,640
and which

789
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,600
can be summarized as follow in 2015 we

790
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,760
were not doing enough to stop mass

791
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,360
surveillance

792
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
that was six years ago what's the

793
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,120
situation in 2021

794
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,960
in 2021 we have a bit of a situation

795
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,000
apple has decided to set up a new system

796
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,279
in order to

797
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,200
fight against uh pedophiles basically

798
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,320
so

799
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,120
uh

800
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,200
so far so good i want to say the problem

801
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,440
is the approach they are using uh to

802
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,080
reach this goal so all the quotes here

803
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,440
are from their website you can check

804
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,919
their approach is based on detecting

805
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,320
known images basically

806
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,360
your iphone if you own one is going to

807
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,159
check

808
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,600
the pictures that you have and are

809
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,240
planning to upload to icloud and check

810
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,600
if they match uh images in a database

811
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,640
of known bad pictures

812
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
they insist that although this is made

813
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,960
by your own device on your own picture

814
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,519
this is uh privacy preserving because

815
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,519
they have some fancy

816
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,120
protocol with

817
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,440
private intersection set and the secret

818
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,960
sharing but ultimately what it does

819
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,679
is check your phone for pictures that

820
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,120
match a list of bad pictures

821
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,440
what could possibly go wrong you ask

822
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,840
well it's very simple you just replace

823
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,320
the agencies that are currently the

824
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,640
intended recipient of this information

825
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,679
by

826
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,080
some other institution

827
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,880
for instance how long until having this

828
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,200
picture on your iphone in china gets you

829
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,480
into trouble

830
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,919
to put it very bluntly and very

831
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,480
concretely

832
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,279
inspired by this i decided to write a

833
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,039
small tale which is not really a fairy

834
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,799
tale it's more of a cautionary tale it's

835
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,320
the tale of the cryptographer and the

836
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,559
surveillance which is a french word but

837
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,039
also an english word it turns out

838
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,440
so once upon a time there was a company

839
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,679
which i'm going to call ah

840
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:44,720
this

841
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,120
and this company wanted to set up a new

842
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,279
feature in its product

843
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,039
and the only problem alice had with that

844
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,440
was that this feature would have as a

845
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,360
side effect to enable

846
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,720
mass surveillance or at least to have

847
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,799
some turnkey mass surveillance that is

848
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,799
very easy to implement

849
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,519
oh shucks she thought my customers will

850
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,120
never agree to this and i will never be

851
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,799
able to sell my product with this new

852
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,799
feature

853
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,519
however a cryptographer overheard the

854
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,919
sorrow of poor alice and decided to do

855
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:14,960
something

856
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,080
fear or not

857
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,159
with privacy preserving techniques it

858
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,120
won't be that bad for your customers

859
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,880
and alice was very happy because not

860
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,360
that bad is all she needed

861
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,679
so she cheered and cheered and was

862
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,679
joined by other voices which were not

863
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,279
invited a priory

864
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,080
it was all the words dictators who now

865
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,279
have

866
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,600
the ability to just ask alice to do turn

867
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,200
the key

868
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,840
off her surveillance apparatus and if

869
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,000
she disagrees they can just force her

870
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,159
through

871
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,960
taking her out of their own market

872
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,799
i believe we are at the crossroads in

873
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,640
cryptography at the moment

874
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,480
cryptography at large

875
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,279
we can do actual privacy preserving

876
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,320
things

877
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,360
which in my opinion uh may be our last

878
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,519
hope to have steal some

879
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,799
privacy

880
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,879
in the modern days

881
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,199
or we can be in the situation which i am

882
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,079
calling privacy invasion enabling

883
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,760
it's the case where cryptographic

884
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,719
techniques are used to enable more

885
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,679
invasion of privacy by giving them a

886
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,839
veneer of respectability

887
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,000
or by allowing techniques

888
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
of the door in the face style so if you

889
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,159
don't know what door in the face is it's

890
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,399
when you want to obtain 10 so you ask

891
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,440
for 100

892
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,960
the question is what we do as a

893
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,159
community

894
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,480
so should we celebrate the elegance of

895
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,879
the system that is set up by apple with

896
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,800
all the private intersection set and

897
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,480
secret sharing

898
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,480
and of the systems that will follow

899
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,760
because i don't think apple is the only

900
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,079
one who is going to do such a thing

901
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,879
or should we strongly condemn it

902
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,119
because the way i see it six years ago

903
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,040
or rogue away asked asked a very good

904
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,280
question is our work good

905
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,040
enough

906
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,960
nowadays i think we need to ask

907
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,680
ourselves if some cryptography work is

908
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,720
good

909
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,118
at all

910
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,680
i believe that we as a community must be

911
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,599
very careful with the practical impact

912
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,240
of our work is it privacy preserving

913
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,560
or privacy invasion enabling it's really

914
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,079
not the same thing

915
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,640
and we must be ready to loudly condemn

916
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,040
harmful usage of the techniques

917
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,880
we develop for instance in the apple

918
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,960
system in the specific case of the apple

919
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,200
system it's quite easy you can just go

920
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,599
and sign the petition that nadim kobasi

921
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,839
set up extremely quickly and extremely

922
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,200
efficiently so thanks to him

923
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,560
and just click on this link and if you

924
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,920
have a github account you will be able

925
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,440
to sign very quickly

926
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,079
to condemn the apple system

927
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,599
and that's it for me thank you very much

928
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,320
thank you so much leo

929
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,640
so um now we're gonna have the jeopardy

930
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,480
so but now

931
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,800
we can start

932
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,920
we don't hear you if you're talking

933
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,000
earthrim is muted

934
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,440
yes

935
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,839
button

936
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,960
we can think him offline oh

937
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,000
okay

938
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,560
oh his system crashed

939
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,240
yes

940
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,920
we can play without the horse it does

941
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,440
happen

942
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,839
so

943
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,040
maybe we can take this opportunity to

944
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,119
say hello to tal malkin because i think

945
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,880
she has joined now

946
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
uh and because earlier she wasn't there

947
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,320
so

948
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,040
yeah i'm so sorry i missed it but you

949
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,119
know what i was just telling chris at

950
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,520
least i made it for jeopardy

951
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,560
uh

952
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,240
yeah i don't understand it's not even a

953
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,640
time zone issue it's just i thought it

954
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,760
said 6 p.m and i showed up at 6 p.m and

955
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,800
then it turned out to be 5 30. but talia

956
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,119
you're not even playing jeopardy

957
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,200
i can watch i remember it from last year

958
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,359
i love good health here but yeah i

959
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,960
wanted to be in the beginning i'm really

960
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
sorry everyone but i'm you know this is

961
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,119
why you need a reliable culture like

962
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,480
chris

963
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,240
so

964
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,000
is it still my turn can you hear me now

965
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,760
sorry myself

966
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,000
we'll uh we'll hand over to you

967
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,040
can you see this chat screen

968
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,880
yes yes

969
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,960
okay that's that's good news finally uh

970
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,119
very good so thank you to the jeopardy

971
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,720
uh welcome to the jeopardy of this

972
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,640
year's crypto we have played this last

973
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,240
year so you some of you might have

974
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,400
remembered uh i give a very quick

975
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,320
interview introduction to what japanese

976
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,280
and how how to play this game um we have

977
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,560
a panel again

978
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,480
but this time also the audience might be

979
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,359
involved if they want to so so carefully

980
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,000
pay attention to this so jeopardy game

981
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,079
looks like this there's a there's a

982
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,760
table with um

983
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,640
in this case 30 doors numbered one to

984
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,960
500 in multiple categories so here we

985
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,160
see five categories we have uh three

986
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,560
teams playing against each other each

987
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,240
team made of two

988
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,520
candidates

989
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,000
what they will do is to ask me to open

990
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,240
one of these doors behind one of these

991
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,320
doors behind all of these doors are

992
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,880
specific terms depicted with

993
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,520
with an image or something like this and

994
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,680
the job is to guess which chambers might

995
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,119
be this will be all related to

996
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,000
cryptography um the trick with jeopardy

997
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,560
playing is that one shall not just say

998
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,640
the term and has to guess the term right

999
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,320
but one has to formulate it as a

1000
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,560
question

1001
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,680
um with this uh we go to introduce the

1002
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,920
teams we have team three very powerful

1003
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,280
teams this year

1004
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,520
uh even more powerful no i don't compare

1005
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,079
it to last year um we have three very

1006
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,000
powerful teams uh team anatolia on the

1007
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,880
left-hand side anna maria and stefano we

1008
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,839
have the team bees uh jal and marcel in

1009
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,160
the middle and we have tame the team

1010
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,800
carnival melons elaine and repo

1011
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,200
we have this time as i mentioned earlier

1012
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,680
uh the option that the audience plays

1013
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,240
along so it's not only the the

1014
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,320
six panelists playing against each other

1015
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,640
but also the audience can play however

1016
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,599
they do not play against the panelists

1017
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,760
they play kind of settle separately but

1018
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,200
we do count

1019
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,359
the the scores and we can later

1020
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,920
hopefully if we do the evaluation fast

1021
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,960
enough we connect we can announce who is

1022
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,319
who is the winner

1023
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,319
um here

1024
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,839

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,839
so let's go for com schemes 300

1072
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,599
common screens 300 a very good shots

1073
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,640
for those playing at home that are not

1074
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,119
the panelists c300 is the door you need

1075
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,960
to click on and

1076
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,520

1077
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,240
martin i need your help to tell me who

1078
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,000
raises the hand of the panelists

1079
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,880
so far i don't see any

1080
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,839
what's wrong with these

1081
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:47,119
panelists what's wrong with this quote

1082
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,720
what's wrong with the students if 100 of

1083
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,680
them fail an exam

1084
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,560
so this is a

1085
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,359
from a standard document that defines a

1086
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,400
common scheme and it is a

1087
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,400
eland

scheme

1091

1092
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,040
so can can we get a hint or something or

1093

1125
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,480
by the way if you're never watching this

1126
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,760
so this is the e200

can i ask if the audience plays we also

1129
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,400
have to formulate it as a question like

1130

if i just submitted ds on the last one

1131

team of four people evaluating this and

1133
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,839
it is up to them to do this uh i

1134
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,680
wouldn't assume this necessarily that

1135
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,800
they will not in the future okay

1136
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,880
i'm in the lucky position i will not

1137
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,640
evaluate that the whole point of

1138
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,560
jeopardy is to answer in the form of a

1139

patrick

1192
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,240
this is not the right question i open

1193
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,240
the hand

1194
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,119
this would be the most cited paper of

1195
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,480
this person according to google

1196
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,559
statistics marcel is your hand still

1197
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,160
apple again sorry

1198
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,839
stefano

1199
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,920
well i can never pronounce her name uh

1200
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,400
so i'm gonna offend her but who is uh

1201
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,079
ingrid

1202
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,400
um

1203
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,839
don't try don't try don't write them

1204
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,760
okay okay it's not correct it's not

1205
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,520
correct okay

1206
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,839
raise your lower your hand please okay

1207
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,040
well i guess i bought this one

1208
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,359
no myself

1209
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,119
uh well since guessing doesn't cost

1210
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,079
anything who is elizabeth oswalt

1211
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,400
it's a wonderful guess but unfortunately

1212
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,520
incorrect

1213
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,060
this is david nakash

[Music]

1215
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,119
that must be this here

1216
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,720
who picks this time

1217
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,160
uh

1218
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,720
we'll have to continue with the rest of

1219
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,359
the rum session so

1220
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,839
okay so take this

1221
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:22,400
we'll continue with jeopardy uh

1222
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,640
in the next break so hopefully you can

1223
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,119
all practice and and

1224
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,559
brush up on your history because uh well

1225
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:36,240
um so the next talk is uh by melton

1226
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,599
update from 2021 so welcome

1227

we can hear you but we well we can hear

1234
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,040
you but we can't see your screen yet if

1235
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,079
that was the intention

1236
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,440
yes now we can see it please go ahead

1237
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,040
uh

1238
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,200
welcome

1239
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,800
we can hear clicking but we can't hear

1240
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,839
you speak

1241
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:45,400
and now you're muted

1242
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,400
okay i'm gonna change my

1243
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,480
how about now

1244
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,079
yes excellent

1245
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,000
okay sorry about that

1246
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,920
so

1247
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,880
uh let me go back yeah so i'm going to

1248
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,040
talk about three projects

1249
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,200
and the first project is the crypto

1250
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,160
publication review uh project this is a

1251
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,800
new project is initiated

1252
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,119
to periodically review and maintain its

1253
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,119
standards and guidelines

1254
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,920
and the review process usually includes

1255
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,240
an internal and external reviewers and

1256
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,760
is also supported by uh public comments

1257
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,000
and the decision after the review can

1258
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,599
either be reaffirm update revise convert

1259
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,400
or withdraw the standard and the first

1260
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,200
standard that is going over the rev

1261
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,200
that we are reviewing is the advanced

1262
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,359
encryption standard which was written 20

1263
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,559
years ago

1264
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,359
and to sp support this review we have

1265
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:54,880
published

1266
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,800
uh and report as well and some other

1267
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,000
publications that are going um

1268
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,760
that under review are

1269
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,680
block cipher modes of operations

1270
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,440
statistical randomness suit and uh hmac

1271
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,400
standard as well

1272
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,119
and

1273
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,000
um

1274
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,319
and it's also this is decided to

1275
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,040
withdraw some of the early pki standards

1276
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,480
as well

1277
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,240
okay the second project i'm going to

1278
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,760
talk about is the lightweight

1279
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,520
cryptography project

1280
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,319
and

1281
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,079
currently we are in the third round of

1282
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,040
this project and this uh in march nest

1283
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,480
announced

1284
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,880
10 finalists among

1285
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,280
32 second-round candidates

1286
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,599
10 of these were selected as finalists

1287
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,040
and

1288
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,520
we have uh published a report to explain

1289
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,520
the status

1290
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,200
selection process

1291
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,480
we have aad and hashing algorithms five

1292
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,720
five of these finalists support aad and

1293
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,960
the remaining five supports aad and

1294
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,000
hashing

1295
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,760
and if you want to provide feedback on

1296
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,440
the security and the performance of

1297
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,680
these finalists uh you

1298
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,680
can use the uh public lwc forum

1299
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,920
and as next steps of this

1300
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,880
public

1301
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,079
process uh we have a workshop coming up

1302
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,880
in spring

1303
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,040
2022 and couple of months after the

1304
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,480
workshop we're planning to have

1305
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,440
have

1306
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,040
announced of a winner of the

1307
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,119
standardization process

1308
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,200
and the third project that i'm going to

1309
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,359
talk about uh is the post quantum

1310
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,599
cryptography project it is also

1311
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,640
currently in the third round of analysis

1312
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,040
and this submissions are categorized

1313
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,280
into two groups the eight seven

1314
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,520
finalists and the alternates

1315
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,440
the finalists are the algorithms that

1316
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,880
are most likely to be uh ready for

1317
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,319
standardization at the end of round

1318
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:51,520
three and the alternatives uh candidates

1319
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,240
are also interesting but they will be

1320
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,000
probably be

1321
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,680
as

1322
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,079
need one more round for analysis and the

1323
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,720
expectation is to select a small number

1324
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,000
of candidates fi if just to be

1325
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
standardized at the end of

1326
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,319
round three and all the information is

1327
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,960
available in the website and the

1328
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,680
announcements are in the pub a pqc forum

1329
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,640
as well

1330
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,079
and this is the timeline of the process

1331
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,040
uh

1332
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,119
so soon this will begin the decision

1333
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,040
process to select the algorithms to

1334
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,680
standardize and then this team will work

1335
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,920
with the design uh teams to create

1336
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,480
drafts which which will be out for

1337
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,559
public comments and this will probably

1338
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,359
take a year or two before uh the first

1339
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,160
uh post quantum cryptography standards

1340
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,040
are fully finalized and published

1341
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,599
and at the same time

1342
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,839
this team will be evaluating uh the

1343
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,319
alternates candidates at the fourth uh

1344
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,640
round and additionally nist is uh

1345
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,799
planning to issue another call for

1346
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:59,200
proposal with a for additional post

1347
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,440
quantum digital signature schemes uh

1348
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,359
with a smaller scope

1349
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:06,000
and more analysis uh details will be

1350
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,960
available in the pqc forum and uh yeah

1351
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,280
thank you for your attention and

1352
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,040
we really appreciate everybody who

1353
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,359
contributes to these projects

1354
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,760
thanks martin

1355
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,359
okay thank you very much thank you very

1359
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,520
next up is felix eggerman successfully

1360
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,680
failing the crossword puzzle so you

1361
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,359
might have noticed there's a crossword

1362
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:32,240
and

1363
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,480
something funny happened there so felix

1364
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,559
please go ahead

1365
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,680
hi uh i suppose you see the screen and

1366
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,040
hear me uh yes yes it's both okay okay

1367
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,599
yeah so i'll tell you how to

1368
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,799
successfully fail the crypto 2021

1369
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,119
crossword puzzle

1370
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,200
so it all started with

1371
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,920
attending yesterday is a view party and

1372
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,520
delicious

1373
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,200
strawberries

1374
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,040
and in the breaks we of course

1375
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,040
sit sit together and discuss the

1376
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,599
old crossword puzzle so whatever you see

1377
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,599
here is no longer applicable because

1378
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,480
there is a new one check it out

1379
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,280
so we sat together and puzzled about the

1380
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,280
clues and tried to fill out the words

1381
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,240
but

1382
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,319
come on solving it honestly is not the

1383
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,799
way to go but we can also look behind

1384
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,480
the scenes and inspect what the

1385
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,319
websocket is doing

1386
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:29,440
uh

1387
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,599
in itself so

1388
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,839
pulling up a browser we see that it

1389
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:35,680
connects to some websocket with some

1390
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,359
authentication

1391
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,520
and sends a session and then we have to

1392
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,200
reply 40

1393
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,160
and then we get a description of the

1394
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,440
puzzle and our state and whoever guesses

1395
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,599
something correctly or wrongly

1396
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,160
we get an update about that

1397
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,280
so

1398
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,040
what could we do is we could just

1399
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,000
connect to that programmatically and not

1400
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,640
assume the the browser

1401
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,040
connect to the socket send 40 because

1402
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,880
that's important to to get the whole

1403
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,760
thing going uh then receive

1404
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,640
a bit

1405
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,480
uh in the beginning because

1406
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,119
we need to just discard the

1407
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,040
description of the puzzle and then we

1408
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,160
can send our guess and we get a result

1409
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,119
if the guess is correct or not so

1410
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,400
the the id number 58 was the half a fly

1411
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,640
which was the city fly

1412
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,960
and

1413
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,680
the result was that the guess is correct

1414
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,720
so

1415
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,040
now we have programmatic access to the

1416
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,559
oracle to return correct um

1417
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:40,880
correct words or wrong guesses

1418
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,640
but then

1419
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,319
we did a back of the envelope

1420
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:48,240
calculation and see saw like hmm

1421
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,599
for three

1422
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:52,079
letter for three character words that

1423
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,799
might make sense and it's about 17 000

1424
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,839
guesses that will take about 10 minutes

1425
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:01,280
let's try it out if it works so

1426
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,240
i wrote a small script to check all

1427
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,720
three letter permutations

1428
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,200
in a nested loop then i built the

1429
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,599
three-letter word from it printed it and

1430
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:12,400
then

1431
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,200
sent the gas off and checked if the

1432
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,640
received thing

1433
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,359
uh contains true because i wasn't even

1434
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,559
bothering parsing the the json which

1435
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,079
came back

1436
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,640
and if true is included then i obviously

1437
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,000
found the gas and then i let it running

1438
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,319
and

1439
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,799
that happened

1440
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,400
so

1441
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,760
the number of correct guesses just

1442
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,079
iterated upwards

1443
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,599
and then

1444
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,359
i was kind of

1445
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:51,920
weirdly suspicious what was happening

1446
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,839
and i looked at my code again

1447
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:57,520
um and

1448
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,040
looking at it further i recognized that

1449
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,759
i made a bug

1450
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,040
so

1451
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,440
i obviously sent the same

1452
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,880
correct guess

1453
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,799
all the time instead of iterating over

1454
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,480
my words

1455
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,599
so what i did i sent a whole bunch of

1456
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,839
flies to the server

1457
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,880
and they all got counted

1458
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,920
so

1459
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,119
that

1460
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:24,960
then resulted in

1461
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,040
getting

1462
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,400
2021 correct guesses

1463
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,400
but the incorrect ones were looking a

1464
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,760
bit off so those are just rookie numbers

1465
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,079
we have to get them higher to next even

1466
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,440
number so now that's fixed

1467
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,280
and that's all fun

1468
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,520
until you get banned

1469
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,960
for

1470
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,760
like

1471
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,240
not playing along the rules and the main

1472
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,200
takeaways of this small project is that

1473
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,599
the back of the envelope estimations may

1474
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,400
not help you at all because you may find

1475
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,400
something completely different the

1476
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,319
python websocket client library is

1477
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,520
amazing

1478
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,359
send 40

1479
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,440
and make the most of the fading

1480
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,400
strawberry season because they won't be

1481
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,799
around for much longer

1482
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:13,599
and special thanks to the au group for

1483
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,359
all the material used for this

1484
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:16,559
presentation and the amazing

1485
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:17,920
strawberries

1486
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,400
to ray for the puzzle and especially for

1487
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,000
kevin for creating the whole software um

1488
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,240
and then patching it like

1489
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,520
10 minutes after the thing happened so

1490
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:33,200
thanks a lot and have fun

1491
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,440
thank you very much that was uh

1492
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,680
enlightening

1493
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,559
so

1494
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,839
that was the point of it uh

1495
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:44,079
so i hope uh kay and kevin weren't too

1496
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,000
uh

1497
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,200
upset by the uh counting

1498
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,039
kay gets none of the blame for this the

1499
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,599
blame goes to you

1500
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:56,960
it's not really blame it's just fun

1501
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,240
and it was

1502
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:02,759
but yeah it definitely is kevin's fault

1503
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,799
so the next talk is by eleci on

1504
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:15,599
impossibility result for transactions v

1505
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,760
mechanisms i suppose

1506
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,640
so elaine please take it away

1507
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,920
[Music]

1508
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,799
and

1509
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,119
i guess my student hau chang he cannot

1510
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:26,960
be here today because he just arrived in

1511
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,400
the us and he's a pretty badly jet lag

1512
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,240
i'm going to tell you about uh exciting

1513
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,640
mechanism design problem transaction fee

1514
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,119
mechanisms

1515
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,200
so you know we are familiar with the

1516
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,520
scenario and

1517
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,520
every user has some transaction the

1518
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,440
transaction will pay some fee but the

1519
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,559
block size is finite so that's why we

1520
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,000
need to run an option here

1521
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:55,920
and

1522
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,000
this problem turns out to be technically

1523
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,079
fascinating because

1524
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,119
the classical mechanisms all fail uh

1525
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,960
here's an example so like

1526
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,839
the generalized second price option is

1527
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:09,440
like the golden standard in the

1528
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,839
classical mechanism design literature

1529
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:13,760
but it just completely fails here so

1530
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,960
imagine

1531
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,119
in this case we want to confirm four

1532
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,559
transactions

1533
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:20,960
but they pay the fifth price

1534
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,559
and the reason why it doesn't work is

1535
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,480
because the miner is selfish and it can

1536
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,480
just inject a big transaction

1537
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,240
whose price is in between the fourth and

1538
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,039
the fifth and this will allow the miner

1539
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:32,799
to make more revenue

1540
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:34,880
and in the classical mechanism design

1541
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,640
literature typically we would just trust

1542
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,480
the auctioneer but here you know even

1543
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,520
the miner can be selfish

1544
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,960
so that's why we need to rethink

1545
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,200
making and the first question we want to

1546
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,880
ask is you know what is the dream

1547
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,960
transaction fee mechanism

1548
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,359
and there's a line of work previously on

1549
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,880
this and they basically raised the

1550
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,680
following set of

1551
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,160
nice properties we want to have

1552
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,000
first we want to have user incentive

1553
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,200
compatibility meaning the user's best

1554
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,839
strategy is to bid truthfully

1555
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,440
we also want to have minor incentive

1556
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,440
compatibility meaning the miner's

1557
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,839
dominant strategy is to play by the book

1558
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:16,000
uh we also want to have side contract

1559
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,400
proofness meaning if the miner colludes

1560
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,880
with up to c users then they also don't

1561
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,960
have any incentive to deviate from the

1562
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,400
honest uh behavior

1563
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,160
so

1564
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,079
tim rothgarden raised

1565
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:31,760
an interesting open question can we

1566
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,920
actually have such a dream transaction

1567
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,760
fee mechanism satisfying all these

1568
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,200
properties

1569
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,680
and the interesting thing is so

1570
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,599
even though there have been several

1571
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,119
various papers that looked at this

1572
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,119
problem none of them could achieve all

1573
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,960
these three properties at the same time

1574
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,119
and the closest we have come to is

1575
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,400
actually ethereum's

1576
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,760
eip1559 and this was like rolled out a

1577
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,160
couple weeks ago and tim rousgarden

1578
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,480
proved that if the block size is

1579
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,079
infinite then ethereum cip 1559 indeed

1580
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,160
satisfies all of these three properties

1581
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,760
but in reality you know the block size

1582
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,160
is finite and there can be congestion so

1583
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,440
it fails

1584
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,280
in that sense

1585
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,640
so we

1586
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,839
prove

1587
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:15,920
that you know unfortunately if you want

1588
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,680
all of these three properties

1589
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,680
it's actually impossible

1590
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,720
under finite block size assumption

1591
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,359
um and this you know asks

1592
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:26,480
asks us

1593
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,520
to think

1594
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,079
is there any way to relax the incentive

1595
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:32,480
compatibility notion to circumvent this

1596
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,400
impossibility and we show that there are

1597
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,319
some meaningful relaxations maybe you

1598
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,000
know we can get around

1599
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,520
the same possibility

1600
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,440
and interestingly this relaxation kind

1601
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,760
of makes use of this repeated nature of

1602
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,480
the

1603
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,440
transaction key mechanism and finally

1604
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,599
and you know transaction fee mechanism

1605
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:50,880
actually has

1606
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,799
interesting new elements

1607
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,880
that were not found in classical

1608
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,920
mechanisms like like ethereums 15 59 has

1609
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,319
a new rule called the beru and we were

1610
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:02,000
able to actually explain why the

1611
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,760
existence of these new elements are

1612
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,960
necessary

1613
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,039
you know from a theoretical perspective

1614
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,760
and so if you are interested our paper

1615
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,559
hopefully will be on e-print soon and

1616
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,559
this is an exciting area with lots of

1617
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,359
open questions and and

1618
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:19,440
i'm pretty excited about this space

1619
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,839
thank you

1620
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,079
thank you very much indeed

1621
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:24,880
um

1622
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,520
so also for questions of course also for

1623
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,359
a rob session people can ask

1624
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:32,558
serious questions on the

1625
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,160
zoolab even though

1626
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,559
there might be jokes there as well but

1627
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,160
also serious questions can be asked

1628
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,119
there

1629
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:40,720
so next up is

1630
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,240
david heath together with the uh

1631
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,640
probably winner of the best joke of uh

1632
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,079
the room session

1633
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,440
uh so one hot garlic david take it away

1634
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,119
uh thank you so unfortunately i do have

1635
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:54,880
to disappoint anybody this is not a joke

1636
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,119
this is uh some serious thing but

1637
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,440
uh we wanted to take the opportunity uh

1638
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,160
vlad and me to to share with you some

1639
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,680
research that we think is very very

1640
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,079
exciting and that will be appearing at

1641
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,680
ccs uh later this year uh and so you

1642
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,520
know to pique your interest the idea is

1643
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,039
that we have found some new uh gates for

1644
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:17,279
garbled circuits that are more efficient

1645
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,960
and so we think this is very exciting

1646
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,000
and

1647
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,679
a bit surprising that anything is

1648
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,439
possible like this

1649
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:24,799
um so

1650
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,799
so of course garbled circuits uh

1651
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:29,120
traditionally you build garbled circuits

1652
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,600
and they consist of and and xor gates

1653
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,839
and this is a complete basis so what do

1654
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:35,920
i mean by new gates well of course there

1655
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,759
are some functions that if you turn them

1656
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,600
into a bunch of van and xor gates it

1657
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,439
might not be so cheap

1658
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:43,198
so the question is are there some other

1659
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:44,880
gates are there some other functions we

1660
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,880
can compute using some cryptotechnical

1661
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,120
techniques that still make sense for

1662
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,799
garbled circuits

1663
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,560
and are you know cheaper than just

1664
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,319
blowing everything down to n's and xors

1665
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,000
and we happen to find one that turns out

1666
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,479
to be very flexible uh and so i'm going

1667
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:01,679
to show it to you it's going to look

1668
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,000
very very niche and not useful probably

1669
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,679
at first glance but i i promise that

1670
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,600
this is quite powerful actually and very

1671
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,439
very useful

1672
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:11,759
so what this operation is saying is that

1673
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:14,238
uh we're taking in two bit strings

1674
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:15,439
a and b

1675
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:17,520
and we are computing what we call the

1676
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,238
one hot outer product of a and b okay so

1677
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,920
what is this these are two

1678
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,158
bit strings again and it computes a bit

1679
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:25,439
and matrix

1680
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:27,359
that is zero everywhere

1681
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:28,640
except for

1682
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,799
in the eighth row if you interpret a as

1683
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:34,319
a number the eighth row is the vector b

1684
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:35,920
okay so this is the one hot outer

1685
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,640
product of a and b

1686
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,319
and we were able to compute this very

1687
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,719
very efficiently if the garbled circuit

1688
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,238
evaluator

1689
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:46,479
happens to know in clear text

1690
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:49,279
the value a okay so this is again it

1691
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:50,960
sounds very niche what could this be

1692
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,238
useful for

1693
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:53,359
um

1694
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,280
but before i show you you know how this

1695
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,880
might be useful i just want to say some

1696
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,560
interesting things about it so first of

1697
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,360
all

1698
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,159
in order to to build this this garbled

1699
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:05,040
gadget uh we had to use some tricks that

1700
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,679
are similar to uh research coming out of

1701
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,760
the space of function secret sharing and

1702
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,040
distributed point functions which we

1703
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,600
think is at least very curious uh that

1704
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,880
there is some application of these

1705
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,239
techniques in the space of garbled

1706
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:17,520
circuits

1707
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,120
again this is

1708
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,040
using far less communication than if we

1709
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,880
were to build this matrix using and xor

1710
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:23,920
gates

1711
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,360
and this is still a garbling scheme we

1712
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,880
haven't introduced new

1713
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,480
rounds of interaction or anything like

1714
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,679
that

1715
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:30,800
and again

1716
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,719
this improves a lot of interesting

1717
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:34,080
applications that you might be

1718
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,760
interested in

1719
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,480
um so so how do you actually build stuff

1720
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,920
out of this thing

1721
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,760
well i mean again i'm just mostly here

1722
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:42,960
to try to pique your interest but i want

1723
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,120
to give you at least a high level idea

1724
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,920
what what you can do with this thing

1725
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,960
so the idea is again we need to we need

1726
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,800
the evaluator the garbled circuit

1727
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,159
evaluator to know this this bit vector a

1728
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,640
which is restrictive but what we can do

1729
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,360
is we can res we can reveal

1730
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,280
certain internal values to the evaluator

1731
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,679
so long as that value is masked by some

1732
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,000
uniform bit mask perhaps right so i can

1733
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,760
i can't reveal a to the evaluator but i

1734
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,840
can reveal a plus alpha for uniform

1735
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,960
alpha

1736
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,280
now we can use our gate

1737
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,960
and the key trick here is that this one

1738
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,480
hot encoding uh is in in a sense

1739
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,560
fully homomorphic and what i mean by

1740
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,800
that is that basically you can use the

1741
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,360
truth table for any function you like

1742
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,800
so you can use the truth table for any

1743
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,800
function you like and using only linear

1744
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,840
operations you can obtain f of a plus

1745
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,159
alpha so this is like a very powerful

1746
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:37,360
thing that you're able to do that you

1747
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,600
can apply any function you like to this

1748
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,560
to this

1749
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,360
projected out one hot encoding

1750
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,679
uh outer product right

1751
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:47,440
and then from here okay we've introduced

1752
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,239
this mask but in certain cases we can re

1753
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,880
remove the mask using simple algebra and

1754
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,400
this allows us to compute things more

1755
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,600
quickly than we would have been able to

1756
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,960
otherwise

1757
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,960
so the simplest way way you can use this

1758
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,280
thing is to construct the the true outer

1759
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,800
product of two bit vectors not the one

1760
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,280
hot outer product or one where a is not

1761
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,719
known but you can construct the true

1762
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:09,199
outer product and it turns out very

1763
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,960
interestingly this is kind of a strict

1764
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,320
generalization of the half gates

1765
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,920
technique which until very recently was

1766
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,000
the state-of-the-art garbled circuit

1767
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,120
technique

1768
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,040
and it also improves a number of other

1769
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,520
functions perhaps most interestingly it

1770
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,280
improves the multiplication of numbers

1771
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,960
within garbled circuits

1772
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,640
and so again i just wanted to pique your

1773
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,640
interest and you know we think this is

1774
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,920
really exciting research so thank you

1775
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,719
very much for listening

1776
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,120
thank you this

1777
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,159
uh is

1778
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:37,840
picking interest

1779
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,800
um

1780
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,560
so the next and final talk of this

1781
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,840
session is by lewis randall uh nist

1782
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,560
crypto exploratory projects

1783
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,679
back

1784
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:49,690
threshold

1785
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:51,440
[Music]

1786
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,800
and masking

1787
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,800
so please go ahead

1788
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,640
hello can you hear me

1789
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,840
yes

1790
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,159
okay great indeed so um i'm with the

1791
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,760
crypto group at nist as a contractor

1792
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,000
from strategia and i'll take his five

1793
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,560
minutes to give some notes on uh some of

1794
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,120
our exploratory projects that missed

1795
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,840
which are not in stages of competition

1796
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,320
uh as other projects you've heard about

1797
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,080
but they are in stages where they would

1798
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,880
greatly benefit from getting community

1799
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,080
feedback

1800
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,679
so let me just start by defining the

1801
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:24,239
scope here so uh you might consider here

1802
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:27,040
these simple strawberries as

1803
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,040
uh some elementary building blocks of

1804
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,520
crypto so like ciphers like aes hash

1805
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,000
functions like the sha family

1806
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,440
signatures

1807
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,679
like rsa and encryption schemes and

1808
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,159
prngs this is the typical fo this is the

1809
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:43,199
traditional focus of of nist in terms of

1810
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:44,480
standardization

1811
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,840
now the difficulty is that in the

1812
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:46,719
current

1813
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:48,960
real world we're increasingly needing to

1814
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,719
look at something more like a fruit

1815
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,480
salad so maybe you want to have your

1816
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,000
strawberry with chocolate or without

1817
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,920
chocolate or you you might have to

1818
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,840
combine other fruits

1819
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,000
so this leads us to seeing what should

1820
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,320
we do about higher level techniques

1821
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,960
sometimes with some special features in

1822
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,800
it these are uh techniques that are

1823
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,800
increasingly pertinent they have many

1824
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,800
trade-offs so often it's it's more

1825
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,080
difficult to choose what should be

1826
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,679
standardized or not and they raise

1827
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,840
issues about composability in others so

1828
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,120
these recent projects i want to talk

1829
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,280
about aim to develop reference material

1830
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,480
and prepare future guidance and

1831
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,960
hopefully in the near future we'll we'll

1832
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,880
actually be more closely looking at

1833
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,239
standardization

1834
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:27,840
so the first project would be

1835
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,600
privacy-enhancing cryptography this

1836
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,199
intends to accompany the progress of

1837
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,199
emerging pec tools so i'm using here

1838
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:35,040
pack tools as an umbrella term that

1839
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,280
encompasses many techniques things

1840
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,199
general like general things like secure

1841
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,440
multi-party computation other popular

1842
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,120
techniques like zero knowledge groups

1843
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,520
and normal morph encryption and many

1844
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,679
others some of which might be your

1845
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,760
favorite ones

1846
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:50,480
so

1847
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,480
this project intends to evaluate the

1848
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,320
potential for standardization of the

1849
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,560
spec tools in particular taking this

1850
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,920
approach of developing reference

1851
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,000
material that can support

1852
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,760
their use and also assess their

1853
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,080
potential for for standardization some

1854
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,840
of our developing resources they are

1855
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,440
online

1856
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,360
include

1857
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,840
a report on peck which we are developing

1858
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,520
and we hope to have a draft out for

1859
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,719
public comments in late 2021 uh we'll

1860
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:18,719
also have a second draft of a back use

1861
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,400
case suite which is a document that

1862
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,159
tries to look more at a

1863
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:24,640
at an applicational perspective

1864
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,719
we've been hosting a series of talks on

1865
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:29,040
pack tools we'll continue to do this

1866
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,600
this year and the next and so forth that

1867
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,120
look at pac tools and how they can be

1868
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,520
used for privacy and public auditability

1869
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,880
and hopefully around 2022 2023 we may

1870
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,159
have a workshop uh unpack japanese

1871
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:44,080
okay another project is the multi-party

1872
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,000
threshold cryptography and it intends to

1873
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,760
challenge this conventional wisdom that

1874
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,040
a a single bad apple can ruin

1875
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,120
your day so when we consider the

1876
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,440
threshold approach we can actually have

1877
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,120
this setting where a good strawberry is

1878
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,960
enough to save your day even if some of

1879
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,360
the strawberries are not that good

1880
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,960
a bonus point here is that we can

1881
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,840
actually do this in a in a provable

1882
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,000
sense um some caveats that i haven't

1883
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,360
included in slides that actually

1884
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,280
sometimes you need the majority of good

1885
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,719
strawberries or sometimes even a

1886
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:14,880
two-star majority of good strawberries

1887
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,480
but the point is that you can withstand

1888
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,440
some some bad strawberries in your skin

1889
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,000
so this project intends to look at how

1890
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,159
to distribute trust in the operation of

1891
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:27,360
cryptographic primitives uh that need to

1892
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,199
have some secret key that should not be

1893
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:31,440
anywhere at any given point in time

1894
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,400
our current focus is are

1895
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,880
different distinct focuses include these

1896
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,600
five primitives so each cdsa fbsa and

1897
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,480
rsa signatures also rsa key generation

1898
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,880
and aes and we want to move towards

1899
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,480
developing guidelines for threshold

1900
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,560
schemes for these primitives

1901
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,320
we've had in the past two years two

1902
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,480
reports and two workshops and we

1903
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,880
currently have a call for feedback until

1904
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,040
september 13th so we would very much

1905
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,880
welcome your feedback and based on this

1906
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,120
feedback we will then put out a

1907
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,040
another report that will actually

1908
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,520
specify concrete criteria let me take 30

1909
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,199
seconds to

1910
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,800
mention here three topics on this call

1911
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,320
for criteria one of them is

1912
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,320
interchangeability we would like to have

1913
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,000
feedback on

1914
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,560
uh probabilistic versus deterministic

1915
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,840
signatures because this is a problem

1916
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,480
that arises in threshold signatures

1917
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,280
we would like to have feedback on what

1918
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,280
is the appropriate threshold no pun

1919
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,040
intended here

1920
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,199
to accept something that would be secure

1921
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:30,960
against adaptive corruptions and we

1922
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,480
would also like to have feedback on

1923
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,560
games and the ideal functionalities for

1924
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,159
this case and finally as a third project

1925
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:41,120
uh masked circuits this is a spin-off of

1926
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,800
our old threshold cryptography project

1927
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,239
so it kind of consists there is a

1928
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,960
threshold approach in single devices and

1929
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,560
masking has a potential to improve the

1930
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,199
resistance to certain side channel packs

1931
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,360
in hardware implementation so we've also

1932
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,440
had two reports in one workshop in the

1933
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,360
past two years we currently have a new

1934
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,400
web page and the new forum on the nist's

1935
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,640
web page and just to give some examples

1936
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,480
we're looking to know a little better

1937
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,719
what is the interest from stakeholders

1938
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,400
what are the appropriate attack models

1939
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,920
that we should be considering for

1940
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,080
masking such things like the protein

1941
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,080
model where you have glitches orders of

1942
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,000
protection and whether or not industry

1943
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,199
would actually

1944
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:19,760
use uh these schemes if they were to be

1945
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,679
standardized so your feedback is very

1946
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:24,080
useful here are some links and you can

1947
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,400
find more info in our project website

1948
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,759
thank you very much for your attention

1949
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,719
thank you indeed

1950
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,679
so now we go

1951
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:38,400
back to the jeopardy so bedroom floor is

1952
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,400
yours

1953
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,880
okay i'm back uh i think we were with

1954
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,000
team

1955
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,320
c choosing

1956
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,000
align people

1957
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,120
unmute yourself also

1958
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,159
okay should i choose ellen

1959
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:09,120
yeah why don't you go ahead

1960
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,040
okay i'll take fellows

1961
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,199
300.

1962
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,679
i guess in the meantime everybody

1963
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:17,440
checked who the fellows might be this

1964
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,880
year and last year

1965
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,120
yes before

1966
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,440
i see people

1967
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:30,000
who is leo rezen

1968
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,800
that is very good

1969
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,840
who is leo razen

1970
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,360
you will even get your points

1971
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,840
and you continue with the next door

1972
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,159
please

1973
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,000
okay tearings 400.

1974
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,640
good choice

1975
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,360
and stefano

1976
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,440
uh who is off

1977
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,000
shaham and jonathan katz

1978
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,440
yeah

1979
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,679
that is

1980
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:07,280
correct correct here are the two

1981
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,880
all right the other one that that was

1982
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,280
stefano and

1983
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,320
this makes you your team lead again

1984
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,480
um it always says actually

1985
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,239
and you will open the next door please

1986
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:24,400
i think we should change category to see

1987
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,880
the other ones uh so let's do

1988
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,159
genealogy

1989
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:31,320
a hundred

1990
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,880
hint

1991
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,960
here comes the end

1992
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,800
this is ralph and the hair

1993
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,040
oh

1994
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:58,280
ah hey

1995
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,239
ten seconds

1996
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:15,400
oh yeah

1997
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,320
stefano i just randomly guess who is

1998
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,679
martin hellman

1999
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:22,719
yes

2000
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:24,719
that's it is this so much a random game

2001
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,639
that is correct how many people doing

2002
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:29,639
crypto

2003
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:34,239
auntie may the next question please

2004
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:37,280
uh maria please

2005
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:42,080
uh okay let's move on to books uh 200.

2006
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,960
books two hundred

2007
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:57,360
definitely

2008
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,639
like this

2009
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:00,080
i don't know so this

2010
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,239
looks like uh so okay what is uh

2011
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,320
foundations of cryptography

2012
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,080
volume one

2013
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,760
yeah

2014
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,560
that is correct and gives you

2015
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,120
200 points and the next door to open

2016
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,719
please and lower your hand please

2017
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:24,880
i know books 500

2018
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,920
books 500

2019
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:35,320
gotcha ideas

2020
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,840
and ameria

2021
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,080
completely guessing but what is applied

2022
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,159
cryptography

2023
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:01,600
not a good guess no not a good guess

2024
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,760
not a good book

2025
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,320

uh we had a couple of hints to to open

2073
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,000
this gradually

2074
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
because we had a lot of children and

and this

2078
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:45,520

honest about this one i'll probably get

2137
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,719
in trouble for saying this i shouldn't

2138
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:54,960
be saying this publicly my advice will

2139

2157
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:34,560
researchers toxin conferences toxin

2158
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,800
seminars read the paper or you took a

2159
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,440
class sometimes i look for a and i find

2160
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,760
b if it's not happening to you

2161
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:45,040
now you know don't panic

2162
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,000
the first thing you need to do is to

2163
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,920
understand your audience you need to

2164
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,080
know your audience the first thing is to

2165
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,920
know your audience the talk is not for

2166
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:54,639
you

2167
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:56,960
it's for the audience i want to tell a

2168
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,080
story what's the main point less is more

2169
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,600
what do you want people to remember the

2170
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,159
most significant bits of your result

2171
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,719
don't lose yourself in details uh you

2172
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:08,719
should never introduce more than three

2173
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:11,520
definitions never underestimate

2174
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,600
the level of misunderstanding that your

2175
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,040
audience can have

2176
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,480
you should practice

2177
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,800
give test talks to myself

2178
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,199
three four five six times but i never

2179
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:23,679
practice i don't spend too much time

2180
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:27,120
practicing just be yourself

2181
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:31,600
certainly definitely

2182
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,679
of course i had a lot of doubts i

2183
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:36,480
suspected that my phd topic wasn't

2184
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,239
really possible i didn't really

2185
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:41,120
understand what my strengths were i in

2186
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,560
the beginning used to think that every

2187
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,600
result that i have is my last result

2188
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,560
definitely i've been doubting myself uh

2189
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,719
throughout the whole time i still do

2190
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:52,320
that now

2191
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,320
multiple times along the way all the

2192
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,719
time all the time yeah all the time you

2193
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:58,560
always doubt what you can do maybe

2194
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,840
there's going to be a turning point in

2195
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,760
the future maybe there won't you could

2196
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,480
try to have more than one question one

2197
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:08,718
can also just live with self-doubt

2198
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:11,679
i've never been able to figure out how

2199
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,280
to manage my time properly i also

2200
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,719
struggle with this

2201
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:16,480
on a daily basis i

2202
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,280
don't structure very much

2203
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,040
many of the

2204
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:24,320
researchers in in our community are very

2205
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,679
disorganized

2206
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,760
like me i wouldn't say i'm great at it

2207
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,000
this is still working progress before

2208
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,040
deadline uh you just walk my research

2209
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,360
bleeds over into my personal time and my

2210
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:36,800
personal time bleeds over into my

2211
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,480
research your photographers work all the

2212
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,960
time there are all the time loaded i

2213
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,360
should not sleep because i should work

2214
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,800
okay i need to be working i need to be

2215
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,199
working i think the worst thing to do is

2216
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:48,480
to

2217
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,800
both not work and feel horribly guilty

2218
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:53,360
about it so being okay about doing

2219
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,280
things that are not researched not work

2220
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,920
is actually great never do too much what

2221
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,000
are the important things for you do the

2222
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,360
things that you like and then do the

2223
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,040
things that you can't uh

2224
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,600
escape doing well i i'm actually very

2225
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,560
very good at it and

2226
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:11,280
that's terrible i i'm trying to be this

2227
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:13,520
a little disorganized

2228
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,760
setting weekly and daily goals is a

2229
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,920
great way i recommend plan

2230
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,320
to the future as much as possible taking

2231
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,800
time away from kids is isn't time you're

2232
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,960
gonna ever get back

2233
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:28,719
their um

2234
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:33,040
needs came first and foremost

2235
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:36,400
they're smarter but they don't study

2236
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,840
that was shocking whether my opinion is

2237
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:42,159
accepted with the same weight something

2238
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:43,920
i have been working with throughout my

2239
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,719
career tend to question themselves more

2240
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:50,159
there's a tendency to think of women as

2241
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:52,800
weaker no i don't want to appear like a

2242
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,800
weak woman hey by the way did you see

2243
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,280
this amazing thing i've done i've even

2244
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:58,239
heard it

2245
01:33:58,239 --> 01:33:59,920
from my own children

2246
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,320
we had shafi all along from the

2247
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:05,320
beginning

2248
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,600
every student

2249
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,719
is different

2250
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:10,800
every student is an individual people

2251
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,000
are really different trying to

2252
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,480
understand how the students operate

2253
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,719
what are the student skills and

2254
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:20,719
capabilities help me to review a purpose

2255
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:22,719
give them small research problems to

2256
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:25,280
tackle be always available project that

2257
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:29,080
they really like

2258
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:48,880
all right so we would like to thank my

2259
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:51,920
hands yeah and tal for organizing this

2260
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,159
and i really urge you to go and watch

2261
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:56,560
the videos they're very helpful and very

2262
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:57,440
funny

2263
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,199
and as you can see that behind posting

2264
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:00,639
the link

2265
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:03,520
so feel free to watch them

2266
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:07,040
behind do you want to add something

2267
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:10,880
yeah

2268
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,560
i also wanted to thank all the

2269
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,960
participants in this project without

2270
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,520
them there will be no hope that we can

2271
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,679
uh create this

2272
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:22,719
shout you want to add something

2273
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:25,040
yeah thanks for all the 40 like

2274
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:28,880
participants yeah

2275
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:32,239
thanks again so much guys

2276
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,880
so let's move on to the next talk

2277
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,360
um we have james he's going to talk

2278
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:42,839
about bad random tls in the wild

2279
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,320
we can see your slides so please go yes

2280
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,840
thank you very much um and you can hear

2281
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:52,560
me too i assume

2282
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:54,400
okay

2283
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,119
basically we had a project at uh uc

2284
01:35:57,119 --> 01:36:00,239
santa cruz to uh analyze the random

2285
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:02,320
numbers that are used by tls

2286
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,960
um and we focused on the nonce that is

2287
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:07,679
used in the hello random

2288
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:08,639
hello

2289
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:11,199
the client hello and the server hello

2290
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:12,400
records

2291
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,880
there's a random field in there and the

2292
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,600
idea is can we determine the quality of

2293
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,239
the random numbers by looking at these

2294
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:22,800
numbers that are made available in the

2295
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,760
in the protocol we analyzed two bit

2296
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,400
about two billion tls connections uh we

2297
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,880
saved the hello and uh client the the

2298
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,840
client and server hello random values we

2299
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,480
we save the uh client and the server

2300
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,960
implementation fingerprint since tls has

2301
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:42,080
so many features and so many parameters

2302
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,480
you just hash up all of the all of the

2303
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,159
options and it gives you the fingerprint

2304
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:48,400
of the implementation

2305
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,800
there's a 32 byte uh

2306
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:54,480
client hello random value um

2307
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,159
five four of the bytes might be the time

2308
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:58,000
of day so we throw those out but the

2309
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,239
probability of getting a single random

2310
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:03,119
number to repeat out of two billion

2311
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:04,560
um

2312
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:08,400
uh two billion uh random numbers um is

2313
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:11,199
about 10 to the minus 50. we found 28

2314
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:14,080
000 um client hello

2315
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:17,040
random values that repeated uh with with

2316
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,960
the probability of about 10 to the minus

2317
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:21,920
fifth um it turns out that this group is

2318
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,119
not the only group that's doing this

2319
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:26,239
work also nadia henninger's group and um

2320
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:28,560
i don't pronounce his name zakir's group

2321
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,239
at stanford are also working on the same

2322
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:31,600
thing

2323
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,520
what we've what we've found

2324
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:37,119
is five implementations with low entropy

2325
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,119
basically they repeated uh ephemeral

2326
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:41,119
keys on a regular basis but not just one

2327
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:43,119
key had many different keys

2328
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:45,119
we've disclosed this to google google

2329
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:47,199
has said that they want help trying to

2330
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:49,280
find these devices

2331
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,840
given the pii and other things that

2332
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,920
people have to be careful of

2333
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,920
i'm not able to actually find these

2334
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,840
devices so i'm looking for people to

2335
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,199
help with that

2336
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:01,280
we we found about five implementations

2337
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:04,320
that use a constant single number um

2338
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:07,280
basically the random number looks random

2339
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,400
but it's

2340
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,000
the same random number over and over

2341
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,719
again uh just like xkcd

2342
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:15,920
um and some are all zeros

2343
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,840
and we did find one device that is a

2344
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:20,400
physical security device um won't go any

2345
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,159
further there's a responsible disclosure

2346
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:23,920
out to that vendor

2347
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:26,960
we found that tls scanners basically

2348
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:32,000
um if they're scanning a a a tls site um

2349
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,840
intentionally repeat their client random

2350
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,280
numbers and one acknowledge that they

2351
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,719
actually intentionally repeat their

2352
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:37,520
their

2353
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,679
the their ephemeral secrets

2354
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:41,600
and we found one implementation that's

2355
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:42,880
repeating both the client and the

2356
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,920
service server random number

2357
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,159
well short term uh

2358
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:50,000
like to have community help to determine

2359
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,560
what devices are actually providing that

2360
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,639
actually not following the tls standard

2361
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,880
and and basically there i'm sure there's

2362
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,320
going to be other researchers that are

2363
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:03,440
going to uh attempt to uh reverse the

2364
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,119
keys because if these random numbers

2365
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:06,719
repeat maybe the

2366
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:09,119
maybe the ephemeral keys are are

2367
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:10,159
repeating

2368
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:11,600
and long term

2369
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,040
it is it is my opinion that

2370
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,360
deterministic protocols protocols that

2371
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,920
don't use public random values

2372
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,080
protocols which are either correct

2373
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,000
or do not work

2374
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,159
they are possible they can be proven

2375
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:26,560
secure and and would be significantly

2376
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,000
better than what we have today

2377
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,400
specifically cryptographers put random

2378
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,400
numbers in a protocol because it's easy

2379
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,320
and easy to prove

2380
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,639
implementers if it works they ship it

2381
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:40,080
and those two um

2382
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:44,239
worlds don't mesh together very well

2383
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:45,840
basically for more information you can

2384
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,320
either contact me at my email address or

2385
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,080
come to a seminar that's going to be

2386
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,760
occurring in

2387
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:53,679
about a week

2388
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:56,560
that's it thank you

2389
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:00,719
interesting thank you so much james

2390

next we have boeing

2391
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:07,360
he's going to talk about looking for

2392
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:09,920
postdocs oh actually is this uh no i

2393
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,480
made a mistake sorry it's like very late

2394
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:13,360
here

2395
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:14,800
uh we are not there

2396
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,440
okay next we have ke

2397
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,839
kegu

2398
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:22,560
sorry boguin i made a mistake

2399
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:23,920
um

2400
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:25,360
yeah so okay is gonna talk about the

2401
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,119
complete characterization of game

2402
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:30,400
theoretically fair multi-party coin toss

2403
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:33,440
how do you say your name

2404
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:36,800
oh okay thank you it's a bit hard to

2405
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,639
pronounce yeah

2406
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,159
i'm sorry

2407
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,000
can you see my screen

2408
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:42,960
yes

2409
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,239
okay cool

2410
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:46,400
so yeah um

2411
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,960
hi everyone um i would like to introduce

2412
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,360
our new paper complete characterization

2413
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,199
of game theoretical affair maori party

2414
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:54,400
coin toss

2415
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,800
this is a joint work with gilad azeroth

2416
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,520
and elena she

2417
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:02,400
so let's imagine the following situation

2418
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,199
alice and bob collaborated on a paper

2419
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:06,880
and they want to do random author

2420
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,080
ordering

2421
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,480
so they decide to do a two-party coin

2422
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,880
toss protocol at the end of which they

2423
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:16,800
will agree on the same output c

2424
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,360
so if the output is zero then alice is

2425
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,600
the first author and otherwise bob is

2426
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,320
the first author

2427
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,960
the classic notion of fairness which we

2428
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:29,440
refer to as the strong fairness

2429
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:32,159
guarantees that corrupted party cannot

2430
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:34,159
bias the output of the honest party

2431
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:36,239
towards either direction

2432
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:38,320
however since they both want to be the

2433
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,480
first author they might deviate from the

2434
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,840
protocol to bias the output

2435
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,320
unfortunately cleve's lower bound shows

2436
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:49,199
that strong fairness is impossible if

2437
01:41:49,199 --> 01:41:52,080
half of the players are corrupted

2438
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,560
so it seems that alice and bob can not

2439
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,440
fairly decide the author ordering

2440
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,880
but

2441
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,400
if we think of the first coin toss

2442
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,800
protocol proposed by blanc things become

2443
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,880
a little different

2444
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,199
in bloom's coin toss in the first round

2445
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:09,119
alice and bob each commits to a random

2446
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:11,280
bit are 0 and r1

2447
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,440
and then in the second round they open

2448
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,360
the commitment

2449
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,239
the final output is defined as the xor

2450
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:21,119
of the two random bits

2451
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:23,600
and if during the protocol anyone fails

2452
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,600
to open the commitment correctly or

2453
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:28,080
aborts then the remaining party wings

2454
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:30,560
so if bubba boards from the protocol

2455
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:33,040
then the output is zero and alice is the

2456
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,199
first author

2457
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:37,040
clearly blom's coin toss does not

2458
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:39,119
satisfy the strong fairness because bob

2459
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,840
can always bias the output towards zero

2460
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:44,480
although this brings him no benefit and

2461
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,119
a rational bob will never do this

2462
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,600
the blonde's cointoss achieves a weaker

2463
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,679
notion of fairness which guarantees that

2464
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:54,000
players cannot benefit itself by

2465
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,560
deviating

2466
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,560
so the game theoretical notion of

2467
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,880
fairness we care about guarantees that

2468
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,679
no collision can benefit itself by

2469
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:05,840
deviating from the protocol

2470
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,920
thus the honest protocol forms a nash

2471
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,280
equilibrium

2472
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:12,880
ended in our example by blam's coin toss

2473
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,199
alice and bob are both convinced that

2474
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:16,880
the other one cannot gain benefit by

2475
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:19,280
deviating so they will agree to join the

2476
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:20,800
protocol and follow the protocol

2477
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,719
honestly

2478
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:24,960
so why do we care about this game

2479
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,440
theoretical notion of fairness because

2480
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:28,960
it fits better

2481
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,719
for the decentralized blockchain

2482
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,880
applications than the classical notion

2483
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,320
of fairness

2484
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,400
in blockchain applications incentive

2485
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:39,760
compatibility is a desired property and

2486
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,840
we want to make sure that players are

2487
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,280
incentivized to follow the protocol

2488
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,639
honestly

2489
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:46,719
and this game theoretical notion of

2490
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:51,719
fairness is enough for such applications

2491
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:55,360
since um bloms coined house protocol

2492
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,760
already satisfied the game fiat notion

2493
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,639
of fairness for two-party coin toss

2494
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:03,360
a question we ask is that can we

2495
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:06,320
construct game theoretical maori party

2496
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,480
binary coin toss

2497
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:11,040
and the answer is yes

2498
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,520
in this paper we give a complete

2499
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:16,239
characterization of maori party game

2500
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:19,520
theoretical fair coin toss

2501
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,679
so we assume that each player has a

2502
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:25,920
preference 0 or 1 and gains utility 1 if

2503
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:27,760
the output of the protocol agrees with

2504
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,760
its preference

2505
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:32,239
the red plane in this plot shows the

2506
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:34,560
maximum number of corruption we can

2507
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,760
tolerate

2508
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,000
as a function of the number of players

2509
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,520
preferring 0 which is our x axis

2510
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,760
and the number of players preferring 1

2511
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,400
which is our y-axis

2512
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,719
this purple plane shows half number of

2513
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:50,159
the players

2514
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:52,560
so we can see that indeed under this

2515
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,560
game field notion of fairness we can

2516
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:57,360
tolerate more than half corruption which

2517
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:00,159
is denoted by this red plane and this

2518
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:02,080
means that with game through two notion

2519
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,159
of fairness we can circumvent the

2520
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:06,400
classical impossibility result for

2521
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,159
strong fairness

2522
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:12,000
for blockchain applications

2523
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,480
and thank you for listening our paper is

2524
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,880
already available on aprint

2525
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:19,280
thank you

2526
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:22,159
thank you so much

2527
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,119
i will remind you that you can still ask

2528
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:27,599
questions

2529
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,080
so next we have um

2530
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,840
chandan day

2531
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,679
he's going to talk about revisiting with

2532
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:35,840
analysis and cha-cha from eurocrypt

2533
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:38,000
2021.

2534
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,239
which is a joint with uh

2535
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:41,679
oh sorry

2536
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:43,600
yeah

2537
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:44,400
oh

2538
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,159
okay go ahead i want to mention your

2539
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:48,400
question you can go ahead

2540
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:51,519
please mention the name

2541
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:54,880
yeah so they are um sabasi day

2542
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:57,440
santana sarcar and willie mayer

2543
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,960
is there any connection with the second

2544
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:01,360
author

2545
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:03,840
you have the same surname

2546
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,320
no no no no connection

2547
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:11,639
oh that's interesting so please go ahead

2548
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:18,000
okay is my skin is visible

2549
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,239
yes yes

2550
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:22,719
okay hello everyone uh title of my talk

2551
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:24,000
is revisiting

2552
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,199
some chat from europe

2553
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:38,960
[Music]

2554
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,400
stream cipher

2555
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,520
designed by barnstein in 2008 and it's a

2556
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:46,320
rx based stream cipher arx mean addition

2557
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:49,280
rotation job operation involved in the

2558
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:51,520
water round function of chacha and

2559
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:55,119
chacha is a very popular cycle because

2560
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:58,000
it's several uses google adopted chacha

2561
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,400
for symmetric encryption in dls and also

2562
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:03,199
it's used as a pseudo-random generator

2563
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:05,119
in different system

2564
01:47:05,119 --> 01:47:07,440
and the description of chatter as

2565
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,839
follows

2566
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:14,400
the state of chacha is of 16 words and

2567
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:17,040
each 32 bit words and each

2568
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:20,159
and it can be written as a 4 cross 4

2569
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:22,960
matrix format okay and the quarter round

2570
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,639
function of chacha involved uh

2571
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:26,960
previously i said edition rotation and

2572
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:28,880
java operation to update the state of

2573
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,719
cheshire and chacha

2574
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:32,880
round functional what around function

2575
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,520
applies along the columns and diagonals

2576
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,520
alternately and the

2577
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,440
water round function that is the round

2578
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:42,960
function of chacha regards

2579
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:45,360
and

2580
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:48,480
i will until about now introduce

2581
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:50,159
differential what is differentially

2582
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:52,480
linear correlation in differential

2583
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,879
letter

2584
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,360
some input difference

2585
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:59,520
is given at the initial state and then

2586
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:01,360
try to obtain certain

2587
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:04,360
correlation

2588
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,320
corresponding to the combination of some

2589
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:08,239
output bits okay

2590
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:09,840
so

2591
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:12,239
here suppose uh differential correlation

2592
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:14,800
for r rounds is epsilon and linear

2593
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:18,159
correlation and suppose after a smaller

2594
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:20,639
rounds to capital or rounds we have got

2595
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:21,679
some

2596
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:24,480
linear relation with correlation epsilon

2597
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,639
l okay and then the differential linear

2598
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:28,239
coordination for our rounds will be

2599
01:48:28,239 --> 01:48:31,440
epsilon that epsilon l square uh it will

2600
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:31,840
be

2601
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:33,040
[Music]

2602
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:35,600
given briefly in the yellow kicked paper

2603
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,760
so

2604
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,320
next

2605
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:42,800
in euro keep paper

2606
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:43,920
continuous

2607
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,679
reported seven round distinguisher

2608
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:47,840
attack and seven rounds into recovery

2609
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,320
attack actually for this

2610
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,239
seven round distinguisher and key

2611
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:54,639
recovery attack they uses

2612
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:58,239
the 3.5 rounds

2613
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:01,199
differential uh distinguisher at output

2614
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:03,679
defense position five comma zero for

2615
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:06,400
both key recovery and distinguishable

2616
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:09,440
and also they found some uh differential

2617
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,679
correlation some other position also

2618
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:14,960
zero point zero one point zero

2619
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,639
random samples uh is uh substitute

2620
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:25,440
distinguish uh between two events uh one

2621
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:27,280
happens with probability and another

2622
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:29,119
would be into one plus k

2623
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:32,159
q over p q are small and we have checked

2624
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:33,440
uh that

2625
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:36,080
using two to the power 37 samples uh

2626
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:37,599
random samples

2627
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:38,320
uh

2628
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:40,080
for the position zero comma zero one

2629
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,719
point zero two one

2630
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:46,400
uh that the result that the correlation

2631
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:48,080
differential correlation for three point

2632
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,599
five rounds given by your pointing or

2633
01:49:49,599 --> 01:49:52,560
hater are not acquired

2634
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:55,199
and this gives a hundred percent

2635
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:58,080
probability we verified that that uh

2636
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,159
their correlation at two differential

2637
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:02,000
correlation for three point five rounded

2638
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
zero zero one zero twelve point zero

2639
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,159
thirteen chromosome position are not

2640
01:50:06,159 --> 01:50:08,480
acquired and also for the five comma

2641
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:10,159
zero position we have used 2 to the

2642
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:12,639
power 46 random samples which gives 76

2643
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:15,520
percent success probability and we are

2644
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:18,639
still continuing this experiment because

2645
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:20,560
this is not sufficient

2646
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:24,960
this gives 76 percent successful only so

2647
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:27,119
actually five comma zero position

2648
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:28,960
correlation differential correlation

2649
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,560
they used for the

2650
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:33,040
seven round distinguisher and key

2651
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,520
recovery attack and we have given a

2652
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,360
comparison of differential correlation

2653
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:39,599
in the following in the following table

2654
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:41,119
and we have seen

2655
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:42,400
one can say

2656
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,400
that

2657
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:47,280
see that their correlation i have listed

2658
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:48,480
and our

2659
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:51,360
when the random samples increases the

2660
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:53,839
correlation

2661
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:58,800
decreases correlation value decreases

2662
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,400
and

2663
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:03,840
so according to continuous

2664
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:07,760
distinct according to continuous

2665
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:15,309
[Music]

2666
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:20,150
and we have

2667
01:51:20,150 --> 01:51:24,339
[Music]

2668
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:32,320
uh we identified some incomplete

2669
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:35,280
between there and our experimental

2670
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:38,320
result and using uh but if we take

2671
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:41,040
sufficient number of random samples then

2672
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:43,199
we can

2673
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:44,719
say that the

2674
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:46,719
their attack complexity is

2675
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:48,080
higher than

2676
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:50,560
their claims okay if we take sufficient

2677
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:54,239
number of random samples then we can uh

2678
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:56,080
and we got distinguisher and key

2679
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:58,639
recovery attack complexities uh this

2680
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:00,880
restricted using 2 to the power 47

2681
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,360
random samples okay and we are still

2682
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:05,679
continuing uh our experiment and we will

2683
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:08,400
update our result in the version

2684
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:09,679
okay

2685
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:12,639
thank you for your attention and if you

2686
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:16,960
if you have any query then contact

2687
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:18,480
thank you thank you

2688
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:20,719
for your attention

2689
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:23,040
thanks

2690
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:26,159
so let's move to the next one so now we

2691
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:27,679
have um

2692
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:31,760

2696
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:49,360

2698
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:53,599
and

2699
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:55,920
oops

2700
01:52:56,400 --> 01:53:00,239
i think my screen just crashed

2701
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,239
uh

2702
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,638
the

2703
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:10,800
you're sharing a different screen now

2704
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:14,320
i'm serving a different screen now

2705
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:17,520
yeah uh

2706
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:20,560
let's try it again

2707
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:27,280
what do we see here

2708
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:28,960
it's the screen that you don't want to

2709
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:31,119
show

2710
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:37,520
i mean the right screen did flash about

2711
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:40,639
how taiwan is so beautiful it flashed

2712
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:43,360
and then it disappeared

2713
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:45,360
okay uh

2714
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,440
i think uh uh

2715
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,920
uh just uh

2716
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:52,560
yeah i think this is the live screen

2717
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,719
yeah and so

2718
01:53:54,719 --> 01:53:57,920
uh i guess this is incompatibility uh we

2719
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:01,599
have a very nice new group and uh

2720

2735
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:51,280
best for the last stop uh unless device

2736
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:53,599
is around with a nickname so if you're

2737
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:56,000
around raise your england

2738
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,639

02:05:20,239 --> 02:05:22,320
mentoring video people they worked very

2925

marcel made the joke and disappeared

2931
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:39,280
this is disappointing he didn't stick he

2932
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:41,679
could have benefited from his uh

2933
02:05:41,679 --> 02:05:45,040
uh wonderful humor

2934
02:05:45,119 --> 02:05:49,159

2937
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:58,079
i'm confused

2940
02:06:03,199 --> 02:06:06,159

this is the only thing

2946
02:06:19,199 --> 02:06:20,880
and that was before you announced the

2947
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:23,440

2948
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:25,760

2955
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:41,119

3071
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:07,360

3072
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:08,719

3074
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:15,199
and the second winner

3075
02:11:15,199 --> 02:11:16,239
has

3076
02:11:16,239 --> 02:11:20,400
number four one eight five seven five

3077
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:22,840
and another

3078
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:27,040
footages is that player here as well

3079
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:31,199
i read again four one eight five seven

3080
02:11:31,199 --> 02:11:33,519
five

3081
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:39,320
wait that's also me three five two oh

3082
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:41,040
this is not correct

3083
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:43,440
i think uh you would have gotten a price

3084
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:45,360
but now we kind of need to penalize it

3085
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:47,759
somehow

3086
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:49,960
so do we have

3087
02:11:49,960 --> 02:11:53,840
418575 still online

3088
02:11:55,119 --> 02:11:57,119
and the third one would be three two

3089
02:11:57,119 --> 02:12:00,480
five oh five

3090
02:12:05,119 --> 02:12:06,960
okay then we just have a first winner

3091
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:08,000
this year

3092
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,639

3093
02:12:10,639 --> 02:12:12,400

3094
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:13,840
seriously

3095
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:16,880
okay yes yes i started with it and then

3096
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:19,280
i gave up it was too hard

3097
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:20,719
and then i had to watch the chat

3098
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:23,440
everywhere but uh yeah

3099
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:26,159
and uh yeah based on mike's suggestion i

3100
02:12:26,159 --> 02:12:27,840

3101
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,360
upgrade

3102
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:31,920
marcel's t-shirt by having the artist

3103
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:35,840
sign it so that should be good

3104
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:39,280
who is the artist by the way

3105
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:42,000
