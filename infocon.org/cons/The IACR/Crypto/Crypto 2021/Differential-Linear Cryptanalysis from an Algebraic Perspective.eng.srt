science

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,080
i will give a talk about our craft paper

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,760
titled

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,560
differential linear quadrants from our

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,080

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,880
prospective

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
this is a journal with xiao juan lu

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,159
under dongdaeli

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,480
xiao juan lu is a phd student and

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,280
dongdaelin is a professor at chinese

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,079
camera of science

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,200
this talk consists of three parts

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,160
first

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,879
let's begin with a brief introduction of

20
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,680
the research background

21
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,680
differential coefficiency and the linear

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,200
componency are two of the most important

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,080
analytical tools in symmetrical

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,400
croponomorphi

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,040
differential quality was proposed by

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,280
bihar and the xiaomi

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,240
at character

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,200
1990

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,560
using the

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,000
differential cumulative the same author

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,520
broke their full dds at corrupter 1992

32
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,000
linear credibility was proposed by matu

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,840
in

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,520
1993 and broke their

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,320
full ais at the veil

36
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,479
one year after later

37
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,640
at the corrupter landing 1924

38
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,720
matu showed the first experimental

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,680
quality of the years by linear

40
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,560
corporation

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,439
one year later after linear quadrants

42
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,399
were published

43
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,280
landford under herement propose the

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,239
differential linear cooperation

45
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,440
it is an ingenious combination of

46
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,599
differential carbonacy and the linear

47
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,840
cooperation

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,800
differential linear componency either

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,920
choosing

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,560
prime test two-stage technology of

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
cooperation

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,879
the first stage is covered by

53
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,840
differential

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,840
quantity the second stage is then

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,480
performed from the middle of the surface

56
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,319
to the cell test

57
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,599
using

58
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,560
the linear quantity

59
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,440
let p be the probability

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,720
of a differential from data in to data

61
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,640
out

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,000
and the linear

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,760
aspiration from lambda in to land out at

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,560
the base of q

65
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,360
typically the differential linear

66
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,120
aspiration from that in to lambda out is

67
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
supposed to have a theoretical best 2

68
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,200
times 2 p times q 2 2.

69
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,400
it is really true

70
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,959
may not be

71
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,760
in the mediterranean

72
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,640
there are few methods to estimating the

73
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,319
best of a

74
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,560
differential linear as permission in the

75
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,840
middle part

76
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,440
where the differential and the linear

77
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,239
trials connect

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,360
a natural method is the experimental

79
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,840
method

80
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,640
however it of course limited by the

81
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,518
computational resource

82
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,200
a tactical method is a male

83
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,159
expectation

84
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
the process is

85
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,840
tedious and

86
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,320
complicated and the serious trigger path

87
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,519
may be greatly different from the really

88
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,400
the real value

89
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,520
another method is a differential linear

90
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,600
connectively terrible that is the lct

91
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,280
it was proposed

92
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,160
by

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,840
algeria

94
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,040
by own

95
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,600
and others at

96
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,840
eurocraft 2000 and 2019

97
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,759
it was inspired by

98
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,000
bamboo connectivity table proposed at

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,720
eurocraft 2018.

100
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,080
dlct is more accurately for many

101
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,360
instructors

102
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,800
including

103
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,400
isopro

104
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,680
bs

105
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,800
serpent

106
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,919
escort and so on

107
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,039
also

108
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,240
are

109
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,320
still gaps between the estimated path

110
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,240
and the experiment value

111
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,639
in this talk

112
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,320
we study

113
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,960
differential linear cryptography from a

114
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,759
different perspective

115
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,360
that is a

116
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,560
algebraic perspective

117
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,360
a basket fact is that the base of a

118
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,000
differential linear explanation is

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,720
determined by the algebraic normal form

120
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,919
of the difference of the output

121
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,919
nevertheless if the computationally

122
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,120
inferred invasible to compute the

123
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,400
algebra

124
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,000
normal form for software

125
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,080
to make it feasible we simplified enough

126
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,479
of the difference of the output of

127
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,000
suffering

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,520
that is

129
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,720
compute the edge by transitional forms

130
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,000
rather than the algebraic normal forms

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,840
more exactly

132
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,720
we compute the differential edge break

133
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,240
translational forms of the internal bit

134
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,039
as well as the variable output of the

135
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,199
surface

136
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,319
and then estimate the differential

137
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,319
linear bias with the habit of the datf

138
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,479
then

139
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,000
we can try to find good explanation by

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,280
exalted

141
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,039
search over all

142
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,479
the low hammer weight improved

143
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,000
difference and the output masks

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,360
our final goal is to mod a

145
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,919
clear cover tag

146
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,599
to this end

147
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,199
we impose some

148
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,599
conditions on the internal bit of a

149
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,240
server to make uncertain difference

150
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,440
determined in the first ones

151
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,360
and then such good explorations

152
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,520
the process is a organic combination of

153
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,800
this deterioration research and the cale

154
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,800
guessing

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
is the main idea of our paper

156
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,160
now let's go to the details

157
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,120
to simplify the edge bar normal form we

158
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,400
use the edge by translational form

159
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,520
here

160
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,039
we define a simple transitional ruler

161
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,960
for boolean function u

162
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,639
under a binary variable x

163
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,639
the atfu related to x is defined as

164
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,919
apf

165
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,440
u double prime plus atf

166
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,879
u prime

167
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,400
moreover

168
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,479
for bone function

169
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,120
omega data node have a

170
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,400
uh the

171
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,360
bin array variable x

172
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,599
if it involves two or

173
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,319
two or more variables then atf is

174
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,319
defined as a new transcendental variable

175
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,960
otherwise it remains unchanged

176
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,919
this rule ensures that

177
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,880
atf fx is a htforf in a very simplified

178

for software e

181
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,800
it can be considered as a directory

182
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
function

183
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,440

185
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
can be related as a

186

explanation

187
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,640
here theta is the input difference and

188
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,080
the lambda is the output linear mask

189
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,680
denoted by f the inlet product of lambda

190
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,040
and e

191
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,720
then the explanation is expiration

192
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,640
can be rewritten as f x plus f x plus

193
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,000
delta equals zero

194
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,320
on the other hand

195
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,720
if we introduce the new

196
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,399

197
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,519
small x

198
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,959
then

199
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,720
f big x big x plus sigma x that

200
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,959
is equal to a sum of two parts

201
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,040
the first part is a multiple of x and

202
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,880
the remain part does not have the

203
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
variable x

204
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,640
we compute the

205
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,920
polynomial first under calculate the

206
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,320
coefficient of x

207
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,040
then observe the differential linear

208
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,760
operation

209
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,680

the smart is a variable variable

217
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,560
and the data in is the input difference

218
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,600
first

219
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,880
we compute the h by number form of rx

220
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,360
plus x theta in

221
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,320
then

222
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,959
apply the transitional ruler to it

223
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,200
and then compute the edge by

224
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,079
transitional form of the second one

225
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,440
and apply the transitional ruler to the

result

227
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,640
and then repeat the steps and finally

228
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,959
observe observed

229
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,120

239
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,920
from differential of atf we know each

in step 6

244
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,160
we preserve the original expression of

d8f of a software

262
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,680
we are able to

263
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,200
estimate the differential linear price

264
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,160
a

265
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,120
algorithm for estimation of a batch is

266
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,000
depict here

267
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,800
the boolean polynomial e

268
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
is the edge by expiration of the

differential linear as permission

270
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,560
we divide

271
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,560
the as polymer e into two parts

272
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,800
one part without any

273
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,200
isolate variables

274
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,959
and the other parts with earlier isolate

275
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,200
variables

276
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,720
for the first part

277
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,760
we estimate the best directly from the

278
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,800
edge block equation

279
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,920
for the second part we substitute the

280
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,720
expressions q into it

281
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,839
and update e with the new s polynomial

282
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,320
then repeat the brow procedure until e

283
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,880
is zero

284
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,360
finally we obtain a

285
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,480
estimated value for the paths

286
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,639

288
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,240
then the capacity is o

292
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,920
m is the

size of the x-box

294
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,680
to refine the estimation we can also

295
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,880
pre-estimate the

296
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,199

to the base of an outlet our knowledge

355
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,559
we provided the first correct

356
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,799
attack on its 12th launch variant

357
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,480
and the first

358
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,280
differential linear attack on its 11

359
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,559

360
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,039
and 28-bit key

361
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,280
to the best of our knowledge

362
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,799
our techs

363
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,160
are that far the best on low criminality

364
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,799

greenway one

369
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,039
the results have been fully

370
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,640
verified by experiment

371
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,000
notebook secreting an s of separate is

372
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,080
one of the most important

373
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,480
application of differential linear

374
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,960

375
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,039
the result in this paper update the

376
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,720
differential linear equivalency of

after the work of behind document and

382
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,000
the calu in 2003

383
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,240
in this talk we have shown a new series

384
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,720
of differential linear currency from our

385
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,320

386
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,760
pro spectrum

387
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,160
including the estimation of the

388
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,080
deflection linear price and the

389
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,039
technical for kilocalorie

390
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,000
we

391
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,840
have applied it to the

392
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,720
scissor furnace under the

393
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,280

396
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,720
and again the most

397
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,840
accurate

398
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,160
estimation of the best as well as the

399
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,000
best no differential linear or

400
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,880
differential attacks

401
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,600
in particular the result in this paper

402
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,440
updates the carbonyls of the serpent

403
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,400
with one more one

404
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,600
our techniques

405
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,520
for kilikara is a

406
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,760
organic combination of the

407
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,400
distinguishing research

408
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,840
and the key

409
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,600
guessing

410
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,720
and that outperformed the prohibition

411
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,120
carrier in the differential linear

412
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,918
crevelancy

413
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,320
we believe that this new crafting

414
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,600
analytical

415
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,080
tool is useful in both quality and the

416
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,240
desire of symmetrical

417
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,520
