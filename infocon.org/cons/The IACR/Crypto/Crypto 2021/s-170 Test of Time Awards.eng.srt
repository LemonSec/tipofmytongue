1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,759
start anytime and congratulations

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,080
all right

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,560
hi everybody

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,640
uh this is misha abdallah the current

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,720
iacr president

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,000
uh it is my pleasure today uh

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,840
to actually

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
share this session

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,599
uh for the test of

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,519
test of time award for

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,399
uh

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,840
for crypto 2001 to

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,760
2021 sorry for the bad year

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,079
so

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,160
for those of you who are not aware of

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,200
what the test of a test of time award is

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,640
so this is a

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,960
test that is given yearly for each one

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,160
of the three iscr general conferences

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,280
this means eurocrypt crypto and asia

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,399
crypt

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,239
in a normal year

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,480
we the first one to take place is the

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,040
eurocrate test of time award but as you

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,840
know eurocrypt was delayed

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,280
uh till october so crypto test of time

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,360
award is the first one taking place this

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,880
year

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,040
and this award

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,080
recognizes paper we which have

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,320
papers which have a lasting impact on

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,680
the field

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,240
in the particular case of the iacr

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,080
general conference is this award is

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,320
given for instance for papers that were

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,880
published 15 years prior to the

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,400
conference

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,520
in the in the particular case of

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,079
2021 this uh

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,720
this award is being given to papers that

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,240
were published

42
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,479
in 20

43
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,040
2006.

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,159
so this

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,040
award is selected yearly by a rotating

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,399
committee

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,520
two of which are appointed by the board

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
and um

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,320
in three of uh and the other three

50
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,880
members are the one of the program

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,479
chairs of each of the general

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,080
conferences

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,440
so if you would like to have more

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,000
information about this award you can

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,440
take a look at

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,360
iac.org

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
test of time

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,959
so

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,520
for 2021

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,800
the test of time award committee uh was

61
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,520
chaired by a early mar

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,160
and the second appointed member was

63
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
nigel smart who will be chairing the

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,000
committee

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,120
for the following year the

66
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,040
uh among the three uh program co-chairs

67
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,560
uh we have uh

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,440
chris packard representing the crypto

69
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,440
2021

70
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,400
uh francoise v.a

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,440
representing eurocrypt 2021

72
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,480
and

73
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,159
bushi uh representing asia crypt

74
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,000
2021.

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
so

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,680
chris is supposed to be here

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,519
so uh since chris uh he was part of the

78
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,720
committee

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,400
and he's a crypto 2021 uh representative

80
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,920
i will let

81
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,519
chris actually

82
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,560
introduced

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,080
me here in his award

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,560
great thank you michelle please so

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,360
um speaking on behalf of the test of

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
time award committee

87
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,319
we're happy to present this year's uh

88
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,480
crypto 20 21 uh test of time award to

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,760
mihir balari for his paper new proofs

90
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,480
for nmac and hmac

91
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,760
security without collision resistance

92
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,720
and the citation reads for proving that

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,120
the security of the widely deployed hmac

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,680
construction does not depend on the

95
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,920
collision resistance of the underlying

96
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,439
hash function

97
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,879
and i thought it would just give a

98
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,720
little bit of background about this

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,760
paper and then hand it over to um here

100
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,799
so originally in 1996 hmac which was uh

101
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,040
stands for hash based mac

102
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,640
was proved to be a pseudo-random

103
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,840
function

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,079
assuming two things that the compression

105
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,238
function was also a prf

106
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,478
and that the iterated hash function was

107
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,800
weakly collision resistant

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,199
however in the late 1990s and early

109
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,400
2000s

110
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,840
it was shown that this collision

111
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,440
resistance assumption

112
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,199
is actually false for md5 and sha-1

113
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,520
uh and we soon even had abundant known

114
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,360
collisions for these functions which

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,479
were relatively cheap to generate

116
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,680
quite worryingly md5 and sha-1 uh were

117
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,199
and remain the most popular

118
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,080
instantiations of hmac uh with really

119
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,479
massive use in real-world deployments

120
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,479
all over the internet uh and real

121
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,919
networks

122
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,040
so maher's paper removed the collision

123
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,880
resistance assumption

124
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,360
from the proof of security for hmac

125
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,160
so he proved that hmac is a prf

126
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,080
solely assuming that the underlying

127
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,199
compression function itself is a prf

128
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,440
which was the other assumption in the

129
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,440
original proof

130
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,120
so despite the lack of collision

131
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,680
resistance in md5 and sha-1

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,199
this pseudo-randomness assumption

133
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,039
remains plausible and actually

134
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,320
unaffected

135
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,680
to this day for uh md5 and shot one

136
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
so uh valeria's paper uh had the impact

137
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
of giving renewed confidence in the

138
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,160
security of hmac uh and it's been highly

139
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,800
influential and widely cited in

140
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,199
cryptography and systems work since then

141
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,440
so the committee judged it to be highly

142
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,919
deserving of the award and we offer our

143
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,840
congratulations to mahir balari

144
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,120
so

145
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
congrats me here

146
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,360
uh please uh uh

147
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,039
i'll let you

148
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,120
say a few words now

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,440
oh okay thank you um it's an honor to be

150
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,639
recognized thanks uh michelle and chris

151
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,880
um thanks to the iacr and the award

152
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,400
committee for this

153
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,960
and thanks also to great co-authors who

154
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,800
made everything possible

155
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,360
especially of course hugo craftchick

156
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,639
and ron kennedy for each mac itself

157
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,120
but more broadly so many others across

158
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,479
all these years

159
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,160
and also thanks especially to the

160
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,000
students it was while preparing a

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,880
lecture on hmac to teach in a class that

162
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,080
i thought

163
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,479
maybe one can do this proof differently

164
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,160
so i hope the students continue to be

165
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,400
there and ask lots of embarrassing

166
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,160
questions

167
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,039
so thanks again

168
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,759
so thank you me here uh so as

169
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,919
christopher says it's a pleasure like

170
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,880
some of you already actually know

171
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,319
me here is my

172
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,720
phd advisor so it's actually a great

173
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,479
