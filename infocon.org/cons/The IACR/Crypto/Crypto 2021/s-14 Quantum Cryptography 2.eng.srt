[Music]

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,080
so the

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,080
first talk

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,079
is

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,800
new approaches for quantum copy

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,000
protection

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,200
by scott allanson jeffrey you cheapen

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,920
you

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,360
mark yandere

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,360
fujian

19
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,399
[Music]

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,200
we give a talk

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,640
okay

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,239
uh so can you guys see the slides

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,960
okay uh i'm going to talk about uh hello

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,559
i'm jiahui i'm going to talk about new

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,800
approaches for quantum copy protection

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,719
this is john's work with scott eris and

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,119
chipotle mark gendry and richard zhang

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,240
as we know quantum no cloning principle

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,400
does not allow us to copy an arbitrary

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,119
quantum state

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,680
and this property has been applied in

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,360
quantum cryptography

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,200
one famous example

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,640
is quantum money

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,799
a quantum money state encodes a money

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,880
value and a serial number

37
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,640
a vetting money state can get verified

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
by the bank but the user with one copy

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,280
of money state cannot produce two copies

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,479
that both pass verification

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,479
and we want to go beyond quantum money

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,479
to encode more complicated classical

43
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,720
information into unclonable quantum

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,240
information

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,600
so errors in 2009 put forward quantum

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,240
copy protection a copy protection

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,560
algorithm would turn a classical

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,040
function f into a quantum state

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,439
this state can still be used to run out

50
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,360
any input so that you get the same

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,920
evaluation as the original underlying

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,640
classical functionality but the polytime

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,960
adversary cannot turn this state into

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,038
two copies that both compute the

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,799
function function f correctly

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,920
errorson in his work also gave the first

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,239
copy protection construction for any

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,480
unlearnable functions using a quantum

59
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,000
oracle

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,560
so what's unlearnable function

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,160
a learnable family of functions is

62
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,800
family functions that can not be learned

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
through its input output output behavior

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
by a party time adversary and here

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
specifically a quantum party time

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
adversary

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,800
it's clear if a function is learnable it

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
can never be copy protected because the

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,480
adversary can just recover the

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,959
functionality from the program by

71
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,599
learning it therefore therefore we only

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,599
care about copy protecting honorable

73
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,079
functions

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,239
but one drawback of errors and scheme

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,120
that

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,200
uses a quantum oracle

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,959
quantum oracles implement

78
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,040
functionalities of quantum circuits

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
while classical oracles of course only

80
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,120
implement classical circuits

81
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,159
both oracles can be seen as a virtual

82
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,760
blackboard obfuscation for the

83
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,080
underlying circuits but obviously for

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
quantum circuits is yet a stronger

85
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,400
assumption than the classical one

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,200
therefore errors in 2009 asked

87
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
if we can build copy protection using

88
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,920
only classical oracle

89
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,159
we answer this question with a yes in

90
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,480
our results our main result can be

91
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,640
divided into three parts before going to

92
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
the construction we briefly go through

93
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,400
some improvement on the security

94
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,040
definition

95
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,159
as we mentioned before the adversary in

96
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,159
order to succeed in attack needs to

97
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,799
produce two pirate copies that compute

98
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,799
the function correctly but how do we

99
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,680
test if a pyroprogram compute function

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,080
correctly we're given only one copy of

101
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,560
each pyra program then we may run into

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,760
issues like

103
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,519
the pyro programs cannot be run for

104
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,280
multiple times

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,200
they can be entangled they may be only

106
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,920
partially correct despite these issues

107
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,439
they may still be meaningful pyro

108
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,560
programs

109
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,080
that are good to use for some

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,920
freeloaders and we need to find out

111
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,760
about these attacks

112
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,200
therefore we give a physically

113
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
meaningful way to test pyro programs

114
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,358
efficiently when facing these problems

115
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,400
next we give a construction to copy

116
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,160
protect our learner functions using a

117
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,560
classical oracle

118
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,479
we are inspired by the hidden subspace

119
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,160
idea from eric cristiano 2012 public key

120
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,000
quantum money scheme

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,720
a hidden subspace a is a secret subspace

122
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,280
chosen randomly by the challenger

123
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,520
it has exponentially many elements in it

124
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,680
but it's still exponentially small

125
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
compared to the fourth space

126
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,759
and the subspace state kept a is an

127
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,120
equal superposition of all elements in a

128
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,040
substates have the following properties

129
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,320
if we do qft to the state we get its new

130
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,479
subspace state with superposition

131
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,639
vectors in april

132
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,880
moreover we need the following hard

133
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,440
problem when we give a quantum adversary

134
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,199
one copy of state a

135
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,360
and access to membership oracles for a

136
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,680
and a perp which check if the input

137
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,240
vector is in the corresponding subspace

138
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,000
such a quantum adversary bounded

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,639
polynomially in queries cannot produce

140
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,840
two non-zero vectors one a and one a

141
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,960
perp

142
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,199
and our security will rely on this

143
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,320
provedly hard problem

144
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,560
our copy protection construction for f

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,880
consists of one copy of state a and two

146
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,000
oracles

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,840
each oracle checks if a part of the

148
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,960
input is in a or a respectively and then

149
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,880
gives a secret share of the function f

150
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,479
evaluated on x

151
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,320
combining the output of these two

152
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,479
oracles a user can recover correct

153
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,840
evaluation of fx

154
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,199
to prove security we say if a quantum

155
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,440
polynomial type adversary is able to

156
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,840
produce two programs

157
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
when given only one copy that compute f

158
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,600
correctly

159
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,919
we can violate the heart problem that we

160
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,199
just mentioned

161
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,400
or violate the unlearnability of f

162
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,720
adversary may cheat by making the

163
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,560
programs entangled but through our

164
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,479
careful analysis we can see even for

165
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,800
entangled programs the above reduction

166
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,520
still goes through

167
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,440
after we have an oracle construction we

168
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,360
wonder if we can move to a construction

169
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,199
using more practical crypto assumptions

170
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,440
however unfortunately we have a barrier

171
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,199
if we want to remove oracles a

172
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,680
concurrent work shows that using post

173
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,000
quantum hardness of learning with arrows

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,479
and quantum fully homomorphic encryption

175
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,000
we can build a circuit that is

176
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,400
unlearnable but can never be copy

177
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,199
protected by using some non-black box

178
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,520
techniques

179
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,680
so in the face of this barrier the next

180
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,400
achievable directions are first

181
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,560
consider weight awakening security

182
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,840
notions

183
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,160
there are possibly weaker but meaningful

184
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,840
security notions for quantum copy

185
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,639
protection where we can do better

186
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,319
and the second direction is we don't

187
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,199
relax the security but we only copy

188
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,039
protect specific classes of functions

189
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,680
like point functions or prfs

190
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,039
we will only focus on the first

191
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,560
direction here

192
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,720
we put forward a notion a new notion

193
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,120
called copy detection

194
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,880
using this notion we build copy

195
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,039
detection scheme for any water

196
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,440
marketable functionalities combined with

197
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,160
the security of public key quantum money

198
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
and water marketable functions include a

199
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,039
large

200
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,639
a lot of cryptographic functions such as

201
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,720
prf's public key encryptions and

202
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,199
signatures

203

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,759
application to unclonable cryptography

223
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,280
by andrea koladanzero jeffrey you t

224
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,760
pandu mark chandlery

225
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,559
chipong will give a talk

226
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,640
okay thanks for the introduction uh can

227
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,880
you see my slide yep

228
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,919
okay

229
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,320
okay so uh yeah let's start

230
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,240
so uh my name is chiffen leo from

231
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,160
princeton university i'll be talking

232
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,440
about this talk

233
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,760
um cadence code sets and applications to

234
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,480
unclonable cryptography this is a joint

235
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,160
work with andrea clare dangela

236
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,800
jacqueline and mark thank you

237
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,000
so

238
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,800
the

239
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,880
no cloning principle theorem of quantum

240
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,800
mechanics say that quantum information

241
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,040
cannot be generally copied

242
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,560
and it opens the door to many

243
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,200
classically impossible um cryptographic

244
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
primitives

245
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,560
this example include quantum key

246
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,839
distribution

247
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,920
by bernat and brazard quantum money

248
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,560
which was first studied by wizner

249
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,959
quantum copy protection first by eryson

250
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,440
using a quantum random oracle and the

251
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
recently from the last talk using

252
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
classical oracles

253
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,240
there are

254
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,480
many implications like signature token

255
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,160
implant novel encryption and decryption

256
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,560
and this application relies on some

257
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,800
forms of no cleaning theorems of

258
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,240
particular quantum states

259
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,240
and most of these implications are based

260
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,680
on bb-84 states or witness states which

261
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,080
is first used by wisner

262
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,959
and subspace states first used by erisa

263
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,839
and christiano

264
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,279
and in this work we propose a new notion

265
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,839
that is an analog of both the bb-84

266
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,279
states and subspace states which we call

267
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,200
coset states

268
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
we show in this work that cosas states

269
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,440
possess all important properties of

270
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,800
bb-84 states and subspace states we will

271
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,200
further show that because cosas states

272
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
have more algebraic structures they

273
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,120
improve many of these applications

274
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,680
so we look at these applications from

275
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,120
subspace states

276
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,880
briefly speaking

277
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,600
so for a quantum signature token it is a

278
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,320
quantum token allows the user to sign an

279
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,640
arbitrary single message but cannot sign

280
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,720
two different messages

281
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,120
and an unclonable decryption scheme is

282
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
an encryption scheme where the

283
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,760
decryption key itself is a unclonable

284
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,279
quantum key

285
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,480
so

286
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
uh previous results show that signature

287
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,040
token and unclonable decryption exist

288
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,320
relative to

289
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,240
classical oracles in other words they

290
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,200
assume

291
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
quantum secure virtual black box

292
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
obfuscation for classical circuits

293
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
and in this work we showed that this

294
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,920
generalized notation called coset states

295
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,000
also gives its application but in the

296
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,560
play model by assuming post-quantum i o

297
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,079
and a one-way function

298
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,079
for unclonable decryption and copy

299
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,399
protection of prx we need to

300
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,480
additionally conjecture that the coset

301
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,640
states have a stronger property the

302
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,839
property is

303
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,000
proved by cough and vedic in a follow-up

304
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,320
work

305
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,480
so now let's introduce cossack states a

306
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,800
course that states for a subspace a and

307
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,399
two vectors

308
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,720
s and s-prime is a quantum state that

309
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
satisfy the following property if you

310
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,160
measure the state directly or

311
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,240
in the computational basis you will get

312
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,720
a uniformly random vector in the coset a

313
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
plus s

314
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,399
which is the set of the vector in a but

315
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,760
shifted by s

316
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,839
if you apply hard mark on the state and

317
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,160
then measure you will get a uniformly

318
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,480
random vector in the coset a curve plus

319
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,959
s prime

320
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,920
and

321
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,560
similarly for the subspace states it

322
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,720
encodes the subspace and the dual

323
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,040
subspace in the computational basis and

324
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,680
harmonic basis this is already

325
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,240
introduced in the last talk

326
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,160
uh they do not have the hidden shift s

327
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,800
and s prime

328
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,279
so cos they satisfy the direct product

329
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,160
harness property it says that for a

330
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,880
query bonded quantum algorithm given a

331
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,519
single copy of the coset state even if

332
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,000
it gets oracle access to both membership

333
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,079
checking oracle that is the oracle for

334
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,560
checking if a vector is in the coset it

335
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,639
cannot find two vectors in both code

336
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,160
sets

337
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,320
and for subspace states it's similar

338
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,519
that is you cannot uh having a single

339
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,120
copy of the software state and two

340
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,519
membership checking oracle and output to

341
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,880
non-trivial vectors in both subspace

342
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,040
so the direct product harness of corsair

343
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,440
states naturally gives the construction

344
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,160
of signature tokens

345
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,320
but the l2 time cons restriction i'm not

346
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,160
going to talk about it here but the

347
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
construction is still relative to

348
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,639
classical oracles it's especially

349
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,399
because the membership checking oracle

350
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,440
here will be used as a verification

351
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,839
for signature

352
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,120
schemes so therefore as we see in the

353
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
previous discussion the verification key

354
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,360
is a vvp office station

355
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,519
so to achieve the construction in the

356
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
play model the one natural attempt is to

357
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,600
replace cv officiation with io

358
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,920
the similar idea was deployed to achieve

359
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,079
quantum money in the play model where

360
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,160
they rely on a weaker property than

361
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,240
direct product harness

362
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,720
so dendrite shows that this idea works

363
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,560
in the play model by instantiating the

364
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,040
opposition this io

365
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,120
anyone can try to apply the same idea on

366
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,040
direct product hardness property for

367
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,560
subspace states

368
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,880
but however in the same reduction one

369
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,720
will run into a technical problem and

370
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,839
thus the reduction

371
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,519
fails in this work we showed that with

372
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,519
closest states we can instantiate our

373
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,000
fixation with io and still preserve the

374
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,079
computational hardness in the play model

375
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,320
and therefore let's uh conclude the

376
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,639
first part of the

377
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,639
work that is we show close as they

378
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,800
satisfy computational direct product

379
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,120
harness assuming post-quantum io and

380
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,399
one-way function

381
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,639
and it naturally gives signature token

382
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,360
schemes in the play model

383
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,839
and this is the picture of the work

384
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,600
we also showed that cossack states have

385
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
other properties and thus give different

386
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,480
applications and note that although we

387
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,880
achieve different primitives in the play

388
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,120
model the application above

389
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,199
above the yellow line or below the

390
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,720
yellow line they could require

391
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,959
completely different structures of coset

392
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,639
states therefore we think they are

393
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,519
conceptually different ideas and works

394
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,440

uh on some chat or zip chat

403
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,240
yeah i didn't find a question to cheapen

404
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,320
so let's move to the start talk

405
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,680
okay the sartok is on tight quantum

406
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,040
security of hmac and nmac in the quantum

407
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,480
random oracle model by aquino jose moda

408
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,279
and tess iwata

409
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,959
actionary will give a talk

410
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,920
you are muted actually

411
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,160
thank you can you hear me and can you

412
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,959
see my slide yes

413
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,000
thank you

414
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,040
thank you for introduction uh so this is

415
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,720
a talk on tight content seriously

416
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,800
security of hmac and denmark in the

417
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,720
quantum random module

418
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,959
this is going to work with my supervisor

419
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,360
testimony

420
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,800
uh so hmac or hashish mac looks like

421
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,839
this it is the most basic approach to

422
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,759
convert mac redundant hash functions

423
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,959
into macs

424
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,759
and it is standardized in flips and used

425
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,839
in many applications

426
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,759
so this construction is very important

427
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,240
in symmetric equipment

428
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,800
and essentially this construction is a

429
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,759
single key construction because uh first

430
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,800
master tk is chosen uniformly at random

431
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,680
and then the putties k in and k out are

432
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
completed like this

433
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,240
and for each message the micro dongle

434
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,720
hash function is called or evaluated

435
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,720
twice like this this is hmac

436
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,120
and

437
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,519
the end mark is like this

438
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,480
so it is a 2d variant of hmac

439
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,359
and in this construction 2ds k1 and k2

440
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,679
are independently and randomly chosen

441
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,760
and used like this

442
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,319
so these functions uh hmoc and denmark

443
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,679
are proposed biblically it will

444
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,000
and in the classical setting the

445
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,880
sessivity over hmac and denmark is well

446
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,400
well studied

447
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,640
and it is proven to be zero

448
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,200
against classical grade quiz up to two

449
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,360
to the power n over two uh preschool

450
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,799
queries

451
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,280
and so in the quantum setting

452
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,400
uh

453
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,520
song and you proved that hmac and nmac

454
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,200
is indistinguishable also

455
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,679
indistinguishable from a random function

456
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,320
up to order 2 to the power n over 5 or 2

457
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,679
to the power n over 8 quantum queries

458
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,559
and

459
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,440
so this is the problem lower bound for

460
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,320
hmac and nmac in the quantum setting

461
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,559
on the other hand for the upper bound

462
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,039
there exists a trivial attack that

463
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,440
distinguishes hmac and denmark from a

464
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,520
random function by making two of our n

465
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,000
over three quantum queries

466
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,039
however there still exists a gap between

467
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,840
the proven lower quantum bond and the

468
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,760
trivial upper bound

469
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,240
and in symmetric cryptology it is very

470
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,120
important to study the tight city bound

471
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,880
for each scheme

472
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,039
so the natural question is can we show

473
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,960
the tight quantum security bound over h

474
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,120
mark and l mark this is the starting

475
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,600
point of our research

476
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
and we showed these results

477
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,760
uh so we showed the tight quantum

478
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,000
security bound over h mac and denmark in

479
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,160
the quantum random oracle model where

480
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,240
the compression function h is a quantum

481
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,679
random variable

482
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,919
and we showed that h mac and denmark are

483
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,000
indistinguishable from a random function

484
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,679
against the quantum query attacks as

485
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,240
long as this inequality holds

486
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,720
and here roughly speaking this is the

487
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,960
total number of quantum queries

488
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,640
and this l is the maximum message length

489
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,720
and so roughly speaking

490
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,039
this boundary is tight when arrow is not

491
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,120
exponentially large i mean the tight

492
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,960
quantum certificate bound of age map and

493
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,240
denmark is two to the power n over three

494
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,799
and two with this type of quantum ctv

495
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,720
bound we use the compressed oracle

496
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,000
technique

497
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,720
and in our proof the hardest part is to

498
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,200
prove the probability of a bad event is

499
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,640
very low

500
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,120
and to show this hard spot we introduce

501
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,520
a new idea to capture the uncertainty of

502
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,760
outputs of a random function that the

503
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,240
adversary cannot observe

504
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,400
this is our results

505
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,600
and this is a quick technical overview

506
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,400
so in our proof to show

507
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,280
indistinguishability of certain quantum

508
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,919
orbitals we consider about event heat

509
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,080
and in our proof what we have to prove

510
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,880
is this probability is very small

511
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
and this event is

512
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,280
the event that an adversary succeeds to

513
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,160
just an output of a random function

514
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,919
and here the setting is something like

515
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,880
this

516
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,120
so the adversary can observe the outputs

517
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,280
of this composition function

518
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,799
and here h is the quantum random or the

519
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,559
compression function

520
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,720
uh the adversary can observe as output

521
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,960
of this function but cannot observe the

522
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,840
output of rf

523
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,039
and here

524
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,520
the randomness of rf cannot be directly

525
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,240
used to upper bound the probability

526
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,039
because this particular hit happens only

527
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,600
when they adversely output some value

528
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,720
and we do not know what values adversary

529
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,320
very quickly

530
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,880
and so how to title this probability is

531
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,120
not trivial in the quantum secting

532
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,240
and to

533
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,039
up around this probability we use this

534
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,159
idea

535
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,720
so even after observing the output of

536
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,440
this composition function the value

537
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,840
of the output of this rf has some

538
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,360
uncertainty

539
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,760
so there exists lots of databases of the

540
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,840
compressed oracle for this random

541
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
function that seem completely equally

542
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,760
likely to adversary

543
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,480
and based on this idea we observed that

544
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,320
the problem of title bounding this

545
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,640
probability can be reduced to counting

546
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,919
arguments

547
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,720
this is a cryptical overview and this is

548
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
our results that's all thank you for

549
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,200
your attention

550
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,159
thank you i can actually

551
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,200
if you have a question to the

552
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,799
talk this type on the chat or zoom chat

553
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,760
but i

554
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,720
don't see your question

555
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,840
in chat

556
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,159
okay uh you can ask

557
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,159
a question after

558
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,799
talk so

559
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,240
let's move to the last talk of this

560
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,000
session

561
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,480
the last one is quantum collision

562
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,120
attacks on reduced shot

563
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,919
to

564
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:09,440
256 and sha

565
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,440
522

566
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,120
give a talk

567
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,720
uh thank you for introduction uh hello

568
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,679
again uh

569
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,480
and this paper is from quantum christian

570
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,080
attacks

571
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,280
attacks on reduced share 256 and zero

572
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,440
five hundred and third now this is a

573
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,039
joint work with my caring users

574
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,919
uh so this is our results uh in this

575
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,080
paper we showed the first dirichlet

576
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,240
condom collision attacks on chatu

577
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,799
more concretely we showed a 38 step

578
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,320
attack on 256 and 39 state attack on 512

579
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,080
and in the classical setting volume

580
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,440
attacks reached 31 step for

581
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,760
256 and 27 step for 512

582
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,480
and so we extended the number of attack

583
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,200
brands by 7 and 12 in the quantum

584
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
setting

585
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,799
however i'd like to remark that these

586
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,120
number of steps are still far from four

587
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,559
steps because

588
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,440
the number of steps are 64 and 80

589
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,520
respectively

590
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,159
and the attack idea is roughly speaking

591
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,600
like this

592
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,760
so in the quantum setting we convert

593
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,840
classical semi-freestyle collisions on

594
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,000
these functions into collisions in the

595
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,919
quantum setting

596
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,840
and our attacks are valid in the setting

597
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,240
of time space trade-off but invert in

598
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,720
other quantum settings

599
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,799
and so in the quantum setting we can

600
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,799
consider three other settings depending

601
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,360
on available computational resources

602
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,919
i cannot explain details but in this

603
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,480
paper we focus on this setting

604
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,640
in this setting the efficiency of

605
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,400
quantum algorithm is measured by its

606
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,880
time space trade-off and we assume that

607
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,440
there is no quantum realm available

608
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
and we also assume that

609
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
there is a quantum computer all sizes

610
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,919
and classical computer of sizes

611
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,159
and in this setting the best current

612
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,960
based genetic quantum collision finding

613
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,520
algorithm is the parallel method

614
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,840
and this gives the thread of t is equal

615
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,080
to 2 to the power n over 2 over s as

616
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,640
observed by base 9

617
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,200
and in this setting

618
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,120
so

619
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,080
and so yeah and we focus on this setting

620
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,640
and the next i'd like to talk about

621
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,520
cooldown and same freestyle video

622
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,000
so when we talk about equation of mach

623
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,240
language hash function we assume that

624
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,360
there exists two distinct messages that

625
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,919
is the same output value

626
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,640
and we also assume that

627
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,880
the ib initial value

628
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,640
initial values are equal

629
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,520
and the id is equal to the original

630
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,240
specified constant

631
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,000
and then next

632
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,840
when we talk about semi-freestyle

633
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,559
volumes we assume that again we have

634
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,880
distinct messages that is the same

635
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,600
output and we also assume that the ib

636
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,200
value is the same

637
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,720
but this

638
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,799
here the important point is

639
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,679
uh

640
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,320
the ib is not necessarily equal to the

641
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,400
ordinal specified value

642
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,840
so this is the difference between

643
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,440
collision and semi-freestyle version

644
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,000
and next i'd like to talk about

645
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,919
important previous work previous

646
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,279
classical work on 256

647
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,600
so many letters showed a 31 step

648
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
collision attack and 38 steps

649
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,919
semi-freestyled volume attack on 256.

650
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,559
and the important point is the 31 step

651
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,159
calling attack

652
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,880
this attack is mounted by converting 31

653
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,960
steps semi-freestyle volumes into a two

654
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,880
block region

655
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,799
and so a two block holding looks like

656
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,600
this

657
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,440
this is the first block and this is the

658
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,720
second work

659
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,960
and very roughly speaking if we can make

660
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,120
many semi-free status for 2 to the power

661
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,039
x choices of highways for the second

662
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,120
work then we can find the 2 group

663
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,440
horizon in time 2 to the power n minus 6

664
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,520
in the classical setting

665
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,360
and this attack is considered to be a

666
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,960
very prolific attack in the classical

667
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,440
setting only if it's time complexity

668
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,279
this one is less than the generic

669
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,559
birthday bound

670
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,960
and this inequality is equivalent to

671
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
this condition

672
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,240
and

673
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,360
so this condition can be regarded as a

674
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,039
validity condition

675
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,880
for the number of

676
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,240
ibis in

677
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,480
the semi-fully thought problem attacks

678
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,120
to be converted into collision attack in

679
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,159
the in the classical setting

680
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,799
and the important point is the 38th step

681
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,480
semi-fully status attack is not

682
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,080
converted into a collision attack in the

683
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,559
classical setting because this

684
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,799
condition is not satisfied for satellite

685
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,919
state attack

686
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,600
and in the quantum setting

687
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,039
our idea is

688
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,360
this condition can be relaxed in the

689
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,840
quantum setting and roughly speaking we

690
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,200
observe that this condition becomes x is

691
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,159
greater than zero in the quantum setting

692
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,960
so the condition is much relaxed in the

693
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,559
condom setting

694
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,120
and based on this web observation

695
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,440
we actually found two

696
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
valid deleted quantum coding attacks on

697
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,039
saturday

698
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,840
so we converted 38 step semi-fully that

699
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
golden attack which are two hundred and

700
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,559
fifty six by mandarin and certain steps

701
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,080
semi-freestyle attack on cell 512 uh

702
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,120
biographies into two block volume

703
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,880
and with some analysis and computer

704
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
experiments being confirmed we confirmed

705
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,960
that these attacks are indeed valid in

706
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,320
the quantum system

707
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,679
and the complexity becomes like this

708
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,200
so that's all thank you for your

709
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,600
attention

710
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,039
thank

711
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,640
okay you time for question

712
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,080
um

713
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,640
the first uh if you have a question to

714
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,080
actually

715
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,679
uh

716
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:12,640
you can

717
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,480
ask

718
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,039
at the

719
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,399
okay so

720
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,039
let's move to the discussion session

721
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:27,840
uh

722
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,360
first uh

723
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,279
there is one question to jeffrey

724
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,960
can you explain the differences between

725
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,919
copy detection and software leasing and

726
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,480
how is your security definition of copy

727
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,480
production compared to other definitions

728
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,360
for example the one given in the work by

729
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,760
pradhan zero magence and foreign

730
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,640
okay so

731
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,760
the question is uh

732
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:07,919
compare the definition to cmp 20 and uh

733
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,159
also asked about secure software leasing

734
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:10,960
rate

735
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,559
yeah okay so okay so so uh i'd say the

736
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,640
main first i'll talk about the

737
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,279
difference with uh ssl so

738
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,520
i'd say the main difference is that copy

739
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,919
detection emphasizes the public

740
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,880
detectability of uh of the scheme so

741
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,960
anyone with a public key can detect if a

742
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,279
program is pirated even without

743
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,279
knowledge of the functionality this is

744
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,200
guaranteed by the security of public key

745
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,279
quantum money and public extractable

746
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,960
watermarking

747
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,039
uh secure surfacing is not necessarily

748
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,799
public verifiable but

749
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,559
you can make it if you you construct the

750
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,520
scheme

751
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,440
like uh especially for the infinite term

752
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,799
you can construct in a way that is

753
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,760
public via fibo but in the asymmetric

754
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,480
version the finite term ssl so we check

755
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,320
if one side of the pirate program is

756
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,960
exactly the original program and rounded

757
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,679
wrong and uh test the other program uh

758
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,919
so which is like similar to copy

759
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,559
detection but so but especially in the

760
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,799
first check uh it can only be done by

761
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,360
the vendor not any users also another

762
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,159
minor difference is that uh ssl checks

763
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,840
the pyro program's performance in a

764
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,640
worst case flavor they compute they have

765
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,880
to compute the functionality correctly

766
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,799
on all inputs ours only checks the

767
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,880
average case by sampling inputs from a

768
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,320
distribution associated with the

769
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,000
function

770
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,720
and to compare with copy protection

771
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,039
definition is mp20 i think their

772
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,559
definition is

773
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,000
should be the same as errors in 2009 so

774
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,360
the the they're

775
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,520
uh so they uh

776
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,279
they do not worry about the problem of

777
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,679
like whether we are given only one copy

778
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,799
of pyro program in each security game

779
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,120
and they may not may not run for many

780
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,200
times the the problem with estimating

781
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,120
the success probability because i think

782
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,919
the success probabilities calculated is

783
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,240
estimated over several invoking several

784
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,880
security games so of course this is a

785
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,720
it's a correct and make sense security

786
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,600
notion

787
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,679
uh i'd say the first thing is is our our

788
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,440
definition of course with we only just

789
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,760
run one game it would imply theirs like

790
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,480
depending on like the parameters you

791
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,559
said for like a successful probability

792
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,640
for for the adversary and the second

793
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,039
thing is like r is like meaningful uh

794
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,880
physically more physically meaningful

795
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,840
because

796
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,320
in in classical security games when the

797
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,919
adversary is classical you can always

798
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,640
say i can invoke security game several

799
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,399
times because i can rewind the adversary

800
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,120
can reset it but quantum case is not

801
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,799
necessarily cheap so

802
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,360
this is maybe a little subtle and

803
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,159
so so we we want to and this is also

804
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,559
more reduction friendly if we just

805
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,559
invoke the security game once and

806
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,360
estimate the success probability

807
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,640
uh efficiently um so that that would

808
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,360
like help our reduction to go through uh

809
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,279
supposing uh this paper this new

810
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,880
purchase paper and

811
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,320
the paper hidden cosets uh we would uh

812
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,000
deploy the the

813
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,320
advantage of this uh definition because

814
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,960
uh actually the the testing procedure is

815
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,360
a is a measurement procedure that would

816
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,080
help us help us uh the the reduction to

817
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,600
go through when we face quantum

818
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,519
adversaries

819
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,440
so uh does that answer your question

820
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,360
yeah i think so

821
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
thank you okay

822
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,640
okay chris is raising hand uh chris

823
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,760
please

824
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
yes a question about the

825
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
quantum random oracle for and mac and

826
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,360
hmac paper the um there's a term of l to

827
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,120
the three fifths i think l was the

828
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,679
message length is that right um i was

829
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:44,960
just wondering

830
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,760
what the effect of that is on the

831
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,679
you know the concrete bounds and

832
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,320
what the prospects might be for removing

833
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,559
or reducing that term uh that would

834
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,880
yield an even tighter bound if i

835
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,519
understand right

836
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,360
uh

837
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,639
thank you for our question

838
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,399
so

839
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,720
esl is

840
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,760
the length

841
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,600
of the messages

842
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,760
and

843
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,240
and i'm sorry uh could could you please

844
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,480
say uh your first question

845
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,559
yeah the the um

846
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,240
i guess the implications for that is if

847
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,320
you have a very long message

848
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,679
um

849
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,159
the bound is not as is useful or not as

850
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,679
tight um

851
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,760
and so what do you think are the

852
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,519
prospects for

853
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,320
uh reducing that term is it is it a

854
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,080
proof artifact or is it something more

855
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,159
inherent that you think

856
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,480
uh actually uh

857
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,799
i think the bond can be

858
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,960
more tight about the message rings

859
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,159
but uh currently uh i do not have any

860
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,399
idea about how to do that

861
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,000
uh actually uh our our proof

862
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,200
is somewhat rough in some sense because

863
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,120
uh so

864
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,799
in

865
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,440
so we consider a mini transition of

866
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,320
games and

867
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,560
in

868
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,599
so for example we considered games g1 g2

869
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,280
0 and something like that

870
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,800
and for

871
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,000
each transition from gi to gi plus i

872
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,960
consider that

873
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,599
the

874
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,079
the proof for this transition is tied

875
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,320
for uh each transition but

876
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,800
i don't know i don't know

877
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,679
well

878
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,960
maybe i think as a way of choosing such

879
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,480
games is not good and i think

880
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,119
the balance can be

881
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,918
made much better but currently i don't

882
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,760
know how to do it

883
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,720
see okay thank you

884
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,920
thanks thank you uh prabhanjam is

885
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,119
raising a hand please ask the question

886
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,320
um yeah this question is for shipping um

887
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,400
is there some barrier to

888
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,240
achieving computational direct product

889
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,480
hardness for subspace states

890
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
or is it just because the

891
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,400
instantiation from io somehow fails

892
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,320
okay um so basically i would say um

893
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,119
there

894
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,240
uh so

895
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,880
it's not it's not like a specific uh

896
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,839
problem

897
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,280
it's it's more like when you do the

898
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,760
reduction you will uh end up with a

899
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,280
specific game

900
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,359
if you follow the uh technique in mark's

901
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,599
paper like the the subspace hiding

902
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,240
obfuscation which you replace uh unknown

903
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
subspace with like a slightly larger

904
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,640
random subspace and if you follow that

905
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,200
idea you will end up with a problem

906
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,520
which is actually easy so without this

907
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,680
shift you will reduce the problem to a

908
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,079
very easy problem so

909
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,119
i'm not sure if that's uh

910
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,200
the problem of the subspace state or

911
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,359
that's just like the problem of uh doing

912
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,640
reductions

913
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,680
so but to me it's there's like no reason

914
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,400
to

915
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,000
say um

916
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,400
maybe there's problem of substance i for

917
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,920
now i just believe it's more like a

918
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,079
technical problem

919
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,839
and there's also proof uh problem with

920
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,680
the reduction for all we know the

921
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,760
candidate could still be secure with a

922
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
different proof technique

923
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,640
uh

924
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,000
for now i would say that yeah

925
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,160
thanks

926
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,320
um i i also have a question to the gpa

927
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,520
you achieved copy protection for only

928
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,839
only for prf uh could you extend your

929
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:42,640
uh

930
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,160
technique to achieve copy protection for

931
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,960
decryption function or a signature

932
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,359
function

933
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,240
for

934
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,480
decryption is so we call it like

935
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,720
unclonable decryption so it's it's

936
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,560
basically a

937
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,119
protection of decryption circuit so but

938
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,760
for uh signature i think

939
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,680
uh we don't think about that because

940
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,040
signature token is is not like a

941
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,880
copy protection of signature it's more

942
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,119
like a one-time signature but you cannot

943
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,359
produce two signatures using it's just a

944
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,040
single quantum token

945
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,000
so

946
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,079
i have i haven't think about that but

947
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,920
probably it can be constructed from the

948
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,560
copper protection of prx maybe in a

949
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,920
black box way i'm not 100 sure

950
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,720
but

951
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,160
that's a good question to think about

952
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,160
thanks

953
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,640
um

954
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,960
there is one question

955
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,359
do you rip chat

956
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,480
i think this question to acne

957
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,680
i'm not sure i understand what is meant

958
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,640
by the setting is that the way of saying

959
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,920
that the attack requires quantum lang to

960
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,800
run

961
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,640
or does it mean something else

962
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,280
okay uh uh thank you for the question

963
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,560
i'd like to provide an answer and i'd

964
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,160
like to

965
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,599
share

966
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,680
my screen can you can i share the screen

967
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,280
again

968
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,640
to explain

969
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,839
yeah sure

970
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,480
so i think uh

971
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,240
your question is

972
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,440
the

973
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,280
uh on the setting

974
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,839
and

975
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,160
so as i mentioned before we are in this

976
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,119
setting

977
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,640
and so uh

978
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,920
okay so first uh the most basic and

979
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,440
uh

980
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,680
yeah and uh yeah the most specific

981
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,720
setting is uh this we assume that there

982
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,280
is one quantum computer and there is a

983
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,520
large contaminant available in this

984
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,200
setting uh

985
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,520
it is widely known that the best column

986
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,240
finding a generic algorithm is the bht

987
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,320
algorithm and it finds a collision over

988
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,000
a random function in time 2 to the power

989
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,880
n over c but it requires it also

990
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,280
requires a large quantum number of 2 to

991
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,040
the power n over 3.

992
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,960
and in the quantum setting

993
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,599
if such a large quantum realm is

994
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,480
available or not is angrier

995
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,160
and so suppose we

996
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,400
do not

997
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,200
we

998
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,400
we regard

999
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,119
uh

1000
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,440
the tribute for computation and keep it

1001
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,240
for the memory uh same or equal or

1002
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,599
equivalent

1003
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,079
and suppose uh i think that the

1004
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,400
efficiency of our algorithm is measured

1005
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,440
by its time space trade-off

1006
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,560
like this

1007
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,800
and then uh

1008
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,200
as observed by bounce time

1009
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,560
we can see that

1010
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,440
the in this setting i mean the setting

1011
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,200
of time space trade-off we can see that

1012
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,520
the best genetic algorithm is the

1013
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,359
parallel result

1014
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,839
and

1015
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,240
so

1016
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,680
and so that is the

1017
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,839
explanation for the settings

1018
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,319
and

1019
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,680
and my answer is so

1020
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,720
uh

1021
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,079
we just consider that

1022
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,319
some

1023
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,760
some other conditions that does not

1024
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,079
require any contaminant and

1025
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,400
our attack do not require

1026
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,440
any quantum lump or something like that

1027
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,240
and this

1028
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,879

for more details about the settings of

1033
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,319
quantum attacks please read our paper at

1034
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,760
eurocliff 2020 because we

1035
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,240
explained more about those settings on

1036
