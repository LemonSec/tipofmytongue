1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,960
and

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,240
good to go you can start

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,040
okay so uh welcome back

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,799
first talk uh

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,199
dual ring generic construction of ring

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,640
signatures

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,480
chi hong yuan muhammad s

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,840
please go ahead

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,640
do you have do we have a speaker with us

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,440
on

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,520
on the zoom

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,039
i don't know who

13
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,239
is

14
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,839
supposed to speak from the authors

15
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,360
let me double check

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,399
also if the speaker is here you might be

17
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,479
muted so do

18
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,039
don't forget to unmute

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,040
i'm not sure i see anyone from that talk

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,040
you may want to go on to the next and

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,000
then we can circle back around

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,600
yeah is is it

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,640
okay with euroheat

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,439
thank you i'll share my screen now are

25
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,000
you okay to go first

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,960
okay thank you so much so we'll do a

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,799
slight switch and um the first rohit

28
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,399
chatterjee will

29
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,680
present on the

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,600
paper and he will read off the

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,159
name the list of names better than i

32
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,960
will

33
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,119
uh on compact ring signatures from lwe

34
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,320
can you see my screen online

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
yes that looks great

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,399
thank you okay yeah i'm rohit and i'm

37
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,680
here to talk about compact ring

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,600
signatures from lwe

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,119
uh this is joint to work with sanjim

40
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,840
gurg mohammed abbadi dakshitakarana jau

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,480
liang julian malavolta umkat pandey and

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,119
sina shihan

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,319
so what are compact ring signatures um

44
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,000
hearing signatures in general have many

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,120
people

46
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,120
and each generates their own public and

47
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,560
signing keys

48
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,440
and

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,599
the point is that anybody in this

50
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,920
so-called ring and can sign on behalf of

51
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,040
other people in the ring and you

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,879
generate a single signature

53
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,680
using your own publicly and really what

54
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,599
you why you care is that there is no

55
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,959
interaction

56
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,800
and so this differs from group and

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
threshold signatures

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,519
etc

59
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,040
and the properties that you want are

60
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,560
enforceability just like normal ring

61
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,519
signatures and anonymity so that even

62
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,840
though you sign the ring nobody else

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,560
uh

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,239
can tell apart

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,440
who in the ring actually signed a

66
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,640
message

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
and for reasons

68
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,879
for of scalability you often want the

69
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,319
rings initials to be small in the size

70
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,400
of the ring itself

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,319
and so you want maybe something called

72
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,239
compactness where you want the signature

73
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,760
to grow maybe logarithmically in the

74
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,040
size of the ring

75
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,120
or perhaps if you can't achieve that you

76
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,720
want it to gross up linearly and so on

77
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
and so forth

78
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,599
and

79
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,519
so there's been a lot of work in the

80
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,519
internationals of course and uh there

81
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,599
they are present in different models i

82
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,840
think

83
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,799
uh this might be playing out on its own

84
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,760
time but that shouldn't matter um

85
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,680
yeah so you have constructions in the

86
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,879
rom model at the crs model and most

87
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,879
importantly for us in the plane model so

88
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,400
there's a lot of efficient constructions

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
and compact constructions

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,480
but in the plane model really there

91
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
aren't a lot of constructions and in

92
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,159
particular we'll focus on the one by

93
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,239
bachelor link hash like and others from

94
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,519
2019

95
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,120
that gives you compact ring signatures

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,080
without setup in the plain model

97
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,400
but for our purposes

98
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,319
before our work there was no

99
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,920
construction in the plane model

100
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,080
and

101
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,360
from lwe so to speak

102
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,640
so

103
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,360
let's just look uh very quickly at what

104
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,400
components

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,120
barkers and others use

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,358
and

107
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,479
they basically have a pke scheme a

108
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,160
signing scheme the pk is basically

109
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,680
standard but it has a few extra

110
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,000
properties

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,400
uh it also uses a somewhere perfectly

112
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,639
binding hash scheme which is like a

113
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,479
merkle tree but you get

114
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,000
something like somewhere perfectly

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,240
binding it binds to one of the

116
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,160
particular indices

117
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,680
in let's say an array of committed

118
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,960
values

119
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
this is not important for the moment and

120
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,720
finally most crucially it uses a

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,919
non-interactive witness

122
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,759
indistinguishable proof

123
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,280
which can

124
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,720
be made from a variety of assumptions

125
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,800
but mostly we use them from bilinear

126
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,080
maps bearing based assumptions

127
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,479
and the point is that yes of course of

128
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,160
all these components the first three can

129
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,120
be gotten pretty easily from lwe

130
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,400
but

131
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,600
the last

132
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,680
component is

133
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,840
we don't know construction from lw or

134
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,199
any other post quantum assumption and

135
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,199
this is essentially our goal

136
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,120
and the way we look to do this is of

137
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,960
course we essentially use the same

138
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
template but we try to replace the navy

139
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,960
proof

140
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
uh and i will try to sketch that out

141
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,039
next so how we do this is

142
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,840
i'm going to now show you the bdhq

143
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,720
scheme

144
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,479
but i will not explain very much about

145
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,199
it

146
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,440
so bear with me so their ring

147
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
verification key has the standard

148
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,199
verification key and the public key for

149
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,800
the encryption scheme

150
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,919
and the

151
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,840
signing key just has the signing key for

152
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
the standard signature scheme and the

153
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,240
signature really looks like this

154
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
you have an encryption of the standard

155
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
signature

156
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,199
along with the hash key for the

157
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,000
somewhere perfectly binding key

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,039
okay

159
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,360
and

160
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,359
and also the navy proof

161
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,479
and now

162
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,960
our crucial observation is that you can

163
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,560
use uh

164
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,240
a two-round public coin argument system

165
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,800
a zap which we just put

166
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,280
in the verification key the first round

167
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,880
exact message

168
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,280
and you can have the second rounds app

169
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,199
uh the provers response really as part

170
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,639
of the signature

171
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,360
and so you have essentially replaced the

172
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,120
non-interactive witness and distribution

173
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,240
proof with

174
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,199
a zap and i mean there's a slight

175
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,479
technicality because if you used

176
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,759
your own zap first message from your own

177
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,120
verification key

178
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,880
that could give away anonymity so you

179
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,600
use the one from the lexicographically

180
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,440
smallest verification came the ring for

181
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,280
example

182
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,199
um

183
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,680
so so far so good so this looks pretty

184
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,520
simple

185
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,919
the catch is that

186
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,479
we know zaps from lwe

187
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,880
and this is actually a recent and pretty

188
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
nice and long line of work

189
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,960
but all of them need some exponential

190
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,199
hardness of l-w and in a very crucial

191
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,120
sense this is

192
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,639
to show soundness

193
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,680
and

194
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,840
you really need to use complexity

195
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,960
leveraging

196
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,800
in these templates to show soundness

197
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,880
because otherwise we don't really have

198
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,639
approaches for showing soundness for any

199
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,080
npa language

200
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,680
and so we do not have constructions for

201
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,199
the thing we are looking for in

202
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,639
particular which is

203
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,680
just use polynomially hard lwe to get

204
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,160
this kind of zap

205
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,560
and this is actually not exactly what we

206
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,440
get

207
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,599
we get something weaker but we show

208
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,120
how to use it

209
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,919
so our key observation in some sense is

210
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
that we use

211
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,639
we do not need soundness for all of np

212
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,479
languages for our ring signature

213
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,080
application

214
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,840
in fact we are only interested in

215
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,520
forgeability

216
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,440
and

217
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
the there really is like essentially two

218
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,039
ways to beat soundness if you're a

219
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,879
forger and you're forging a ring

220
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,039
signature

221
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,800
in the construction template i showed

222
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,639
you before you have to either provide an

223
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,479
invalid encryption

224
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,800
so you encrypt under some invalid key or

225
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,479
you encrypt maybe

226
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,560
uh junk

227
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,680
or encrypt the signature that is forgery

228
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,759
and you sort of cheat in the proof to

229
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,360
show this

230
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,879
and in either case essentially what you

231
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,120
have is like

232
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,759
a short witness to say that whatever you

233
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,679
did

234
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,200
i can capture it in the short business

235
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,479
so for the purposes of the

236
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,599
unforgivability game

237
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,240
you can have

238
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,120
the challenger

239
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,360
get access to this non-witness

240
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,519
and try to catch you in the act of

241
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,279
cheating so you do not actually need all

242
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,120
of np

243
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,720
soundness for all of np you can settle

244
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,680
for this weaker form of soundness

245
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,959
and

246
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,640
reconstruct such a proof system

247
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,480
so to summarize what we did we

248
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,360
looked at the bdhks template

249
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,040
we saw that you could

250
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,560
first replace

251
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,760
navy proofs with saps

252
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,680
and b we created this app construction

253
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
that has soundness

254
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,760
for np intersection q and p and we also

255
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,240
notice that this is enough to actually

256
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,200
show

257
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,640
that your ring signature is unfortunate

258
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,920
and that is it i have an extra slide to

259
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
sort of sketch out the zap construction

260
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,240
but i will stop for questions

261
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,279
so

262
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,480
uh we're slightly behind time so let's

263
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,040
move questions to uh after both talks

264
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,800
but do we have the

265
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,320
authors of the

266
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,519
of the other paper

267
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,760
is

268
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,160
muhammad s

269
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,560
king joseph liu

270
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,800
man

271
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,279
da ding

272
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,519
party are they present somebody

273
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,850
i guess has some connectivity problem

274
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,800
[Music]

275
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,200
it seems like um u.n was supposed to

276
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,279
give the talk

277
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,399
um

278
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,200
right he was giving the the

279
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,120
the youtube talk right

280
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,400
um

281
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,560
[Music]

282
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,760
so

283
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,079
well

284
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,800
they will get in touch and and

285
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,680
okay

286
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,240
uh i'm not a child

287
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,440
but maybe

288
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,200
they will give be given opportunities to

289
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,120
talk at some other session or something

290
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,519
like this i guess um

291
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,440
we don't have to have upload they have

292
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,160
uploaded a longer version just uh in

293
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
case people want to hear it yeah looks

294
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,079
like they have uploaded it

295
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,760
yeah it's linked from the from the

296
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,880
program

297
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,430
um

298
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,959
[Music]

299
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,760
okay so i guess we have a little bit of

300
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,600
time so rohit

301
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,560
you know you have one more slide so

302
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,399
let's do that and and then have

303
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,600
questions

304
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,600
sure

305
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,899
[Music]

306
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,680
okay yeah so

307
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,839
like i said before

308
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,600
the actual zap that we use in the ring

309
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,079
signature scheme is one essentially that

310
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,720
works for languages and np intersection

311
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,240
point b

312
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,800
and this works as follows we create a

313
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,519
special kind of commitment scheme

314
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,000
and we use the com we use a compressed

315
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
sigma protocol along with correlation

316
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,079
interactable hash functions

317
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,519
so there's a lot going on in the slide i

318
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,399
know but i will take you through this um

319
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,120
the commitment has the property that

320
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,639
it essentially uses this part that

321
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,279
you're using uh sound is for a weaker

322
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,720
class of languages

323
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,200
it takes in a string in the first round

324
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,800
and the committed value is actually

325
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,639
committed to in the second round and the

326
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,959
guarantee is that

327
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,480
if your

328
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,440
first round screen

329
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,079
witness proves that some string is not

330
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,719
in a language

331
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
you can do when you have a language in

332
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,120
np intersection quantity because the

333
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,519
complement is also an np language

334
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,040
then it will release the committed value

335
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,399
you can actually extract it out

336
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,760
otherwise it is statistically hiding

337
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,560
and if you have this guarantee is sort

338
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,519
of

339
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,600
fairly simple to see

340
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,920
in a broad sense why this works so you

341
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,560
have the compressed sigma protocol you

342
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,399
use this special commitment scheme to

343
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,959
commit to your first round value

344
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,600
the prover secret for the term protocol

345
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,079
and

346
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,079
indeed if you're cheating

347
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,000
then you have to do something specific

348
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,360
along the lines of what i indicated

349
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,480
before

350
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,440
and this you can imagine that

351
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,240
the

352
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,240
verifier has

353
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,560
what's the word

354
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,279
non-uniform access to it

355
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,120
and if it has non-informed access to

356
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,480
such a witness it can use it in the

357
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,320
first round

358
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,680
and then

359
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,600
get the prover secret the secret that it

360
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,399
uses with the sima protocol

361
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,560
and so if x is not an l then you can

362
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,399
catch out the prover relatively easily

363
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,639
and the reason is also that this is a

364
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,560
compressed signal protocol so it's not

365
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,399
enough to say that

366
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,600
you can catch the proofer in the act

367
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,880
what does the prover secret actually

368
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,839
give you

369
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,760
uh we have also used this hash function

370
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,360
which is a correlation interactive hash

371
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,959
function meaning that

372
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,560
it's hard to

373
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,040
given access to the proof of secret

374
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,360
it's hard for the cheating proverb to

375
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,519
come up with this

376
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,760
hash output

377
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,040
so that

378
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,880
this whole sigma protocol transcript can

379
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,720
be accepted by the verifier

380
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,560
so colloquially what we call the bad

381
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,760
challenge

382
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,600
it's hard to have it so that the

383
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,000
approver can send the first message

384
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,440
so that the hash of this first message

385
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,720
gives you

386
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,639
the second message that you want to

387
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,199
cheat in the signal protocol

388
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,800
and this is essentially how soundness

389
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,839
works and

390
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,440
also fitness and distinguishability is

391
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,120
not very hard to show

392
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,880
and this is uh

393
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,480
zaps are also public coin and this is

394
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,320
public coin in a sense that the hash

395
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,880
function of choice is also public coin

396
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,639
the first round message you use to pick

397
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,800
out the hash function key is public coin

398
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,320
and also we can make the commitment

399
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,519
first message to public con

400
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,439
and that's it

401
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,360
well um thank you rohit

402
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,160
uh

403
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,199
do we

404
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,160
do

405
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,760
do we have any questions

406
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,000
for for rohit

407
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
um

408
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,760
i think there is a message on on the

409
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,639
chat from richard goyal

410
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,959
uh do you need any extra special

411
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,040
property from zaps

412
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,160
or the bacchus at all template work with

413
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,959
any public coin two round witness

414
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,880
indistinguishable proofs

415
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,120
uh instead of the

416
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,680
newest

417
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,040
yeah well it would so this is

418
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,199
slightly topical so

419
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,480
i think it does

420
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,560
for the

421
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
the problem that arouses in our setting

422
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,160
is that since we are using this sort of

423
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,079
weaker form of this app so like zap

424
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,560
sword and painter section 1p

425
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,199
we have to take some care that

426
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,360
we do certain things uh sort of

427
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,480
succinctly because

428
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,079
you imagine if this if we are proving

429
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,000
some property about this ring

430
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,759
normally if you have full soundness or

431
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,519
sound is for all of np this is not a

432
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,360
very big problem so we can go ahead and

433
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,040
use this app i think

434
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,000
but

435
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,279
for our setting since we have to

436
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,800
use some extra leverage to prove

437
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,360
soundness we have also to make sure that

438
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,199
what we sort of verify

439
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,399
without directly relying on the

440
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,560
soundness of this app

441
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
does not add to the size of the ring

442
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,040
signature construction

443
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,399
so you have to worry a little bit about

444
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,360
that so

445
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,800
i'll be happy to go into more details of

446
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,800
that

447
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,720
um

448
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,120
thank you

449
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,079
well

450
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,519
let me ask the naive question how come

451
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,040
the first message of the zap can be uh

452
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,560
not your own

453
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,359
for the prover

454
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,759
well yeah that is uh

455
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,600
there's no technical nice answer but it

456
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,680
fits in nicely so that in this context

457
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,600
you can imagine that for example the

458
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,880
unforgetability challenger has access to

459
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,800
in some sense what the so you need to

460
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,720
have some information about what the

461
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,959
prover can do in advance and as it turns

462
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,679
out for the unforgetability challenge

463
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,319
when you construct these ring signatures

464
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,240
let's go here

465
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,160
you are generating these public keys for

466
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,480
the encryption scheme right

467
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,439
and

468
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,760
when you show unforgeability you can

469
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,520
have the challenger also pick out secret

470
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,839
keys so in general you pick these public

471
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,839
keys obliviously for reasons of

472
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,760
anonymity

473
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,799
but

474
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,120
separately for enforceability you can

475
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,880
have secret keys and it turns out that

476
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,280
this is enough information to set up our

477
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,160
sort of np interception cid

478
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,840
because given these secret keys you can

479
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,640
sort of check the provers encryption

480
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,440
within the ring signature

481
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,000
and

482
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,880
do certain consistency checks and that's

483
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,400
enough

484
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,559
yeah i guess that is sort of

485
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,960
what i would call them

486
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
unpredictable on

487
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,150
you know

488
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,960
[Music]

489
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,280
and all your

490
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,360
login

491
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,679
condensation or compaction comes from

492
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,400
because it's a sigma protocol

493
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
uh not quite so the other uh components

494
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,960
also have to be compact which they

495
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,000
really are but in the

496
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,320
so like i said i was talking about the

497
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,000
the previous question right

498
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,720
um there you did sort of need

499
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,559
this guarantee that the checks you're

500
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,400
doing so you want to really prove a

501
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
statement of the following sorted so you

502
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,039
want to say that your encrypted

503
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,480
signature

504
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,320
was encrypted by using a public key that

505
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,280
was part of your ring

506
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,520
and so really to check this computation

507
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,120
you have to make sure that either you're

508
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,960
proving something that is

509
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,360
compact

510
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,080
or if you're not technically

511
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,760
all the components that you're using in

512
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,600
proving and checking these things

513
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,520
do not scale you know

514
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,120
more than logarithmically with the size

515
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,600
of the ring which we do

516
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,840
[Music]

517
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,039
thank you

518
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,559
hi

519

523
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,640
[Music]

524
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,120
richard has a follow-up about the

525
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,760
question on well first there is a

526
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,960
question from akshay aram uh is com1 the

527
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,039
first commitment is it

528
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,559
sudo random

529
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,200
we designed it to be super random yes

530
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,919
and uh photoshops i'm still reading it

531
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,960
okay

532
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,400
right

533
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,760
um

534
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,799
there's a longer comment from shop on

535
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,039
uh

536
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,960
follow up to the question of special

537
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,720
properties of zaps

538
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,320
yeah sorry you can ask me

539
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,240
or maybe you disrupt you can yeah i can

540
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,000
maybe ask it out loud i was just sort of

541
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,240
quickly asking that you said zaps are

542
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,840
here being used for

543
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,159
compactness as well they are not used

544
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,000
for compactness you just need to make

545
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600
sure that any verification you do

546
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
through them uh all the components you

547
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,200
use in actually constructing the proof

548
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,799
are you know yeah because i i was just

549
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,000
trying to relate with the solar

550
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,159
construction and in that one navi's

551
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,360
we're not really being used for such

552
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,840
things because the hashes of

553
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,360
okay so there's something more that zaps

554
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,360
are doing here that maybe

555
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,679
no because we are not using you know a

556
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,120
general samp

557
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,679
fair enough okay okay okay

558
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,960
involves the ring

559
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,400
okay i understand okay yeah thank you

560
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,400
thanks

561
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,120
okay

562
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120

563
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,520
is there is there any uh

564
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,280
looks like um

565
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,600
is there any other questions

566
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,320
in the audience

567
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,320
