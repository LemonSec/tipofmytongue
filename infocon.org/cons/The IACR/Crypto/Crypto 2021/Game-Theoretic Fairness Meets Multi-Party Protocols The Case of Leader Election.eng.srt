1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,040
i'd like to talk about the fun topic

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,720
essentially blockchain inspired

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,879
protocols where game theory meets

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,040
cryptography this is joint work with

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,360
hilbert chang kamin chan and team one

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,320
let me begin with the motivating example

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,160
that comes from real life

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,320
this is not uncommon in cryptography

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,560
community you write a paper and you

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,279
discover there's another concurrent work

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,359
that has identical results this has

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,199
happened to me a couple times in fact it

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,439
has it happened to my first ever crypto

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,280
paper in grad school and then it

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,079
happened again in 2013 and this time the

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,480
two papers even had the same title

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,399
so both papers were submitted to europe

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,680
14 and the pc recommended had merged

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,920
and here comes the real challenge

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,360
who should go to the conference to

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,559
present the merged paper

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,879
a strong man's solution to this problem

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,640
is for me and shaki who's caught there

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,360
on the other paper to drill it out

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,920
but we can do better

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,320
why not run the kind toss protocol in

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,479
fact this is what we actually did coin

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,720
task was first proposed in blum's

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,080
groundbreaking work in 1983 and the way

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,600
it works is the following so in this

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,920
example we are using a blockchain as a

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,799
public bulletin board first shafi and i

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,920
each

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,600
select a random bit

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,759
we both commit to our bids

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,320
and then we open our commitments

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,159
and these are the open bits we will

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,080
compute the xr

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,360
of the openings and and let's say shafi

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,600
prefers zero and i prefer one right so

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,079
in this case the xr is one and therefore

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,000
i win

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,320
and you know this is also what actually

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,920
happened uh

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,720
our group in fact my former postdoc went

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,759
and presented the paper

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,200
okay so i may be somewhat concerned here

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,759
because shafi you know may be malicious

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,920
and maybe show deviate from the protocol

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,360
because this is a commitment-based

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,920
protocol the only possible deviation is

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,600
essentially a parting right you can open

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,040
your commitment wrongly but that's the

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,600
same as a bar team too and

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,479
it turns out in this case it's not a big

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,959
issue because if shafi aparts we can say

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,879
she just automatically forfeits and i'm

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,640
going to win anyway

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,200
so if she apart the outcome is defined

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,519
to be one

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,319
okay so how do we design how do we

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,560
define a coin task protocol

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,480
there are two requirements correctness

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,879
is defined in the most natural manner uh

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,720
basically if both parties are honest we

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,040
want the outcome to be a random coin

67
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,920
how do we define fairness

68
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,680
the standard line of work on multi-party

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,040
competition

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,200
considers a very strange notion of

71
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
fairness and i'll call this strong

72
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,800
fairness in this talk

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,720
strong fairness requires that even if

74
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,440
shafi aparts i would nonetheless output

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,760
a completely unbiased coin this is

76
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
unfortunately known to be impossible in

77
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,319
a two-party setting or in a multi-party

78
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,720
setting where half or more than half of

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,280
the parties can be corrupt

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,200
and and this was proven

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,080
in an elegant paper by cliff back in

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,959
1986

83
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,400
and now you may find this strange right

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
since there's an impossibility how can

85
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,120
blam's protocol work the key observation

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,640
is that bloom's protocol actually

87
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,319
achieves a strictly weaker notion of

88
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,480
fairness and i'll call it game theoretic

89
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,599
fairness

90
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,440
in the protocol we've seen

91
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,920
it's not like shafi cannot bias the coin

92
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,560
she can indeed bias the coin by a party

93
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,040
but it'll just end up hurting herself

94
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,840
and benefiting me

95
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,599
essentially we are considering rational

96
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,599
players who care about maximizing some

97
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,120
utility functioning

98
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,040
and game theoretic fairness requires

99
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,200
that no matter what shafi does

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,200
she cannot benefit herself or hurt me

101
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,280
this also means shafi's best response is

102
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,040
to play honestly and therefore honest

103
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,679
behavior is equilibrium

104
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,360
since bloom's protocol achieves things

105
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,040
theoretic fairness in a two-party

106
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
setting a very natural question is can

107
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
we achieve game theory fairness in

108
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,439
multi-party kind tasks too

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,280
and so it may not be completely clear

110
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,840
what multi what the formulation is i'll

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,199
explain that

112
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
in a little bit

113
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,798
when we first started working on this

114
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,280
problem back in 2018 we were surprised

115
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,040
to find that

116
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,199
no work has considered this question

117
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,199
essentially the whole line of work on

118
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,880
multi-party computation considered the

119
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,960
strong fairness notion even though

120
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,560
actually you know the first coin toss

121
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
paper blah's kind of

122
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,759
in fact achieved

123
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,800
uh game theoretic fairness

124
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,040
before explaining our results let me

125
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,479
mention that under some strong

126
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,639
assumptions we can have some trivial or

127
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,800
immediate solution and these are not the

128
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
settings we are interested in first if

129
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
we have honest majority we can just use

130
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
honest majority multi-party computation

131
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,880
with fairness and guarantee outputs this

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,479
can be accomplished in constant number

133
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,440
of rounds

134
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,440
uh however in decentralized blockchain

135
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,680
settings honest majority is often not a

136
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
reasonable assumption like let's say you

137
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,720
have a smart contract and people are

138
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,199
entering and you know playing with their

139
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,919
pseudonyms the pseudonyms are often

140
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,520
cheap to make up right so it could be

141
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,840
like 90 of the pseudonyms are controlled

142
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,880
by a single entity

143
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,639
another trivial solution is essentially

144
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,479
to assume the problem away suppose

145
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,160
there's a trusted setup that can toss

146
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,479
the coin for us uh or maybe the trustee

147
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,880
set up just pick some uh should random

148
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,639
seed and whenever we need a coin we can

149
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,000
stretch the seed to get more

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,960
pseudorandomness out of it

151
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,759
however in a decentralized setting often

152
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,080
we don't want to trust any single entity

153
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,479
and moreover we want the coin to be

154
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,159
unpredict unpredictable in advance

155
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,560
with this in mind let's re refine the

156
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,199
problem we are actually asking

157
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,960
and assuming

158
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,120
corrupt majority and no setup

159
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,919
assumptions that is in the plain model

160
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,680
can we achieve game theoretic fairness

161
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,960
in multiple deciding tasks

162
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,000
if we establish feasibility then the

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,759
next question we may care about is the

164
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,080
efficiency of these protocols and in

165
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,319
this talk we'll we'll particularly care

166
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,360
about

167
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,479
round complexity

168
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,520
now let me try to define the problem

169
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,680
more precisely there are actually two

170
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,919
formulations for gaining theoretical

171
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,600
multiplied coin toss

172
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,440
and they're both very natural in the

173
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,360
first formulation i want you to think of

174
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,280
it as like binary roulette so every

175
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,600
player bets on either 0 or 1

176
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,479
and if their bet is the same as the

177
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,479
outcome then they win so imagine

178
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,280
everyone will put down one ether to

179
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,039
enter the game and then all of the

180
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,720
winners will divide the pot right so

181
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,039
that can be the utility function

182
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,800
now in the second formulation it's more

183
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,039
like lottery and it's the same as leader

184
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,800
election so we have n players we want to

185
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,639
elect the winner at random

186
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,639
and and the winner will take the part of

187
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,479
all bets

188
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,960
for this talk i'm going to focus on the

189
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,720
second formulation i just want to

190
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,400
quickly mention that in a couple other

191
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,280
papers we actually gave a complete

192
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,199
characterization of

193
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,400
the first

194
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,479
definition essentially when it's

195
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,479
feasible and when it's not feasible

196
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,840
so let's focus on the leader election

197
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,759
definition i want to reiterate the

198
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,599
utility function here right as i said

199
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,319
the winner takes off but we can easily

200
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,160
rescale the utility and just simply

201
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,479
assume the winner has utility one

202
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,560
and everyone else has utility zero so

203
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,160
this is the utility function we will

204
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,440
assume for the rest of the talk

205
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,319
leader election has quite a lot of

206
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,440
applications in blockchain settings

207
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,680
so imagine there's a smart contract and

208
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,280
it's looking for workers to provide

209
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,120
verifiable competition service or

210
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,479
provide let's say you know vdf service

211
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,960
and whoever provides service can earn

212
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,560
rewards so that's why everyone's eager

213
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,879
to enter they're competing to become

214
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,039
the leader

215
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,240
okay

216
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
so before talking about our protocol let

217
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
me first give you

218
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,680
a simple

219
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,280
folklore solution and then you have

220
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,479
something concrete in mind

221
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,000
okay so imagine we have these

222
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,919
cryptographers in the room they're

223
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,360
trying to elect

224
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,039
the pc chair of the next crypto

225
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,080
conference

226
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,240
and of course being pc chair is a lot of

227
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,159
work but say everyone's eager to serve

228
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,719
the community so they all want to

229
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,399
get elected

230
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,080
and we are going to pair them up and

231
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,320
every pair will round blam's coin toss

232
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
to elect the winner the winner survives

233
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,399
to the next round and then the winners

234
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,680
get paired up

235
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,200
and then they compete against each other

236
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,040
using blum's protocol until a final

237
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,200
winner is elected

238
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,120
in general you know you can do it in a

239
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,880
tree-like fashion and the whole protocol

240
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,760
will complete in log n number of rounds

241
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,360
so you know it's actually interesting to

242
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,600
see how to do it in better than login

243
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,880
rounds and that's what we are going to

244
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,080
talk about later in the talk

245
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,760
uh one thing i want to mention is that

246
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,360
if anyone aparts

247
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,800
or maybe if anyone opens their

248
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,240
commitment broadly right which is the

249
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
same as the party and you automatically

250
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,839
forfeit and you are kicked out

251
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,959
if you look at this tournament tree

252
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,880
protocol it achieves a very strong

253
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,440
notion of game theoretic fairness

254
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,640
it achieves

255
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
the following two things first no

256
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
coalition is able to increase its own

257
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,279
utility no matter how it deviates from

258
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,279
the protocol

259
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,360
and because you know as i mentioned when

260
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
you apart you automatically forfeit so

261
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,680
it never makes sense for you to abort

262
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,000
we also want a second property that is

263
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,839
no coalition can harm any honest

264
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:54,959
individual

265
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,640
the second property is also important

266
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,399
for example let's say i'm providing

267
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,000
verifiable competition service to a

268
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,360
smart contract in exchange for rewards

269
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
it may be in my interest to monopolize

270
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,600
the ecosystem therefore i may want to

271
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,320
drive drive away the competition and

272
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,519
make the smaller players go away

273
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,600
even if in the short term it may cost me

274
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,680
something to perform this attack i'm

275
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,600
still interested in harming you know

276
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
smaller players

277
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,600
and if a coalition can harm individual

278
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
players it'll create this incentive for

279
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,600
small players to join the system

280
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,519
if a protocol satisfies these properties

281
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,240
then honest behavior is an equilibrium

282
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
right because if i join the system and

283
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,000
everyone else is behaving honestly my

284
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,959
best response is also to behave honestly

285
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,120
and this is true no matter what my goal

286
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,519
is like i may be selfish and

287
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,920
profit-seeking i may be malicious and

288
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
trying to harm others in an attempt to

289
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,240
monopolize the ecosystem i may be

290
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,920
paranoid and just wanting to defend

291
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,480
myself in the worst possible scenario no

292
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,079
matter what my goal is like i just

293
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,519
shouldn't have incentive to deviate

294
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
okay so we know game theoretic fairness

295
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,399
is possible um

296
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,440
for leader election in logan rounds

297
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,800
and this follows from the tournament

298
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,079
tree protocol

299
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,920
now the interesting question is can we

300
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,279
asymptotically improve the round

301
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,120
complexity to you know something little

302
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
or log n

303
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,519
again remember we are

304
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,279
assuming corrupt majority and no setup

305
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,600
and also going forward whenever i say

306
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,839
fair i automatically mean game theoretic

307
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,079
fair

308
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,920
okay so what's the first thing we got to

309
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,079
try right i mean the most naive idea is

310
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,000
to take the condimentary protocol and

311
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,680
compress it to two rounds right remember

312
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,040
in the tournament tree protocol we have

313
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,440
login rounds and and every round you'll

314
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,040
commit and you'll reveal but now let's

315
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
just say we commit

316
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,240
the coins for all rounds in one shot and

317
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,959
then we review other coins in one shot

318
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,959
and then we computed the winner using

319
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,360
the tree like fashion

320
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,440
so i want you to think you know would

321
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,560
something like this work

322
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,240
uh well not surprisingly

323
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,160
this this naive approach is completely

324
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,680
broken and that's why the problem is

325
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,720
interesting

326
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,360
so here's an attack let's say shafi and

327
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,920
alessandro they form a coalition and

328
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,519
they have a definitive strategy of

329
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,760
winning

330
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
and the way it works is they're going to

331
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,360
each commit 0 0 and 1 1 respectively

332
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,680
right so there are two kinds one coin

333
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,279
corresponding to each round in the

334
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,959
original protocol

335
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,720
and now they're going to wait till the

336
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,880
other bracket opens their coin

337
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,920
um

338
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,079
and that at this moment they can choose

339
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,680
one of them to apart and the other one

340
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,560
will survive and they can do so in a way

341
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,399
that allows them to win definitively

342
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,240
so this brings us to our results i'll

343
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,839
talk about these results at a high level

344
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,480
and then i'll go into details

345
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,320
we have good news and bad news right so

346
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,279
the bad news is that um if we restrict

347
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,600
ourselves to protocols

348
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,279
that are similar in structure to the

349
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,279
tournament tree protocol then login

350
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,279
rounds is the best you can do so what do

351
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,880
i mean by similar instruction to the

352
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,639
tournament tree protocol so in a

353
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,000
tournament trip for the car ride

354
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,120
remember it works by commit and then

355
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,560
immediately reveal you commit to

356
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,920
something in the immediate next round

357
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,839
you reveal and this repeats for login

358
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,560
times

359
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,480
and if we restrict ourselves to this

360
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,959
commit and immediately review model

361
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,079
then you know it's pretty hopeless and

362
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,480
we have to suffer from login rounds i

363
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,399
want you to think of this law about as a

364
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,399
sanity check in protocol design

365
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,240
rather than a deal breaker because who

366
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,480
says we have to tie our hands like this

367
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,920
and the reason why we came up with this

368
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,519
low bond is more because like initially

369
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,519
we were trying protocols that are

370
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,279
similar to tournament tree but you know

371
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,360
soon enough we realized that this is

372
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,760
kind of like a dead end

373
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,720
okay

374
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,160
um and

375
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,760
this brings us to

376
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,320
our main upper bound result right so we

377
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,839
show that if you are willing to make a

378
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,680
couple relaxations then we can indeed

379
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
overcome slog and barrier

380
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,519
so first we have to relax the fairness

381
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,839
notion to approximate fairness

382
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,800
and

383
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,320
on this slide it says little open

384
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,800
fairness i'll explain what that means

385
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,279
in just a little bit

386
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,519
and second you know we

387
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,760
cannot restrict ourselves to the

388
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,600
committee immediately reveal model right

389
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,399
we

390
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,560
now are willing to work with the

391
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,720
standard cryptographic assumptions that

392
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,399
we can use crypto in a general way

393
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,800
um so in this talk i only have time to

394
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,320
talk about the upper bound i don't have

395
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,519
any time to

396
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,399
show you the lower bound proof

397
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,240
so to understand this result i first

398
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,920
have to explain what is approximate

399
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,959
fairness

400
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,800
and then i'll tell you what crypto we

401
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,560
need and you know how the construction

402
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,800
works

403
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,519
so first what do i mean by approximate

404
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,800
fairness

405
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,399
it's similar to the notions we saw

406
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,839
earlier but now allowing a small

407
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,800
epsilon approximation factor

408
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,880
so the protocol is said to be epsilon

409
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,519
fair if the following two things hold

410
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,440
and i'm always going to assume that the

411
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,519
players are polynomially bounded in

412
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,839
terms of computation power so first we

413
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,839
want that no coalition can increase its

414
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,399
expected utility by more than epsilon

415
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,800
factor second we want to make sure that

416
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,560
no coalition

417
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,440
that's

418
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,480
up to one minus epsilon times ending

419
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,360
size

420
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,320
can

421
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,639
reduce any honest individual's utility

422
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,680
by more than epsilon

423
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,959
and so

424
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,199
you know in our actual theorem

425
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,600
we can work with epsilon that's let's

426
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,519
say little or of one

427
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,360
but for this talk i'm often going to use

428
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,040
one percent for epsilon just for

429
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,800
simplicity so this means you know the

430
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,440
correlation can be as large as 99

431
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,959
and we want to make sure the correlation

432
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,360
cannot increase its own utility by more

433
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,199
than one percent it cannot harm an

434
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,720
honest individual by more than one

435
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,120
percent

436
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,920
um and it's also

437
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,000
important to note that

438
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,560
this epsilon slack is a multiplicative

439
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,519
notion

440
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,000
and for example let's look at the second

441
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,199
notion that is you cannot harm others

442
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,720
noticeably

443
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
normally if everyone plays honestly then

444
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,519
any single individual's utility is one

445
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,079
over n in expectation

446
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,920
so with approximate fairness what we

447
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,720
want is that no coalition up to 99 in

448
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,279
size can reduce any individual's utility

449
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,079
by one percent this means any honest

450
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,120
individual

451
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,680
should have utility at least one minus

452
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,519
epsilon over n right so you can see it

453
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,959
is a

454
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,600
normalized it's a multiplicative notion

455
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,680
and this kind of multiplicative notion

456
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,240
is the most natural in many applications

457
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,680
like for instance you could be playing

458
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,720
some game repeatedly and in these cases

459
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,439
the absolute value of the utility like

460
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,319
doesn't mean very much so you you know

461
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,359
it's

462
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,079
natural to like normalize the gains

463
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,639
and and use multiplicative notion

464
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,079
again our philosophy here is to achieve

465
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,160
incentive compatibility now we have this

466
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,959
like

467
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,439
tiny you know epsilon slack right so if

468
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,439
you deviate maybe you are able to do

469
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,080
just a little bit better um

470
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,480
epsilon better but the relative gain is

471
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,799
so small like it's just not worth the

472
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,760
trouble

473
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,919
like if you deviate you can get caught

474
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,200
or exposed

475
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,960
um

476
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,280
okay

477
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,919
in this talk i'm going to stick with

478
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,760
these simple notions i've mentioned but

479
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,240
in our actual paper we actually define

480
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,799
an even better solution concept called

481
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,559
epsilon

482
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,480
sequentially

483
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,720
fair

484
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,440
so i will very briefly mention about

485
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,480
this at the end of the talk

486
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,240
okay i've explained what is approximate

487
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,760
fairness before i jump into our

488
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,280
construction let me mention that our

489
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,840
result is actually parameterized

490
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,080
so here r means the wrong complexity

491
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,640
right so for for any r that's at least

492
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,039
some constant times log log n we can

493
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,760
achieve roughly speaking 2 to the minus

494
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,520
r fairness

495
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,200
so one thing to observe is that as

496
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,840
number of rounds are increases

497
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,160
the slack or approximation factor will

498
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,720
drop exponentially fast so this is like

499
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,520
a sharp curve

500
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,520
okay i'm going to next tell you how our

501
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
construction works at a very high level

502
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,320
we use a combination of extractors and

503
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,760
honest majority

504
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,840
multi-party computation

505
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,440
so when you first see this you should be

506
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,120
surprised because you know didn't i just

507
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,559
tell you we are working with corrupt

508
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,120
majority like majority coalitions so how

509
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,840
can honest majority mpc be useful in

510
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,960
this setting

511
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,960
and but you'll see that in a little bit

512
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,360
okay so let's dive into the technical

513
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,280
details of the construction i'll first

514
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,200
start with the straw man and the

515
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,799
strongman scheme actually relies on the

516
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,440
random article and and it has a couple

517
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,120
flaws but we are going to you know fix

518
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,280
these couple flaws one by one and we can

519
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,600
remove the random article at the end and

520
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,120
at the very end of the talk i'll quickly

521
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,720
mention

522
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,480
about this sequential fairness and now

523
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,120
i'll conclude

524
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,120
so here's the blueprint that we have a

525
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,440
large number of players and

526
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,600
first we will you know

527
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
this is a universe reduction tag we will

528
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,480
first

529
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,280
uh

530
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,440
sample a small committee that's poly

531
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,320
login size and then we will run the

532
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,559
tournament tree protocol among the poly

533
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,039
log size committee and because you know

534
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,120
the committee is probably logging sites

535
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,559
the tournament three protocol will

536
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,840
completing log login rounds

537
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,240
so what remains to be answered is how do

538
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
we do this committee election and we

539
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,520
also want the committee election to

540
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,640
complete in a small number of rounds

541
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,600
okay so let's see

542
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,240
first here's a straw man approach this

543
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,880
approach is actually inspired by

544
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,159
proof of stake protocols like snow white

545
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,799
imagine each player posts a random bit

546
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,960
to the blockchain and the concatenation

547
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,720
of all of these bits is fed into a

548
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,840
random article let's say shaft 56

549
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,600
and then the outcome is used to elect a

550
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,799
polylog size committee

551
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,400
okay so from now on i will assume that

552
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,559
if anyone aborts then their bit is just

553
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,399
treated as a default bit zero

554
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,640
let's think about what this protocol

555
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,280
gives us imagine that the

556
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,679
red players form a coalition

557
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,600
the coalition has some advantage over

558
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,360
the honest players because they can wait

559
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,039
until the honest players post their

560
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,120
coins they can look at honest coins and

561
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,960
then decide their own kinds this means

562
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,640
they can try different combinations of

563
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,080
their own kinds

564
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,840
by making queries to the random article

565
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,480
multiple times and then they can pick a

566
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,400
combination that helps itself the most

567
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
uh recall that you know eventually we

568
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,799
will elect a winner among the committee

569
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,360
right so if the coalition wants to you

570
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,120
know get elected

571
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,960
their best shot is to increase their

572
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,159
representation in the committee like

573
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,520
they should get as many seats as

574
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,400
possible

575
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,120
in the committee

576
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,039
so let's say this is the coalition's

577
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,280
objective

578
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,360
fortunately we can prove that

579
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,840
a coalition that controls any constant

580
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,320
fraction of players cannot increase its

581
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,919
representation on the committee

582
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,480
noticeably more than its fair share

583
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,559
for example suppose the coalition

584
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,320
controls 99

585
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,280
then in this case you know the committee

586
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,400
should also

587
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,760
be roughly 99 red

588
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,720
and not too much more

589
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,919
so this means that any coalition that

590
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,440
controls the constant fraction of the

591
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,799
players

592
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,919
cannot benefit itself noticeably and

593
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,360
proving this is

594
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,039
pretty straightforward

595
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,880
first we can show you know for a single

596
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,360
random article query uh using a standard

597
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,919
channel bond basically the probability

598
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,080
that the committee is bad is negligibly

599
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,559
small and here a bad committee means

600
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,679
that it's more than

601
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,400
99.1 percent red

602
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,679
okay now if the coalition is

603
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,080
polynomially bounded it can only make

604
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
polynomially many random article queries

605
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,760
so we can just take a union bound over

606
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,240
this polynomially many uh random article

607
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,200
queries

608
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,440
and and we can conclude basically except

609
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,159
with negligible probability um

610
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,200
the committee will be at most 99.9

611
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,440
red

612
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,840
okay

613
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,159
so that was the good news but the scheme

614
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,720
has a couple flaws and

615
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
the first problem

616
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,799
is that a large coalition can actually

617
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,158
harm a single individual

618
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,240
so the kind of trainer bond we saw right

619
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,600
and

620
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,120
it works for like a significantly large

621
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,440
uh it works for like a large enough

622
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,240
population but it doesn't actually work

623
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,960
for

624
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,799
a single individual

625
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,640
or a small population

626
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,400
and here you know we are worried about a

627
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,760
single individual being harmed

628
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,880
and if you want to harm

629
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,039
an honest individual you can do the same

630
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,440
attack you can wait until the honest

631
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,520
people post their coins and then you can

632
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,039
try different combinations of your own

633
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,960
kinds and pick one that

634
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,600
excludes this single individual so

635
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,880
intuitively

636
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,279
you know what's the intuition here like

637
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,600
it's easy for you to make sure

638
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,919
a specific individual is either excluded

639
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,200
or included

640
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,880
but if you want to make sure that many

641
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,080
honest people are excluded or many

642
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,640
red players are included then that's

643
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,880
much

644
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,760
harder and for a similar reason you know

645
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,919
we have the second flaw and basically

646
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,080
a small coalition actually can benefit

647
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,640
itself significantly

648
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
so at first sight like you may be

649
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,320
shocked right because you know earlier i

650
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,400
said a large correlation cannot benefit

651
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,159
itself noticeably but now i'm telling

652
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,960
you a small coalition can benefit itself

653
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,039
significantly it seems really

654
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,559
counter-intuitive because you know it

655
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,640
should somehow be easier to defend

656
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,840
against the small coalition

657
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,080
but on the other hand like if you think

658
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,039
about it

659
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,640
we have a multiplicative notion of

660
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,480
fairness right so for let's say a single

661
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,960
individual it's normal utility is like

662
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,279
just one over n so even if it can

663
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,360
increase its utility just by a tiny bit

664
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,440
let's say i can increase by one over n

665
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,279
i'm already doing twice better and

666
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,200
that's significant by our definition

667
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,559
because anything more than one plus

668
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,159
epsilon is considered significant

669
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,760
so in some sense it's actually you know

670
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,120
in this case

671
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,159
um maybe the small coalition is actually

672
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,080
harder to defend against

673
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,240
and again it's the same kind of attack

674
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,400
the small coalition can wait till honest

675
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,720
people post their coins and then try

676
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,080
different combinations of their own

677
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,120
kinds

678
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
um to increase their representation on

679
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,678
the committee

680
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,000
so we are going to fix these problems

681
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,919
one by one and let's first begin with

682
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,840
the you know the first problem

683
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,600
um a large coalition can harm

684
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,000
a single honest individual

685
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,120
to fix this problem

686
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,919
our observation is that if you want to

687
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,520
exclude some individual from the

688
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,600
committee you have to know the identity

689
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,120
of the victim

690
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,480
and so our idea is to make sure you know

691
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,080
you don't know the identity of the

692
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,039
victim and

693
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,120
and how does this work so let's say

694
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,640
every player

695
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,320
they're not going to use their real

696
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,080
identities

697
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,520
in the

698
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,840
committee selection they're going to

699
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,880
pick a virtual id at random

700
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,720
so they know their virtual id but other

701
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,919
people don't

702
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,840
and now they can commit to their virtual

703
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,520
id

704
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,960
here's a big envelope but actually

705
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,919
everyone's

706
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,840
committing to its virtual id separately

707
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,480
and we still run the same protocol but

708
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,919
the only difference here is that we are

709
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,440
running this random oracle-based

710
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,919
committee selection on the virtual ids

711
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,360
instead

712
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,480
and and

713
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,320
only when we finish

714
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
the virtual id election

715
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,360
do people open their virtual ids and now

716
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,200
we find the reverse mapping and we can

717
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
know you know who actually lands in the

718
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,600
committee and then

719
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,520
we just you know run the tournament tree

720
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,200
among the committee and elect the final

721
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,360
winner

722
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,159
so there is actually a small subtlety

723
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,400
here

724
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,640
and if you just do this it turns out it

725
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,120
doesn't work and here's an attack like

726
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,799
let's say the coalition doesn't know

727
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,200
honest people's virtual ids but they do

728
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,440
know their own virtual ids right so they

729
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
can place all of their virtual ids like

730
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,399
they can

731
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,159
um

732
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,159
pick uh

733
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,080
the same virtual id let's say every

734
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,919
every coalition member picks the same

735
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,360
virtual id

736
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,559
and then

737
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,960
and they can pick

738
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,200
their coins carefully to make sure that

739
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,000
specific virtual id is included in the

740
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,399
committee so this way

741
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,440
every

742
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,960
red player

743
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,559
can become part of the committee and

744
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,200
that's bad

745
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
and to eliminate this attack

746
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,760
we are going to modify the rule just

747
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,159
slightly we are going to say you know

748
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,480
your your this virtual id is only

749
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,799
elected into the committee if there's no

750
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,440
collision with other virtual ids

751
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,200
so if you are going to put your eggs in

752
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,880
one basket and then make sure that

753
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,440
basket is you know elected that's not

754
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,120
going to work because it's just going to

755
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,120
cause collision among yourselves

756
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,000
so if you introduce this fix it'll

757
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,840
almost work except that you just have to

758
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,760
make the virtual id space a little bit

759
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,840
larger to make the collision probability

760
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,480
small enough so i won't tell you the

761
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,799
detailed parameters here

762
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,760
but essentially with this modification

763
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,679
we can fix the first problem

764
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,799
and now we just have to

765
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,120
focus on how to fix the second problem

766
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,520
a small correlation can benefit itself

767
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,399
significantly

768
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,840
so how do we fix this problem

769
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,159
in fact earlier i already kind of gave

770
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,919
away the solution right because i told

771
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,679
you you know our solution involves the

772
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,039
honest majority mpc and here is where we

773
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,559
use on this majority npc

774
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,679
the idea is that

775
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,640
and

776
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,039
you know players don't choose their own

777
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,080
virtual ids right

778
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,279
so the reason that a coalition can help

779
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,360
itself is because

780
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,799
every player knows their own virtual id

781
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,039
um

782
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,440
okay so in order to make sure people

783
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,240
don't know even their own virtual id's

784
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,799
uh we will have every player pick a

785
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,440
random unmasked virtual id but this is

786
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,760
not your final virtual id and to get

787
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,399
your final virtual id you have to apply

788
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,039
another masking permutation

789
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,039
and this masking permutation will be

790
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,520
chosen using honest majority npc

791
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,320
so if the correlation is small let's say

792
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,399
less than one percent

793
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,520
and then

794
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,320
you know the honest majority npc has

795
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,480
privacy right so the coalition has no

796
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,240
idea what this masking permutation is

797
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,559
and therefore it doesn't have any idea

798
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,320
what its own virtual ids are

799
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,440
and

800
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,200
so that's the idea

801
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,200
uh and now the question is

802
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,760
what happens with large coalitions so

803
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,679
for large coalitions the honest majority

804
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,440
npc is completely broken it doesn't have

805
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,679
any security but that doesn't matter

806
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,600
because we can get fairness from like

807
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,120
the first part of the construction right

808
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,240
the argument we saw earlier um

809
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,880
earlier we showed that you know a large

810
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,480
coalition cannot benefit itself

811
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,039
noticeably and that same argument still

812
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,559
applies here even with the new

813
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,360
modifications

814
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,279
okay so when we combine these ideas we

815
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,240
can fix both of these flaws

816
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,080
and and the resulting scheme should work

817
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,159
and the only problem that remains is we

818
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,519
still have a random article and we want

819
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,320
to get rid of it

820
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,519
at a high level we want to replace the

821
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,120
random article with a combinatorial

822
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,440
object called a sampler and this is kind

823
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,320
of equivalent to like a seeded extractor

824
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,559
but it's not just so simple as it turns

825
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,320
out we'll have to introduce some other

826
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,880
changes to the protocol to make it work

827
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,480
one thing to keep in mind is that

828
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,440
earlier

829
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,279
our proof relied on the fact that the

830
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,960
coalition can only make polynomially

831
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
many random article queries

832
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
but once we replace the random article

833
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,279
with the sampler we'll have to make a

834
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,480
comment combinatorial arguments instead

835
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,399
like without any regard to the player's

836
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,480
computational balance

837
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,320
unfortunately for this talk i actually

838
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
won't have time to

839
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,919
tell you how to get rid of the random

840
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,840
article in details so let me just skip

841
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,480
to the end

842
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,399
okay

843
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,120
and at a high level in order to replace

844
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,279
the random article with the sampler we

845
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,200
actually need to adopt a two-phase

846
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,559
committee election strategy so first we

847
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,960
run a single iteration of figures like

848
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,960
spin protocol to elect what's called a

849
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,279
preliminary committee

850
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,360
but we're not running

851
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,120
the tournamentary protocol among the

852
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,200
prelim preliminary committee

853
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,840
so the preliminary committee will then

854
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,880
um

855
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,880
run a protocol just like the random

856
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,120
oracle-based protocol we saw to elect

857
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,120
the final committee but of course now we

858
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,720
want to replace random oracle with the

859
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,120
sampler

860
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,240
and finally we'll run parliament 3

861
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,720
among the final committee to elect the

862
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,440
final leader

863
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,399
okay

864
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,919
so i'm going to ask you to read the

865
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,159
paper for the details of the scheme as

866
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,039
well as proofs

867
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,120
before i conclude i want to say you know

868
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,960
i mentioned about sequential fairness

869
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,399
right i'm just going to say a few words

870
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,159
at a high level

871
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,240
epsilon fairness which is the notion we

872
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,679
saw requires that a priori before the

873
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,240
protocol starts the coalition has little

874
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,320
incentive to deviate

875
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,760
but it could be

876
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,000
that with some small but non-negligible

877
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,919
probability let's say epsilon over two

878
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,720
probability some bad event happens let's

879
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,039
say you know with small probability

880
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,360
alice stills bob's

881
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,799
secret key

882
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,039
um and if this bad event happens right

883
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,440
conditioned on the bad didn't happen

884
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,399
and

885
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,880
alice does have incentive to deviate

886
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
because in that case he maybe she can

887
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,080
just steal bob's bitcoins

888
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,559
but because this bad event happens with

889
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,720
let's say only epsilon over two

890
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,519
probability that a priori alice actually

891
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,679
doesn't have a noticeable incentive to

892
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:48,960
deviate

893
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,039
so if we just use the current epsilon

894
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,519
fairness notion like it would sometimes

895
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,440
fail to rule out

896
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,559
uh undesirable protocols like this

897
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,159
and that's why we think epsilon

898
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,159
sequential fairness is a better solution

899
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,880
concept for approximate fairness

900
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,960
roughly speaking the sequential notion

901
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,199
requires that except with negligible

902
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,879
probability at no points in the protocol

903
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,560
should you have noticeable incentive to

904
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,040
deviate

905
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,560
okay so i'll just leave it at this

906
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,879
please read the paper for the details

907
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,960
and what's interesting here is that this

908
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,199
actually shows like even how to define

909
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,119
approximate game theoretic fairness is

910
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,359
non-trivial and requires careful

911
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,359
considerations

912
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,440
okay finally i want to conclude by

913
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,280
saying that you know game theory means

914
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,320
crypto

915
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,280
um

916
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,199
is much needed in decentralized

917
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,839
blockchain applications just like most

918
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,639
blockchain ideas in this space actually

919
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,359
industry is you know ahead of research

920
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,520
um

921
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,199
in many cases it's like it's not even

922
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,879
clear how to model things or how to

923
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,280
formulate the problem and i personally

924
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,119
think you know this is an exciting area

925
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,400
that needs

926
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,320
new scientific foundations

927
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,640
and also it needs like interdisciplinary

928
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,680
research

929
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,399
thank you very much
