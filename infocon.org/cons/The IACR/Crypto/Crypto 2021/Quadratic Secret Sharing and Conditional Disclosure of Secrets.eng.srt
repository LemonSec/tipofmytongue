1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,519
uh hi i am hussein i will be talking

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,000
about a quadratic secret sharing and

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
quadratic conventional disclosure of

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,639
secrets uh this is a joint work with the

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,719
almost saved email and the nativity

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,640
so i will start by a general

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,240
descriptions description of our results

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,400
the notation that i will use in this

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,119
slide will be familiar clear in a few

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,480
slides

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,039
so we study polynomial secret sharing

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,400
which is which

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,360
generalizes the well-studied linear a

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,760
secret sharing

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,920
the motivation in studying polynomial

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,399
secret sharing first we want to

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,480
construct a new efficient secret sharing

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,360
schemes for x structures and second we

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,760
want to prove lower bounds for a larger

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,600
class of schemes

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,879
so in terms of result we we construct a

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,680
quadratic secret sharing schemes that

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
are better than the best

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,559
is secret sharing schemes and we

25
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,399
construct a quadratic

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,400
to conditional disclosure of secrets of

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,560
protocols that are better than the

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,720
linear protocols

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,680
and we prove lower bounds for polynomial

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,000
secret sharing

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,840
so in this talk i will start by an

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
introduction of secret sharing and the

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,560
previous results in secret sharing i

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,680
will then

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,159
introduce polynomial secret sharing

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,920
define it and they

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,159
describe the motivation by studying

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,400
programming and secret sharing then i

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,280
will

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,840
present our results in polynomial secret

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,479
sharing and then i will

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,200
describe a building a block that we use

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,799
in our reconstruction which is

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,720
polynomial conditional disclosure of

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,880
secrets then i will summarize and

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,799
discuss open questions left

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,520
by our work

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,719
so secret sharing skins were defined

49
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,119
independently by shamir and black

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,880
in 79 for the threshold case and by ato

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,479
it was certain

52
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,560
it is even for the

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,479
general case so in secret sharing there

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,520
is a leader who holds a secret s and

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,000
there is a set of n parties the the

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,040
dealer

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,760
applies a function on the secret s and

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,840
some random string r

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,760
generates and shares and gives each

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,360
party a share

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
we say where we define an access

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,640
structure gamma as a collection of

63
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,120
authorized sets of parties and we say

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,360
that a secret challenge scheme realizes

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,080
gamma if the two following conditions

66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,480
first for correctness we require that

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,800
anything that is in gamma should learn

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,040
the secret

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,280
and for security we require that any set

70
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,360
that is not in gamma and it's called an

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,440
authorized set should learn nothing

72
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,120
about that

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
so in this talk the secret is only one

74
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,280
bit which is a zero or one

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,720
now we start by a warm up which is a

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,959
secret sharing scheme realizing that

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,080
structure

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,200
so in this axis structure

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
there is only one of the right set which

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,519
is the set of all the parties

81
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,319
and every other set is an authorized set

82
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,599
so

83
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,599
the construction is as follows the

84
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,319
cigarette you have the secret is that

85
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,720
the data it chooses n minus one random

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,879
bits r one to r n minus one

87
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,239
computes rn at the exclusive or of s and

88
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,760
all the other a bits and now gives party

89
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,959
pi the share is a bit for i so for

90
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,799
correctness if all the parties

91
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,440
participate then they can

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,799
learn the secret by ignoring all the

93
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,440
the shares

94
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,959
and if

95
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,000
one

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,480
party missing then there will be a

97
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,280
random bit missing and we can prove that

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,480
they have

99
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,840
they have actually

100
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,599
a independent random bits

101
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,840
okay the share size in this scheme is

102
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,480
only a one a bit okay

103
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,280
so now we move to present our scheme for

104
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,320
arbitrary access structures

105
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,959
the secret is that we look at an access

106
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,358
structure gamma that has a minimal

107
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,040
override sets

108
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,600
so for every minimum of right set a of

109
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
size l

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,360
we independently execute

111
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,000
out the ascii and l out of l secret

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,520
chain scheme among the vertices in a

113
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,840
so for example for the following axis

114
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,600
structure

115
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,680
there is two minimal authorized sets p

116
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,199
one b two p one b three the third the

117
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,600
infrared set is not minimal so we

118
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,960
execute a two of a two out of two scheme

119
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,919
among the parties a p one a p two and

120
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,400
independently execute a two out of two

121
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,599
scheme among the aborted p1 and p3

122
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,840
so since each party can be in at

123
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,560
in up to two to the n a minimal

124
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,479
authorized set

125
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,560
said then the number at the shell scan

126
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,039
in size can be as large as the two to

127
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,600
the n this is what the best charge does

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,520
the shear size

129
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,080
known for realizing arbitrary axis

130
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,000
structures until a few years ago

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,639
so recently after more than 30 years of

132
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,440
research we have a bitter upper bound

133
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,160
for realizing arbitrary axis structures

134
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,360
so we have an upper bound of two to the

135
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,880
zero point five eight five and this

136
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,680
achieved by a sequence of uh

137
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,919
works started from 2017 and our last

138
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,440
result

139
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,199
was achieved in a paper that is

140
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,280
represented in this conference

141
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,080
when we look at lower bounds we know

142
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,360
that the best

143
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,759
known lower bound is due

144
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,479
the sensing is the 97 is a omega n

145
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,600
square over a logarithm so we can see

146
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
that there is a huge gap between the

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,960
best upper bound and the best lower band

148
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,840
we know at and it's a central opening

149
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,400
question in secret sharing to reduce

150
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,199
this

151
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,520
gap

152
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,240
okay this is what's a general secret

153
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,560
sharing now we will move to talk about

154
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,759
linear secret sharing which is a class

155
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,520
of skins

156
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,960
so this is an important class of schemes

157
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,280
due to reasons first the many of the

158
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,400
nonlinear

159
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,919
learners secretary schemes are linear

160
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,479
and second it has a

161
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,840
useful properties such as homomorphism

162
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,240
which is a critical for many some

163
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,599
applications such as a multi-party

164
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,319
computation

165
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,120
so this linear secret sharing is

166
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,880
constructed in a finite field f

167
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,360
the secret is one element in this in the

168
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,560
field and the randomness is the l a

169
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,280
is

170
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,240
not a finite number of field elements we

171
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,080
donated by l

172
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,880
which are uh chosen by e with uniform

173
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,520
distribution so for example here we the

174
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,319
leader chooses r1 and r2 with uniform

175
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,639
distribution in f3

176
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,520
uh

177
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,560
okay

178
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,240
so we say we defined in our sharing

179
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,039
we say that the sharing is linear if the

180
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,680
share is i is a vector

181
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,479
in

182
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,879
the field f the vector of c i elements

183
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,440
and each element in this vector is a

184
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,919
fixed combination of the secret and the

185
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,199
random bits so for example here p one is

186
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,919
given only one element which is r one

187
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,120
plus two r o two plus s and p two is

188
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,000
given

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,520
two random elements a r one and r a two

190
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
uh

191
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,360
we said that the linear reconstruction

192
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,560
is linear

193
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
if each of the right sets reconstruct

194
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,840
the secret using a linear function for

195
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,160
example p1 and p2

196
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,520
an authorized set computes the secret by

197
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,400
s11 minus s21 minus 2 is 2 2 this is a

198
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,039
linear combination

199
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,360
so we know that linear sharing is

200
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,919
equivalent to linear reconstruction this

201
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,599
is by a result by a very previous say

202
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,919
words

203
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,640
okay so now we talk about the previous

204
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,959
result in results in our secret sharing

205
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,519
so first the scheme that we presented in

206
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,600
the beginning of this talk is linear and

207
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,200
has the share size two to the n recently

208
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,000
after 30 years more than 30 years before

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,399
we have better upper bounds

210
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,800
the best about

211
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,800
known today is two to the zero point uh

212
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,080
five seven five seven five n

213
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
which is achieved in a paper in this

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,279
conference

215
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,839
and the best lower bound is uh two to

216
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,560
the n over two for explicit axis

217
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,399
structures we know a lower bound which

218
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,279
is two to the omega n

219
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,519
so we can see that the gap between the

220
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,519
best upper bound and this cover bound

221
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,680
and linear secret sharing is much

222
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,320
smaller than the gap in general is

223
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,800
secret sharing and this

224
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,839
motivates us to study in new

225
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,120
classes of a secret share

226
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,760
therefore we study a polynomial is

227
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,959
secret sharing

228
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,440
so polynomial secret sharing

229
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,680
winnex to present motivation the

230
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,640
definition represented in next slide so

231
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,120
polynomial secret sharing is a broader a

232
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,360
class of secret sharing

233
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,160
done in our schemes

234
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,320
in a previous work

235
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
previous work defines secret sharing

236
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,480
with a polynomial sharing and in our

237
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,040
our conceptual contribution is the

238
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,480
discussion of two additional uh

239
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,760
polynomial secret sharing a classes

240
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,200
uh so we introduce and discuss

241
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,320
schemes with a polynomial reconstruction

242
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,560
and the schemes with both polynomial

243
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,479
sharing and reconstruction

244
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,600
so the motivation in studying polynomial

245
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
is secret sharing first

246
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,760
improve lower bounds for a broader a

247
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,399
class of schemes and second

248
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
explore new techniques

249
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,880
for constructing efficient secret

250
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,200
sharing schemes therefore some or all

251
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,600
access structures exploiting the a

252
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,839
nice

253
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,680
algebraic structure of four of

254
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,560
polynomials

255
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,360
so next we define a polynomial a secret

256
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,680
sharing it's a polynomial secret

257
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,079
chaining is constructed in a finite

258
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,399
field

259
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,279
the secret is a an

260
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,640
element in

261
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,279
s which is a subset of the field for

262
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,720
example

263
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,440
is here we construct a scheme where is

264
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,839
all the field

265
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,120
fe3 the randomness is a finite number of

266
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,560
field elements donated by l

267
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,240
that are chosen with uniform

268
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,720
distribution so here the dealer it

269
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,440
chooses two random elements r1 and earth

270
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,360
2 with euro from distribution

271
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,200
with if we said that the sharing is

272
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,040
degree d sharing

273
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,959
if the share is

274
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,120
a the share of each party is a vector a

275
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,760
of ci elements in f

276
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,800
and each element in the in the share is

277
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,760
computed by the greedy polynomial of the

278
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,920
secret and the random bits

279
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,440
so here

280
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,040
p 1 is given to one element which is r1

281
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,560
plus r1 r2 squared plus s this is a

282
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,160
degree 3 polynomial p2 is given two

283
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,360
elements r1 and r2 this is a linear

284
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,560
okay so the greedy we say that this

285
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,880
reconstruction is degree d

286
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,360
if each authorized set reconstructs the

287
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,480
secret with a degree d polynomial so for

288
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,600
example p1 and p2 computes s11 minus s21

289
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,279
minus s21 is 2 2 square in order to

290
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,240
learn the secret this is a degree 3 a

291
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,720
polynomial

292
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,360
so we said that the signature is degree

293
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,480
d secret sharing if it has degree d

294
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,720
sharing and degrading reconstruction

295
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
okay this is was polynomial secret

296
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,639
sharing now we will talk about present

297
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,760
our results in polynomial secret chain

298
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,920
so in our first result we separate

299
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,480
between shear polynomial sharing and the

300
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,120
polynomial a reconstruction

301
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,079
so we prove that polynomial sharing does

302
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,040
not imply a polynomial reconstruction

303
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,279
this is improved under some

304
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,920
complex complexity assumption so in

305
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,800
order to prove this we show an efficient

306
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
secret sharing schemes that has a

307
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,560
polynomial sharing for an axis structure

308
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,360
that

309
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,720
under this assumption does not have a

310
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,120
secret sharing with a polynomial

311
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,000
reconstruction

312
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,800
we prove in our second result lower

313
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,360
bounds so we prove a lower bound of

314
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,399
omega 2 to the n over d plus 1 for

315
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,160
secret sharing with the greedy

316
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,000
reconstruction

317
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
and we prove a lower bound of t to the

318
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,120
omega n over d for secret sharing

319
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,760
schemes with the greedy reconstruction

320
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,720
for an

321
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,519
explicit access structure

322
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,680
so now we present our main result which

323
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,240
is about bounds for quadratic secret

324
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,600
sharing

325
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,920
so first quadratic secret sharing is

326
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,639
secret sharing with degradation to

327
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,519
sharing a degree to to sharing and

328
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,839
reconstruction

329
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,240
so in our main result we construct a

330
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,800
quadratic secret sharing scheme for

331
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,199
arbitrary axis structure that has shear

332
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,800
size 2 to the 0.705

333
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,560
n so this is

334
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,040
worse than a better than the best linear

335
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,519
scheme which requires share size 2 to

336
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,120
the

337
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,839
0.75 n however it's worse than the

338
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,399
nonlinear scheme which requires share

339
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,519
size due to the

340
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,000
0.585 n

341
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,320
also separate the secret quadratic

342
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,959
secret chaining for a and linear secret

343
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,440
sharing so we construct a quadratic

344
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,360
secret sharing for almost axis

345
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,800
structures with share size to 2 to the n

346
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,399
over e3

347
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,480
and by a lower bound

348
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,199
that we know and in our secret sharing

349
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,040
which is 2 to the n over 2 for realizing

350
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,399
realizing almost all axis structures we

351
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,480
get the

352
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,760
required saturation

353
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,040
okay so this is was

354
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,759
this was our results now we will move to

355
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,279
talk about uh our constructions

356
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,199
so as building a block in our

357
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,680
constructions we use a polynomial

358
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,959
conditional disclosure of secrets

359
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,360
so conditional disclosure of secret

360
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,320
there is a function f a boolean function

361
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,880
which with k n bots each input is in

362
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,480
domain n

363
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,120
there are guest servers if you want to

364
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,519
qk and each server has

365
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,040
a secret s and holds a comma randomness

366
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,240
r there is a referee the referee knows

367
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,000
all the inputs x 1 2 x k

368
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,959
and now it should be server it sends one

369
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,480
message to the referee such that uh when

370
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,639
sending the the each message of its

371
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,600
server depends on his in private input

372
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,480
on the secret s and on the common common

373
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,079
randomness r

374
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,720
the server does not see the inputs of

375
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,639
the other servers and does not see the

376
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,240
messages that

377
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,320
the other server send to the referee

378
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,600
so very correctness if the value of the

379
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,959
if if a function f is one then the

380
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,519
referee should learn the secret and if

381
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,600
the value is zero the referee should

382
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,360
learn nothing about the secret

383
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,039
okay so now we present a bar bound for

384
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,319
upper bounds for cds protocols

385
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,599
so for a function f with case in both

386
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,079
each input in domain n

387
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,000
we will have a linear case server cds

388
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,280
uh for if every function f with message

389
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,720
size and to the k minus one over two

390
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,039
this is a tight upper bound by a lower

391
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,960
bound proof in previous work

392
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,880
we also know there that there is a

393
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,320
non-linear cds protocol with k servers

394
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,360
for every function f with message size

395
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,000
due to the squared low k log n

396
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,960
we know that there is a quadratic cdsa

397
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,559
protocols with a two servers for every

398
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,280
function f with message size and to the

399
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,039
one over e3 so in our paper we construct

400
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,080
a quadratic kcdsu protocol with k

401
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
servers for every k

402
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,799
for every function f with message size

403
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,760
and to the k minus one over three

404
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,320
this is a tight upper bound by a lower

405
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,440
bound that

406
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,480
we we prove

407
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,559
okay this was the results in cbs

408
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,400
protocols now we we we moved to

409
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,840
the

410
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,799
uh

411
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,799
our ideas of our construction of cds

412
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,440
so first we present the road map of our

413
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,360
main result that we use

414
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,280
the cds in it

415
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,640
so we start by quadratic to server cds

416
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,440
from a previous work we transform this

417
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,039
protocol to quadratic case server cds we

418
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,120
represent the ideas of this

419
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,320
transformation in the next slide

420
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,120
then

421
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,480
we transform the quadratic server cds to

422
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,000
quadratic k server robust dds okay

423
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,280
robust cds is a new primitive that was

424
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,840
defined in the previous work

425
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,039
then from using using transformations

426
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,280
in

427
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,240
previous works of converting

428
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,880
cd robust cds to arbitrary secret

429
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,440
sharing for arbitrary access structures

430
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,400
we get our quadratic secret share

431
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,760
okay

432
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,480
now we will talk about our constructions

433
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,600
for s quadratic cds we start by

434
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,080
quadratic force server cds and they

435
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,120
present the ideas in this

436
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,640
protocol

437
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,960
so we want to construct a protocol for a

438
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,919
function f with four in both each input

439
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,679
is domain n

440
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,840
so in our protocol simulate the

441
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,200
quadratic to server cds of a previous

442
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
word for a function f

443
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,240
in which the first input is in domain n

444
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,559
and the second input is in domain into

445
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,080
the three

446
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,840
so there are two servers q one and q

447
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,840
q1 has inverted x and n y eq 2 has input

448
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,880
y and in in into the three so that each

449
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,960
chord you and

450
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,440
we look at the natural mapping of y to

451
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,000
the three coordinates y one y two y

452
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,080
three each coordinate is in n

453
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,200
there are common randomness s one is two

454
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,240
is three which are subsets of n

455
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,919
and now the sku1 sends a message of size

456
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,320
order n we will not describe the message

457
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,440
as is not relevant to our

458
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
ideas

459
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,400
now q2 sends three subsets a1 a2 and e3

460
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,919
such that if the secret is zero then a h

461
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,440
equals s h and if the secret is one then

462
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,640
a h equals s h x or y h

463
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,960
that means that if the

464
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,120
uh if y h is in s then we remove it and

465
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,120
if it's not then we add it

466
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,159
okay

467
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,039
so we have now at two additional servers

468
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,200
q3 and q4 the input of q2 is divided

469
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,559
among a then but y is divided among q2

470
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,559
q3 and q4

471
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,720
and now a server q2 cannot send

472
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,120
it to the sets a 2 and a 3 since a they

473
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
depend on

474
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,080
the inputs of u3 and q4

475
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,799
but he can send a one as it depends on

476
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,960
only in his inbox so he can

477
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,919
send

478
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,559
he sends a one q to similar q3 since a2

479
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,600
and the q4 sends a3

480
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,960
so the message in this protocol is order

481
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,039
n

482
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,760
now we present a

483
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,720
quadratic 7 server cdc protocol that

484
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,280
samuel s the previous protocol

485
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,240
so

486
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,039
now we want to construct a protocol for

487
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,760
function f with seven inputs each input

488
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,559
is in domain n

489
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,960
now we look you we want we simulate the

490
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,080
quadratic force server cds where

491
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,440
where the input of the first server is n

492
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,760
and the input of the other three servers

493
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,919
is in square

494
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,840
so we treat x2 and x3 as y1

495
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,559
and x4 at x5 as y2 x6 and x7 as y3 and

496
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,440
now we are back to the circulation of

497
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,679
for server cds

498
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,360
so q1 the server q1 sends the message of

499
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,640
the first server in the for server cds

500
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,520
which requires shares message size

501
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,960
and square and the other servers should

502
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,600
send those messages of the other three

503
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,960
servers in the first service server cds

504
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,240
so in order to do this

505
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,320
u2 and q3

506
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,320
execute a pcm protocol for sending s1 if

507
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,240
the secret is 0 and s1 x or y1 if the

508
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,559
secret is a

509
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,520
1.

510
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,080
so this means that

511
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,039
q2 sends one message q3 sends one

512
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,840
message and the referee should

513
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,640
learn

514
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,720
s1 or s1 x4 y1 without learning anything

515
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,600
about the secret and our technical

516
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,640
contribution is to show how to secure 2

517
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,840
and the q3 send the messages

518
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,080
similarly q4 and q5 execute bcm for

519
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,919
sending s2

520
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,600
and the q6 and q7 it would be simple to

521
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,840
call for

522
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,720
sc3

523
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,840
so the basin should be quadratic and we

524
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,120
show how to construct this say psn

525
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,039
so this is the protocol can be

526
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,919
generalized for every ak

527
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,880
using

528
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,679
the

529
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,960
psm this so our this so we have a

530
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,559
protocol for every ak

531
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,039
okay this was the ideas of our

532
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,480
constructions

533
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,120
and now we summarize and present open

534
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,880
egg problems

535
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,880
so we started bologna meal secret

536
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,799
sharing which is a broader class of

537
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,559
secret sharing schemes than the

538
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,760
willingness studies in our class

539
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,240
we improved lower bounds

540
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
for secret sharing with balloon

541
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,720
polynomial reconstruction we proved a

542
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,600
new upper bound of for quadratic secret

543
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,559
sharing and quadratic cds these upper

544
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,320
bounds are better than the best

545
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,880
non-linear upper bounds

546
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
we separated between linear and the

547
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,600
quadratic secret sharing for almost all

548
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,480
axis structures

549
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,960
now we discuss open problems so the

550
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,080
first question is to prove lower bounds

551
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,760
on the shear size

552
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,919
secret sharing schemes with degree d

553
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,799
sharing in our work we proved lower

554
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,960
bounds for secret chaining schemes with

555
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,520
degree de-reconstruction and it's

556
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,320
interesting to extend the lower bands to

557
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,760
degree d sharing

558
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,919
so we constructed which constructed

559
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,080
constructed the quadratic secret sharing

560
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,799
schemes and it's interesting to

561
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,039
construct the new degree d secret

562
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,679
sharing schemes that are better than the

563
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,000
quadratic secret sharing schemes that we

564
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,760
constructed

565
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,159
and perhaps the most

566
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,559
interesting question is to construct

567
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,640
efficient degree d secret sharing

568
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,440
schemes efficient could be

569
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,799
schemes with polynomial shares

570
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,039
so construct efficient degree d secret

571
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,600
sharing schemes for a larger class of

572
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,120
axis structures

573
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,159
uh then accesses the class of access

574
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,400
structures that we know that have

575
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,279
efficient linear secret sharing schemes

576
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,080
okay that's it thank you for your

577
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,080
attention
