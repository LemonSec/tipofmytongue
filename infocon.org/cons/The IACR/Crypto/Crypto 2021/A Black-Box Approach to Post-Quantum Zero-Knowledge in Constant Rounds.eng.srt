00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,319
hello everyone i'm takashi from ntt

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,560
today i will talk about the black box

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,400
approach to post quantum zero knowledge

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,920
in constant rounds

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,080
this is a joint work with anhuicha and

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,480
kaiminshan

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,160
their knowledge proofs and arguments are

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,039
fundamental primitive in cryptography

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,840
in those primitives approver tries to

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,240
convince the verifier of truth of some

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,279
statement

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,359
without revealing anything beyond the

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,840
truth of the statement itself

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,238
formally we require the following three

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,559
properties the first is completeness

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,800
which means that if the statement is

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,040
true and everything is done correctly

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,960
simplifier accepts with overwhelming

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,079
probability

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,559
second is the soundness which means that

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,079
the statement is false and then the fire

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,800
accepts uh with negligible probability

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,120
and especially when we consider

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,760
unbounded time cheating approval then we

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,399
call the protocol proofs and if we

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,960
consider a polynomial time output within

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
that is called arguments

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,559
and the cell property is the zero

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,920
knowledge property

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,799
which means that the fire learns nothing

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,680
beyond the fact that the statement is

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,360
the true statement

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,640
and next i will explain a more formal

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,920
definition of the knowledge property

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,320
so the analogy property is defined like

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,759
this

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,400
for any verifier there exists a

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,320
simulator the exist

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,799
for any distinguisher such that

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,360
distinguished doesn't distinguish

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,159
these two words the real world in the

42
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,880
real world will fire interact with the

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,320
honest river and in their ideal world

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
simulator simulates

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,479
the verified view

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,240
and especially when we consider

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,960
classical the marriage everything v s g

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,159
and oaks

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,520
is classical and when we consider uh

50
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,200
quantum denomination everything is

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,680
quantum

52
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,360
and especially we

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,439
consider the subgraph of the knowledge

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,439
called black boxes marriage

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,280
the difference from the

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,878
normal the marriage is that the

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,800
simulator here

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,760
uses

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,800
the verifier only in a black box manner

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
and here are several reasons why we

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
study black book zero marriage

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,440
first most known protocols satisfy black

63
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,480
box knowledge second there are very few

64
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,800
non-black box simulation techniques and

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,680
third

66
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,599
protocols with non-black boxes knowledge

67
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,160
are usually far from practical

68
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,120
so

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
for those reasons

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,519
it is very important to study uh the

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,720
power and the limitations of black boxer

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
knowledge

73
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,840
and especially uh what we consider in

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,720
this work is post quantum data knowledge

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,040
positive quantum zero knowledge protocol

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,200
is a classical protocol

77
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,959
with quantum zero knowledge and

78
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,599
especially we focus on those for np

79
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,200
languages

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,080
and because we already know a lot of

81
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,319
contractions of classical large

82
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,920
particles for np so one may think that

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,000
we can obtain positive quantum zero

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,080
knowledge by just replacing the

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,599
assumptions with post-content

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,280
assumptions in those classical

87
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,440
constructions however

88
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,760
in general this doesn't work

89
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,400
because of the usage of rewinding

90
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,120
technique that is often used in the

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
classical

92
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,519
security proofs

93
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,120
and

94
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,560
i'd like to review non-contractions of

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,319
classical and the past quantum zero

96
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,720
narrative protocols and i remark that

97
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,280
this is not exhaustive list of the known

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,879
contractions and this is just uh

99
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,040
related most related work through our

100
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,000
work

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,720
the first and or sorry first the

102
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,599
knowledge proof for np languages was uh

103
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,920
proposed by uh gold right here maker

104
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,480
reduction and this is based on one

105
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,360
function however the round complexity of

106
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,439
this protocol is polynomial

107
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,920
so after that it is one of the most

108
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,159
important research topic in the marriage

109
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,439
to reduce

110
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,680
the number of rounds

111
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,280
and at the constant rounds uh there were

112
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,720
protocols by

113
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,798
gaurav kahn and

114
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,079
bellare jakobson yen and this is five

115
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,840
rounds based on collision relations hash

116
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,759
and this is four round based on one

117
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,720
function and this is only argument

118
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,040
so this is the state of art

119
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,880
in the classical setting

120
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,080
however uh it it is not immediately

121
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,360
clear if these contractions

122
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,600
uh also also satisfy quantum zero

123
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,560
knowledge uh even if we use post quantum

124
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,120
assumptions

125
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,080
for that direction the first progress

126
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,000
was made by waters in 2005 so he proved

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,840
that

128
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,759
many known construction of classical

129
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,440
genetic protocol

130
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,759
actually also satisfy

131
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,720
quantum zero marriage if we use quantum

132
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,199
assumptions post quantum assumptions and

133
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,639
as a result he obtained

134
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,199
the knowledge quantum post quantum zero

135
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,800
knowledge proof

136
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,400
for based on

137
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,240
post quantum functions

138
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,280
however

139
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,840
his technique is only applicable to

140
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
protocol with polynomial number of

141
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,360
rounds so

142
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,400
after that it has it has been a

143
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,880
long-standing open problem to construct

144
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,720
constant round post-quantum zero

145
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,720
knowledge proofs or even arguments

146
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,520
this open problem was recently solved by

147
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
bitansky and shimely

148
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,919
they constructed constant round post

149
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,360
quantum zero knowledge argument

150
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
however there are several

151
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,120
caveats

152
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,440
in their contraction first their

153
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,000
construction is the argument and so it

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,039
only satisfy computational soundness

155
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,880
second uh there

156
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,680
they rely on some novel non-black box

157
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,759
simulation technique which means that

158
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,600
their protocol is not black boxer

159
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,720
knowledge

160
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,319
third the assumption is rather strong

161
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,440
their

162
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,080
the quantum hardness of lwe and the

163
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,520
existence of

164
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,440
quantum fully homomorphic encryption

165
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,120
therefore

166
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,000
we ask the following question in this

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,880
work

168
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,800
their constant random post-content black

169
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,639
book theoretical protocols

170
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,960
hopefully with statistical soundness

171
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
from weak assumptions

172
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,720
and this is our results

173
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,440
we construct post-quantum black boxes

174
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,520
knowledge proofs and arguments from

175
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,840
weaker assumptions at the cost of

176
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,680
weakening their knowledge to what is

177
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,919
called epsilon zero knowledge

178
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,240
which i will explain later

179
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,400
and especially we construct two

180
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,280
protocols the first is proofs from

181
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
collapsing hash function

182
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
which is the quantum counterpart of

183
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,880
collision relations hash function

184
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,240
introduced by owner and the second is

185
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,479
argument from one function

186
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,599
and the

187
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,960
here i would like to remark that our

188
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,440
follow for up work shows the

189
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,080
impossibility of constant round post

190
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,560
quantum black box energy for np and the

191
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
reasonable assumption

192
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
therefore

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,599
weakening the knowledge property is

194
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,520
unavoidable for obtaining blockbuster

195
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,000
now in constant rounds so this follow-up

196
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,240
work justifies

197
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,479
the weakening of the nourishment

198
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,880
knowledge

199
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,120
so this is the comparison table among

200
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,160
known constructions and our contractions

201
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,280
so as i said the collapsing hash

202
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,759
function is a quantum counterpart of

203
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,479
collision resistance hash function so

204
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,720
given the similarity our first

205
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,360
contraction is very similar to

206
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
what is achieved by gold rahika hand

207
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,680
protocol and actually

208
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,400
uh our first contraction is almost the

209
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,520
same construction as the goliath hand

210
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,960
contraction except that we use uh

211
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,638
post-quantum building blocks

212
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,599
so now i'd like to explain why it's in

213
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,319
their marriage but before that

214
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,120
let's recall the definition of the

215
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,599
standard language property so the black

216
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,599
box knowledge property

217
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,599
says that the difference between these

218
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,279
two probabilities

219
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,159
is upper bounded by negligible function

220
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,799
by the definition of negligible function

221
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,760
this is

222
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,600
equivalent to this

223
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,480
for any inverse polynomial epsilon

224
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,240
this is abundant by epsilon

225
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,720
and the epsilon zero marriage is

226
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,760
obtained by a slightly changing uh the

227
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
order of quantifiers

228
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,600
that is uh epsilon comes before

229
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
s

230
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,600
this means that the simulator can

231
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,680
depend on

232
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,720
under epsilon and so this awakens the

233
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,120
requirement

234
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,160
however

235
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,399
we like to claim that epsilon zero

236
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,720
knowledge is just below the standard

237
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,800
zero knowledge in the hierarchy of

238
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,600
variance of ternary properties for the

239
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,480
following

240
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,600
reasons

241
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,480
first uh if synthetic knowledge implies

242
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
weaker notions of the knowledge such as

243
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,040
weakness indicability which is hiding

244
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,680
and so on and the second ips in the

245
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,279
knowledge is sufficient for many

246
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,680
game-based security applications and

247
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,080
third achieving absentee knowledge is

248
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
usually as hard as achieving their

249
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,399
knowledge in the classical setting

250
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,480
and for the reasons we believe that

251
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,279
episode zero knowledge is very mild

252
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,440
relaxation of the zero knowledge

253
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
property

254
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
so from now i would like to

255
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,720
move on to the technical part and

256
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,560
those we

257
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,200
proposed two contractions but in this

258
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
talk i focus on the first construction

259
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,560
and our first first contraction

260
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,880
is almost the same as the goal right

261
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,839
vehicle contraction as i mentioned and

262
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,600
that contraction is based on sigma

263
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,399
protocol so let's start from signal

264
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,680
protocol so sigma protocol is a three

265
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,000
round interactive protocol that

266
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,240
satisfies the following three properties

267
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,320
the first two are just standard

268
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,880
completeness and hardness and the third

269
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,680
property is called spatial honest

270
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,240
verifier zero knowledge

271
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,200
so

272
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,600
this means that for any fixed e

273
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,079
the transcript can be simulated by a

274
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,959
simulator uh given e

275
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,440
so remark that this is different from

276
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
the general standard zero knowledge

277
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,680
because when we consider a general

278
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,720
malicious verifier the b5 can choose e

279
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,760
depending on a so we cannot fix e at

280
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,640
first so this means that if

281
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,760
we know the fire sends some particular e

282
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,920
in advance then we can simulate the

283
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,479
transcript

284
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,160
and the gol raki kahan protocol

285
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,040
is

286
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,399
is based on the sigma protocol and they

287
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,839
added some additional commitment by the

288
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,560
fire to make the protocol

289
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,240
their knowledge against general verifier

290
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,600
so the idea is to let the verifier

291
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,240
commit to the the e at the beginning and

292
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,600
then a simulator can first rewind

293
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,920
verified to extract e

294
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,279
and after that e is already committed so

295
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,920
simulator can use that extracted e to

296
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,079
simulate the transcript of the sigma

297
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,120
protocol part and then it can accomplish

298
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,680
the task of simulation

299
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,880
however

300
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,399
the problem is that in if

301
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,959
fire is content

302
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,800
then this rewinding doesn't work because

303
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,680
when the simulator rewinds very fire the

304
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,480
fire's internal state may collapse and

305
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,360
so the fire may not may not go back to

306
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,600
the original state so this is a problem

307
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,839
in the quantum setting

308
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,959
and in spite of this difficulty uh we

309
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,800
managed to prove that

310
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,560
this protocol

311
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
is uh quantum

312
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,440
epsilon zero knowledge by using novel

313
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,240
proof technique

314
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,800
towards quantum simulation we first make

315
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,720
the following observation

316
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,240
suppose that the following two

317
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,760
assumptions hold

318
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,959
first er is information theoretically

319
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,959
determined from the commitment and

320
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,760
second we never avoid

321
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,800
then we can rewind v without collapsing

322
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,560
its internal state

323
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,720
the reason is that if

324
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,000
these assumptions hold then er

325
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,480
sent in this round is

326
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,959
already determined in advance and such

327
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,839
deterministic quantum computation can be

328
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,880
done

329
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,360
without collapsing the state in general

330
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,399
and so

331
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,279
in this case we can rewind the fire

332
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,680
without collapsing its internal state

333
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,920
and this was already observed in

334
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,320
bizansky and she may work

335
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,560
and for the item run

336
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,519
this can be achieved by just requiring a

337
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,320
commitment to be strict binding

338
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,480
further definition is exactly the item

339
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,519
one

340
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,399
and

341
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,199
this requirement can be relaxed to what

342
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,079
is called strong collapse binding which

343
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,160
can be seen as a computational version

344
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
of strict binding

345
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
and we know that such a commitment can

346
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,839
be constructed based on collapsing hash

347
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,120
function

348
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,560
and this is the only assumption we use

349
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,079
and uh i collapsed uh

350
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,240
so the details about the definition of

351
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,399
collapse binding is not very important

352
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,240
for the rest of this talk so i will omit

353
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,199
this

354
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,000
and for the second item two this is a

355
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,120
significant restriction of v because of

356
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,079
for proving the knowledge property we

357
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,079
have to consider a malicious verifier

358
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,240
that sometimes a vote

359
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,680
and so the main technical difficulty is

360
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,320
to deal with such a fire that sometimes

361
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,720
a boat

362
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,199
to deal with such a

363
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,000
malicious verifier that sometimes a boat

364
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,560
we first rely on the simplifying trick

365
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,199
introduced by bitansky and shimeli

366
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,079
the idea is to guess whether we are both

367
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,199
or not

368
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,680
so suppose that we have two simulators

369
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,920
that work conditioned on

370
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,199
v about and doesn't abort respectively

371
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,880
and

372
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,040
then by randomly running either of these

373
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,760
two two simulators we get a simulator

374
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,480
that works with probability one half

375
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,880
because the probability that the gate is

376
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,320
correct is a one-half

377
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,760
and

378
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,040
by the waters rewinding lemma a such a

379
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,440
simulator that works with probability

380
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,079
one half can be converted into a full

381
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,239
phase simulator that always succeed

382
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,399
by using this trick

383
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,759
our task is reduced to contracting two

384
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,480
simulators for aborting and non-avoiding

385
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,959
cases separately

386
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,399
first let's consider the bowling case

387
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,160
so in the boiling case

388
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,560
actually the simulation is very easy

389
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,600
because

390
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,800
when verifying above the prover

391
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,880
doesn't need to send the final message v

392
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,920
in that case the simulator only has to

393
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,880
simulate a which is the first message of

394
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,399
the same protocol

395
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,959
and the first message of sigma protocol

396
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,759
can be simulated without using weakness

397
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,800
and so

398
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,399
this case is very easy

399
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,040
so why is nontrivial is the non-avoiding

400
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,000
case

401
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,480
so in the non-erotic case the verifier

402
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,399
doesn't evolve so prover has to send z

403
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,160
which means that simulator also has to

404
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,920
shim led z

405
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,959
and and for simulating z uh simulator

406
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,519
has to somehow extract e

407
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,480
but in the extraction it has it should

408
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,880
not collapse the verified state too much

409
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,440
so this is the difficulty and we will

410
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,079
explain i've explained how to resolve

411
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:44,880
this

412
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,519
difficulty

413
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,199
so for explaining our idea uh let's

414
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,120
first consider the following toy example

415
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,720
so

416
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,000
suppose that verify your internal state

417
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,399
after sending commitment

418
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,039
is psi which is the sum of two

419
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,199
orthogonal states psi a and psi n a

420
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,760
and suppose verifier

421
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,160
performs some projection

422
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,959
perform projection to psi a and if the

423
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,119
projection succeeds it aborts and

424
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,520
otherwise doesn't abort

425
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,319
and

426
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,199
let's think about what happens if we try

427
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,240
to

428
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,360
extract e from this verifier

429
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,840
so the simulator first runs the verifier

430
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,240
until it sends er

431
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,160
assuming that it doesn't abort

432
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,640
then the verified internal state

433
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,679
collapses to psi and a and at this point

434
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,320
this state is different from the

435
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,640
original state psi and we don't know how

436
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,120
to go back to the original state

437
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,080
so

438
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,080
one may think that the simulation gets

439
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,600
stuck at this point

440
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,200
however

441
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,240
our key observation is that such a

442
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,120
collapsing also happens in the real

443
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,039
execution in the non-aborting case

444
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,840
therefore this collapsing doesn't matter

445
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,080
for simulation of non-operating case

446
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,640
because recall that we

447
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,440
are now constructing a simulator that is

448
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,080
only required to work in the normal

449
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,400
voting case so this collapsing is

450
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,799
actually fine for that simulator so this

451
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,919
is our

452
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,760
very our key of the vision

453
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,919
so for generating the idea to the

454
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,960
general case we rely on jolin's lemma

455
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,880
which is a commonly used lemma in

456
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,840
quantum er information theory so this

457
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,559
letter gives us a decomposition

458
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,160
of verified internal space

459
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,520
into two orthogonal subspaces that

460
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,000
satisfy the following

461
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,760
uh let's denote the first subspace

462
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,039
component by psi smaller than epsilon

463
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,400
and the second subspace component by psi

464
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,039
larger than equal to epsilon

465
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,520
and the meaning of this notation is the

466
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,320
following uh if the fire only has the

467
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,200
first subspace component then it doesn't

468
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,120
abort with probability smaller than

469
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,320
epsilon

470
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,280
and if

471
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,080
it only has a second subspace component

472
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,160
then it doesn't evolve with probability

473
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
larger than or equal to epsilon and

474
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,520
moreover these states in the different

475
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,400
subspaces do not interfere with each

476
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,320
other

477
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,240
and the lemma especially ensure that if

478
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,360
the fire internal state only has the

479
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,160
second subspace component then that

480
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,799
remains in the subspace

481
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,200
even if we apply arbitrary number of

482
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,600
rewinding of the verifier

483
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,760
based on this observation

484
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,480
we can extract e

485
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,760
with overwriting probability by order of

486
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,640
epsilon inverse times rewinding

487
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,200
if a verified internal state only has a

488
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,600
second subspace component

489
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,720
and moreover a such almost deterministic

490
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,480
quantum computation

491
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,039
can be done almost without collapsing

492
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,760
the internal state in general therefore

493
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,480
if as verify only has

494
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,440
the second subspace component then

495
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,240
we can extract e without

496
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,320
almost without collapsing

497
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,520
the state

498
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,720
however in general uh belfair also has

499
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,440
the first subspace component and this

500
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,960
state may collapse in an unexpected way

501
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,159
however our observation is that this

502
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,360
doesn't matter because this state

503
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,480
almost vanishes in the real execution

504
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,559
conditioned or not aborting

505
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,400
similarly to

506
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,360
our previous toy example

507
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
and if we can set epsilon to be

508
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
negligible then we would be able to

509
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,120
prove the standard zero knowledge

510
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,480
however because uh our rewinding

511
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,919
procedure needs order of epsilon inverse

512
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,799
times rewinding so we can only set

513
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,520
epsilon to be inverse polynomial

514
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,039
though if we can set that to be

515
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,360
arbitrary small inverse polynomial and

516
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,760
this is why we can only achieve epsilon

517
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,919
zero knowledge rather than

518
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,039
the standard deviation

519
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,919
so this is the summary of

520
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,640
how to construct our simulator

521
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,159
so first we construct two simulators

522
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,039
that

523
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:39,919
works

524
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,679
in the boarding case and no aborting

525
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,159
case respectively and the aborting case

526
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,919
simulator is trivial and the

527
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,840
non-aborting case simulator is

528
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,400
constructed by the combination of

529
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
jordan's glamour and cryptographic

530
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,559
techniques such as collapsed binding

531
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,520
commitments and based on the bitansky

532
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,240
and shimely trick we combine these two

533
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,000
simulators to obtain a simulator with

534
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
success probability one

535
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,440
one half

536
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,880
and finally we rely on water's

537
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,480
rewinding lemma

538
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,679
to

539
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,159
convert this into full-fledged simulator

540
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,720
and and as i mentioned the non-avoiding

541
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,039
case simulator has epsilon simulation

542
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,919
error and this is inherited to this and

543
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,159
also this and this is why our financial

544
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,280
simulator

545
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,679
only achieved epsilon zero knowledge

546
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,320
simulation

547
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
this is the summary of this work or we

548
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,600
gave two constructions of black box

549
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,480
epsilon zero nourish protocols and the

550
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,440
first contraction is proofs based on

551
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,840
collapsing hash functions and the second

552
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,159
contraction is arguments based on one

553
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,600
function

554
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,360
this is the end of my talk thank you for

555
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,840
your attention
