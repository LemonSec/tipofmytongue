00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,040
hi everyone my name is khan i'm a pg

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,919
student at ibm recently and eth zurich

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,240
and today i'm going to talk about smile

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,480
set membership from idea lattices with

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,240
applications to ring signatures and

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,560
confidential transactions so this is

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,240
joint work with vadim liboshevsky and

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,880
gregor scila

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,640
okay let's start with what the set

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,599
membership proof is it is pretty simple

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,160
so we have here we have an interesting

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,800
example suppose we have a set s which

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,520
consists of four socks the green one red

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,520
one blue one and the yellow the orange

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,399
one and we want to prove that we have a

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,320
sock which is in one of these colors

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,440
without revealing which color it is

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,920
so let's say it's green

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,320
so formally we basically just want to

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,120
prove knowledge of an element small s

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,440
which belongs to the big set s which is

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,719
public

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,879
and we want to prove knowledge of such

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,640
such an element without revealing any

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,760
information

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,800
about

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,680
which element it is

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,840
so the applications of the cell

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,880
membership proof can be

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,119
can be as follows well it can be easily

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,119
transformed into a one out of many proof

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,400
defined by

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,119
growth and cold vice

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,360
so this is type of proof where

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,200
we want to prove

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,759
that one of the elements of the set is a

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,439
commitment to zero and it

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,280
there is a straightforward

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,439
application to ring signatures because

40
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,360
public keys especially in the lattice

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360
setting the public keys can be

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,079
thought of as commitments to xero and

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,159
then from rigged signatures

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,000
there are these applications to

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,920
confidential transactions as well as

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,399
electronic voting

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,000
so in terms of lattice-based ring

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,360
signatures

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
um

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,640
well the best scheme up to date

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,520
uh which follows that framework or this

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520
path from the previous slide

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,000
is the scheme by asking at all

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,560
which has a pretty nice

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,000
signature sizes so even for large sizes

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,760
like two to 21 users it is below 150

57
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,200
kilobytes

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,879
then um more recently at age crypt 2020

59
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,879
we have the falafel scheme

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,800
which

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,680
which proposes this new logarithmic size

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,200
or proof

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,760
and the the size for

64
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,080
221 users is even less than 40 kilobytes

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,959
so um so yeah so just one i just wanted

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,879
to mention that asymptotically these two

67
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,040
uh schemes are logarithmic

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,599
in size of the of the ring

69
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,360
then we also have the raptor scheme

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,599
which as you can see for even for two to

71
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,680
the twelve users it's five megabytes

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,000
which kind of suggests that it is

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,160
it scales linearly in the number of

74
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,080
users

75
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,040
and in this work we propose a ring

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,959
signature let's base ring signature

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,879
which follows the the path from the

78
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,480
previous slide and we even for like big

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,840
bring uh like to the 21

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,599
uh we achieved 22 around 22 kilobytes

81
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,680
so what i wanted to mention is that this

82
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,519
is really an active area of current

83
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,400
research

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,920
because there are

85
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,680
in in this conference at crypto 2021

86
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,200
there are two more lattice based ring

87
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,760
signatures so the first one

88
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,440
um proposes short signature sizes for

89
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,120
for small rings

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,680
of size between four and two thousand

91
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,319
uh at the time of recording this

92
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,959
this paper is not available on eprint

93
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,319
yet

94
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,680
but uh

95
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,720
but the abstract suggests that

96
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,640
that the size scales linearly uh

97
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,879
in the number of users

98
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,200
and then we also have the second

99
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,280
the second construction

100
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,920
of ring signature from plain lwe in the

101
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
standard model

102
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,799
so i just wanted to mention these two

103
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,200
other papers

104
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,439
so in terms of our contributions i kind

105
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,280
of explicitly mentioned them so the core

106
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
part or the technical contribution of

107
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,839
this paper is definitely the this new

108
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,478
lattice-based set membership proof

109
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,560
which can then

110
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,199
be turned easily into a logarithmic size

111
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,720
ring signature

112
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,759
and then later on we follow the uh the

113
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,479
matrix framework defined by skin at all

114
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,800
at ccs 2019

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,479
and we construct a monero like

116
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,880
confidential transaction system

117
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,440
so in terms of the proof size

118
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,360
we reduce it by a factor of 4 to 10

119
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,320
times

120
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,080
but

121
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,000
but please look at the the paper for

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,759
more details about about the

123
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,160
confidential transaction system

124
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,520
because in this presentation we will

125
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,280
focus on this technical contribution

126
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
which is this new

127
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,479
lattice based of membership proof

128
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,240
okay so let's start with uh with our

129
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,440
approach

130
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,880
so um

131
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,400
so yeah so let's go back to our

132
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
interesting example

133
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,080
so suppose we have the green sock and we

134
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,400
want to prove that it is it belongs to

135
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,160
that set s

136
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,479
so what we do at the beginning is that

137
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,360
well

138
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,320
we put all these um all these elements

139
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,360
of the set s into a matrix so in this

140
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,520
case we have four columns the matrix

141
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,000
with four columns

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,520
and then we can define the index vector

143
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,360
v so in this

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,400
here is

145
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,080
0 1 0 0 such that this matrix multiplied

146
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,800
by this vector 0 1 0 0 is equal to this

147
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,600
green sock that we have

148
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,759
so yeah so more formally we have this

149
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,360
matrix which

150
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
which each column corresponds to an

151
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,960
element of the set

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,000
times the index vector

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,360
where

154
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,160
it is one in the i position so suppose

155
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,560
we have this element as i

156
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,120
and it is zero in all the other entries

157
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,039
and then we end up with this matrix

158
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,720
times the index vector is equal to s i

159
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,199
so for notational purposes let this

160
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,800
index vector be

161
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,919
v and

162
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,280
we call this public matrix p

163
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,840
so equivalently we basically write it as

164
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,359
p times v equal to s i

165
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,039
right so the naive solution

166
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,440
can be thought of as follows so

167
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,199
this solution is i'm not saying that

168
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,199
it's completely bad because it it might

169
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,120
be good for small

170
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,400
ring sizes

171
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,720
like 32 let's say

172
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,800
but uh let's see we will see this it's

173
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,360
it's disadvantages later on

174
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,560
um okay so we first commit to v

175
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,720
and the s i

176
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,160
and then we prove

177
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,479
that p v is equal to s i so this is this

178
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,919
equation uh

179
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,520
the previous equation right so um

180
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
as you can see this equation

181
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,319
it is basically a simple linear relation

182
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,319
right because we commit to v we commit

183
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,880
to s i and this is just a

184
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,800
linear relation between the committed

185
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,400
messages

186
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,280
so i will call it linear relation

187
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
but then we also have to prove that v is

188
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,520
well defined so what does it mean it

189
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,440
means that we have to prove that it has

190
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,599
the zero one entries

191
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,560
and it has exactly one one

192
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
and we do it as follows we prove that v

193
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,199
has binary zero one coefficients which

194
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,240
can be

195
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,400
what which which can be thought of as

196
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,360
v times v minus one is equal to zero

197
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,039
where this multiplication is the

198
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,000
component-wise multiplication

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,759
and proving this equation is just a

200
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,759
multiplicative relation

201
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,080
on the committed messages because v is

202
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,520
committed again

203
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,280
and then to prove that

204
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,080
v has exactly one one we prove this

205
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,720
simple linear relation meaning well the

206
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,840
matrix which consists of one row of ones

207
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,599
times v must be equal to one

208
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,680
and now to prove all these linear and

209
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,599
multiplicative relations we can apply

210
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,479
this

211
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,960
i will call it the lanes framework

212
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,520
so the the names well each letter

213
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,319
corresponds to an author of

214
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,919
of paper which contributes to the

215
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,639
framework with and it starts by the

216
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,240
paper by atema at all at crypto 2020

217
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,479
they uh so this framework allows us to

218
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,479
prove efficiently

219
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,360
in terms of concrete sizes

220
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,279
uh proving linear and multiplicative

221
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,679
relations

222
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,640
um

223
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,440
so

224
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,479
what's

225
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,600
wrong with this what's well what are the

226
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
weaknesses of this approach well

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,519
we will need to commit to the whole

228
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,480
vector v of length n

229
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,200
so if we consider big and like well big

230
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,399
size

231
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,920
uh or sets of well of

232
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,640
length or size let's say um

233
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,160
2 to the 20

234
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,680
then this method does not really

235
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
work well

236
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,880
in terms of efficiency

237
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,399
and um

238
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,200
well by applying the lens framework

239
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,160
um we end up with actually the big o of

240
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,440
n proof size basically linear

241
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,640
proof size

242
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,600
and then yeah so as i said if we if we

243
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,519
consider like big

244
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,640
big sets

245
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,240
or later on like

246
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,120
ring signatures with two to the 20 users

247
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
then this approach basically would suck

248
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,080
so

249
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,080
how to make it more efficient let's say

250
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,640
so in order to achieve logarithmic

251
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,680
size

252
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,399
we applied the the trick which was

253
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,240
used in may previous works starting from

254
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,640
growth at call called vice

255
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
and butto at all

256
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,959
so suppose that n which is the size of

257
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,920
the set is equal to l to the m

258
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,320
and then there is this observation that

259
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,120
the vector v this index vector v

260
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,600
which has exactly one one and the rest

261
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,680
are zeros can be uniquely

262
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,880
tensor decomposed into smaller vectors v

263
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,399
one v two up to v n where each v j

264
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,760
is binary and has exactly one one

265
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,360
so each v j is of length l and there are

266
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,120
m of them

267
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,560
so um

268
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
so first of all

269
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,880
this operation is not very well defined

270
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
so what we mean is that

271
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,240
this is v1 tensor and then the the

272
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,040
bracket and then v2 tensor and then the

273
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,519
bracket v3 tensor and the bracket and so

274
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,959
on up to

275
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,800
well at the end it's going to be v n

276
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,760
minus 1 tensor v m

277
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,240
so let's just have quick examples

278
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,000
so if we have 0 0 1 0 then we can write

279
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,200
it as 0 1 tensor 1 0

280
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,720
and a little bit more complicated

281
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,839
example

282
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,480
if we have the vector zero zero one and

283
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,560
then all zeros basically one is in the

284
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,120
third position then we can decompose it

285
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,640
as one zero

286
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,800
tensor and then the brackets zero one

287
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,200
tensor 1 0

288
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,240
so

289
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,480
basically the observation is that

290
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,240
every vector

291
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,920
every such vector v

292
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
every index vector

293
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,160
which satisfies these conditions can be

294
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,760
decomposed in this way

295
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,320
okay so the solution the logarithmic

296
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,920
size solution can be

297
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,480
can be described as follows so we commit

298
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,440
to v1 up to vm so we commit to these

299
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
smaller decompositions there are m of

300
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,880
them

301
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,079
and then what as well as si

302
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,399
and then instead of proving p v is equal

303
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,279
to s i we have to prove that p of this

304
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,760
tensor product of v 1 v 2 up to v m is

305
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,360
equal to s i

306
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,279
and this is definitely not a linear

307
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,760
relation

308
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,839
next we have to prove that each vj is

309
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,120
well defined

310
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,639
so

311
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,959
well which is basically similar as as

312
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,200
before so we have to prove that v j has

313
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,680
binary zero one coefficients

314
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,480
uh which means v j times v j minus one

315
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,800
is zero which is just a multiplicative

316
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,839
relation

317
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,120
and then

318
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,040
we want to prove that v j has exactly

319
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,480
one one

320
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,079
and we do that by proving that

321
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,000
well

322
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,399
that's the matrix which consists of one

323
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,880
row of ones times v j is equal to one

324
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,519
so as you can see this um this solution

325
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,680
is much better than the previous one

326
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,959
because

327
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:45,680
we

328
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
only

329
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,040
well we commit to the smaller vectors

330
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,600
vjs and not to the whole

331
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,880
v

332
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,399
and uh

333
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,240
well hopefully i can convince you that

334
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,639
it's more successful

335
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,920
solution but the last thing but the one

336
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,079
thing to describe is well how to

337
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,920
actually prove this type of equation

338
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,240
because it is not a linear equation so

339
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,560
okay so let's

340
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,639
let's have a look at the intuition so in

341
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,279
order to prove that type of equation so

342
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,839
p times so the matrix times the tensor

343
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,560
product equal to something we will use

344
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,920
the following two facts so first of all

345
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,399
we need to prove that the inner product

346
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,720
of pv well i mean there's nothing to

347
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,079
prove but i mean this is a simple

348
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,279
observation

349
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,040
um we want to

350
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,240
uh

351
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,839
the first observation is that the inner

352
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,320
product of pv and w

353
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,399
for vectors v and w

354
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,120
is equal to the vector into the inner

355
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,399
product of v and then p transpose w

356
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,560
so this is a very simple observation but

357
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,680
this is a

358
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,720
key

359
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,639
component of uh

360
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,120
of proving linear relations in the

361
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
in the framework in the lens framework

362
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,639
and um

363
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,639
yeah especially in this this paper by

364
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,279
eskin at al at euro at asia crypt 2020

365
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,600
and then um the second fact is that if

366
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,560
you

367
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,360
if we have the vectors uv

368
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,880
then uh the inner product of this tensor

369
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,639
product of u and v

370
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,240
with w can be written as follows so the

371
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,000
first step

372
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,920
is just the definition of this tensor

373
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,079
product as u1 times v then u2 times v

374
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,199
and then ul times v

375
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,560
this w which has length l squared in

376
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,199
this particular example can be written

377
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,000
as

378
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,959
can be split into smaller vectors w1

379
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,399
which has length l

380
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,760
w2 which has length l up to wl which has

381
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,320
length l

382
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,199
okay so this first step is pretty clear

383
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,000
and then from this from this step to

384
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,920
well yeah from to explain this equality

385
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,079
we have to notice that

386
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,560
we use this observation or basically

387
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,399
it's a simple

388
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,000
fact that

389
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,600
the inner product of u1 times v

390
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,440
and w1 is

391
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,040
u1 u1 is a constant that's the number is

392
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,440
u1 times

393
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,480
the inner product of v and w1

394
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,360
so that's why we we can

395
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,680
take u1 u2 up to ul on the one side

396
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,759
and we end up with the inner product of

397
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,839
u1 u2 up to ul

398
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:34,880
and

399
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,839
with the vector which which is equal to

400
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,720
the inner product of w1 then inner

401
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,680
product of v and w2 and then the inner

402
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,079
product of v and wl

403
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,440
so uh

404
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,160
so actually there is not much magic

405
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,360
going on here it's just just a

406
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,440
calculation and just

407
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,759
moving around all these vectors and

408
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,680
constants

409
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,639
okay so if when we are in this step

410
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,880
then uh well i can just write it as the

411
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,720
u then the vector u

412
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,800
and then i can write this vector as the

413
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
matrix vector product

414
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,920
where

415
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,560
well where the matrix is

416
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,079
this matrix where the rows are v1 v2 up

417
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,600
to vl

418
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,440
oh sorry and then

419
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,839
and this matrix is multiplied by the

420
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,600
vector v so let me call this matrix w

421
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,720
so at the end at the end we end up

422
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,160
with

423
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,839
the inner product of u tensor v with w

424
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
equal to inner product of u and this

425
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,839
matrix w times v

426
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,440
okay so we will use these two facts

427
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,040
so um so the intuition is as follows for

428
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,199
simplicity suppose that this

429
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,839
that the set s consists of vectors over

430
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,040
z q

431
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,240
so let's say these vectors have length k

432
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,560
and you know in order to prove that to

433
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,839
prove this equation so p times v 1 v

434
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,280
tensor v 2 up to v m is equal to s i

435
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,240
we prove that for a random challenge

436
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,799
vector picked by the verifier

437
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,439
we prove that the inner product of

438
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,079
p times the tensor product of these v

439
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,520
i's v j's

440
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,839
minus s i

441
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,480
with gamma which will be the challenge

442
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,760
vector is equal to zero

443
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,919
okay so

444
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,600
so how to prove that how to prove that

445
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,080
this inner product is zero so first of

446
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,880
all

447
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,090
we

448
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,240
[Music]

449
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,039
well

450
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,360
i don't know the first thing is to split

451
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,120
this in the product so this inner

452
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,640
product can be written as the inner

453
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,720
product of p times the this tensor

454
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,240
product

455
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,360
with gamma minus the inner product of s

456
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,200
i and gamma

457
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,919
and now using the the fact one

458
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,039
um

459
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,440
we can take this matrix p

460
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,120
to the other side by

461
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,280
taking the transpose so in the end we

462
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,000
end up with the inner product of

463
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,120
the v1 tensor v2 up to vn

464
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,520
with p transpose gamma

465
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,760
minus the inner product of s i and gamma

466
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,360
so this is this part which comes from

467
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,000
the previous equation

468
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,559
and then in order to use the fact two we

469
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,000
notice that okay this this vector here

470
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,760
can be written as v one tensor and then

471
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,799
the the

472
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,240
large vector which is v2 tensor v3 up to

473
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,600
vm

474
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,080
so we use the fact 2 here

475
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,120
to to write this equation

476
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,799
as

477
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,440
the inner product of v1

478
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,880
with w

479
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,039
which which will we will discuss in a

480
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,360
moment w times

481
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,120
the second vector which is v2 tensor v3

482
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,080
tensor up to vm

483
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,760
okay so what is w

484
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,400
so

485
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,880
the vector w here

486
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,520
corresponds to this vector p transpose

487
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,559
gamma

488
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,400
and then in order to

489
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,520
and then we just apply fact two so w is

490
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,840
it's a matrix

491
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,039
where the rows are w1 w2 up to wl

492
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,520
and then we also need to take care of

493
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,200
this second term which is the inner

494
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,640
product of s i and gamma

495
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,919
okay i just moved the um the equations

496
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,240
to the top so by applying these two

497
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,000
facts the next thing to do is we commit

498
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,840
to the x

499
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,799
which is equal to w times this tensor

500
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,000
product v2 v3 up to vm so it is this is

501
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,480
this term here

502
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,280
and

503
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,080
what we do is we prove the following two

504
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,000
things so first of all we want to prove

505
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,480
that x is well defined so x is equal to

506
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,679
w

507
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,200
times uh v2 tensor v3 up to vn

508
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,960
and then the second thing which is kind

509
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,120
of the thing we want to prove from the

510
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,880
beginning is that we want to prove that

511
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,039
the inner product is zero so as you can

512
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,280
see this term here

513
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,159
is

514
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,720
indeed equal to this inner product that

515
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,480
we want to prove that it is zero

516
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,840
okay so to prove the second part

517
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,919
we we simply can apply the lens

518
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,679
framework because as you can see v1 v1

519
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,000
is committed x is committed si is

520
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,159
committed and these types of equations

521
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,919
are

522
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,000
this is kind of a linear slash

523
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,760
multiplicative relation and it can be

524
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,320
proven using the lens framework

525
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,240
but now the first

526
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,080
the first part

527
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,000
is more interesting

528
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,360
because

529
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,200
yeah it is not a linear relation still

530
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,120
but it is kind of the

531
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,840
this equation it is of the same form as

532
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,240
the one we started with

533
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,320
but the main difference is that

534
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,640
we have we commit to x right we have the

535
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,799
public matrix w

536
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,960
and we have these tensor decompositions

537
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,880
v2 up to vm

538
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,360
but there are on the n minus one vectors

539
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,559
here

540
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,520
which suggest that we can to prove this

541
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,640
relation

542
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,440
we can run run the same reasoning as

543
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,840
before so we have this recursive

544
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
argument

545
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,960
and then we can just run it recursively

546
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,360
and then at some point with m minus one

547
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,880
recursions we will end up with the

548
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,799
situation where we commit to x

549
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,280
and we want to prove that x is equal to

550
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,440
some w some

551
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,720
different w

552
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,039
times just vm

553
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,240
and this

554
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,400
this equation in the end would be a

555
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,720
linear relation and then we can apply

556
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,679
this lanes framework

557
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,080
uh right so um

558
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,720
so one thing to mention is that in each

559
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,280
step we commit to this x right and one

560
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,559
might ask if committing to one more x in

561
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,679
every round or in every recursion step

562
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:04,880
is

563
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,159
costly

564
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,799
so as you can see in this step

565
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,799
yeah even in this first step

566
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,720
that matrix w

567
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,760
has exactly l rows

568
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,000
because each row is w1

569
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,720
while each row the first row is w1 w2 up

570
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,919
to wl so this implies that the mate the

571
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,280
vector x will only have the length l

572
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,440
which will be small

573
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,000
l is this base just to recall

574
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,880
so it doesn't really cost much but yeah

575
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,080
we commit to every x in each

576
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,200
in each step

577
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,480
so there are a few details which are um

578
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,840
kind of hidden

579
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,200
because of the

580
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,520
for the presentation purposes so first

581
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,960
of all if this

582
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,679
equation doesn't hold if p times v 1 up

583
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,640
to v m is not equal to s i then the

584
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,480
inner product that we wanted to prove is

585
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,200
0 and this inner product is 0 with

586
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,440
probability 1 over q

587
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,799
so in our settings we will work with uh

588
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,080
q being around 2 to the 32

589
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,159
which is not very negligible this

590
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,320
probability is not negligible right

591
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,679
so we

592
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,039
we

593
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,400
we work over the extension fields to uh

594
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,480
to boost the soundness and achieve

595
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,280
negligible soundness error

596
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,840
so this is one thing to mention one

597
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
common and the second thing which is

598
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,799
kind of the the main drawback of our uh

599
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,000
construction

600
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,159
is that the verifier runtime is linear

601
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,400
in the size of the set n

602
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,080
and this is clear

603
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,159
just by uh looking at the this intuition

604
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,120
from in the previous slide is and when

605
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,400
we want to compute this matrix w

606
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,640
well in order to compute this matrix w

607
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,880
we have to compute this vector right and

608
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,200
in order in order to com to compute this

609
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,039
vector we have to

610
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,039
cut the verifier will have to calculate

611
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,679
p transpose times gamma

612
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,640
and

613
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,760
and p has uh well p has exactly n

614
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,120
columns

615
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,039
so that's why the verifier runtime will

616
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,720
be linear

617
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,279
and um yeah so

618
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,440
so if even though we have small

619
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,799
signature sizes for like 2 to 21 users

620
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,279
the the runtime might not be that great

621
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,279
okay so thank you very much for watching

622
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,120
this concludes my talk

623
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,799
and here is the link to the full version

624
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,520
of the paper yeah thanks
