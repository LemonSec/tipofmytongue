hello everyone

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,160
i am mahaninho from shanghai john

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,839
university

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,400
today i'm presenting our paper

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,240
push the limit

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,360
of veneen's universal circles simpler

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,440
tight and more compact

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,960
this is a joint work with yuyu soya zhao

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,080
zhanza

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,800
weninyo and the zheng kahu

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,439
the reversal circles can be seen as

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,920
general purpose circles

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,760
for any circle c of size up to n we can

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,160
efficiently encoding say with control

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,120
b's pc satisfied the universal circle

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,480
configured

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,200
under pc is a functional equivalence to

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,520
the original circle c

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,120
for any circle c of size up to earn and

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,079
fly in fact two linear proposed a

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,399
construction of universal circles of

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,360
size

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
19 unknown

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,719
universal circles can be seen as graph

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,160
object

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,199
called

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,559
edge universal graphs eog ensured

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,799
and the size of eog is 4.75

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,000
unlogan

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,360
as well say the size of a uc

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,799
is roughly

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,400
four times

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,680
that of

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,640
the corresponding eog

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,080
before our work the best size efficient

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,360
eog

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,040
has size of 4.5 logan

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,640
and it is known to be the lower bound

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
by three point six four and logan in the

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,640
opening framework

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,320
in this work we give a construction of

42
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,880
edge universal graphs of size 3 and logo

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,680
and we also lower bound the size of our

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,799
ug by

45
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,159
2.95 unlocker

46
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,799
under our framework

47
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,560
notice that

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,079
the size of our eog is even smaller than

49
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,960
the lower bound in linear framework

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,560
which is not contradiction because our

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,840
construction is not under witness

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,200
framework

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,239
a natural application of the universal

54
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,120
circuit is is to preserve functional

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,680
privacy in multiple decamptation

56
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
a multiparty computation can preserve

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,319
input of privacy

58
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,200
for example alice has input x and the

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,120
bubble has input y multiparty

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,599
computation can guarantee that

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,360
any and bubble can get the result cxy

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,160
and nick no further information about

63
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,040
inputs so the protocol guarantees

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,519
the input purposes of the bubble and any

65
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,640
however

66
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,360
in some situations we may want to

67
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,760
preserve functional purposes which can

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,599
be achieved based on universal circles

69
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,360
for example bubble has an input equation

70
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,239
c

71
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,120
then

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,200
bubble can encoding c

73
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,000
into the configuration stream pc

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,120
of the universal circle

75
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,840
the problems reduces to the multiparty

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,200
computation of evaluation

77
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,800
of a public function you see

78
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,599
on

79
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,200
input x and the configuration stream pc

80
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,120
in the end

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,720
the purposes of input x and aggregate c

82
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,200
is preserved

83
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,760
the reversal circle can be seen as h

84
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,080
universal graphs here i want to

85
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,440
introduce h in binding and h universal

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,879
graphs

87
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,000
h inbounding can be seen as injection

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
from graph g to a larger graph g star

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,920
the edge in bounding including two parts

90
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,879
first

91
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,319
it maps from the lower side v to v star

92
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,599
one by one

93
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,959
then

94
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,080
it maps every age in g

95
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,400
to a past in g star

96
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
in a way that is

97
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,200
edge disjoint

98
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,720
meaning that every two paths in g star

99
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,959
have no common age

100
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,040
notice that

101
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,639
there are two types of laws in g-star

102
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,160
the bigger one

103
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,479
called the polar loss

104
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,600
is mapped from a load in

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,880
g

106
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,560
and the smaller one

107
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,600
that have no premises

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,120
in v

109
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,960
such nodes can exact because the load

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,120
the map is only

111
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,120
an injection not a back reaction

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,960
this star is called an eog if and only

113
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,639
if any dhcg of size n and fine file d

114
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,000
can be edge inbounded into g-star

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,400
we typically set firing files of dhd

116
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
to one or two

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,600
greenish framework including three steps

118
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,880
first reducing universal circles to eog2

119
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,240
nominee

120
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,160
edge universal graph

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
for any dag

122
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,840
of firing file 2 second

123
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,240
reducing ug2 to ug1

124
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,360
finally

125
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,199
reducing the problem

126
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,680
of construction of eog-1

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,199
to itself

128
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,000
but with a much smaller size

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,560
the this reduction is recursive

130
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,840
and here the analyte eog one is smaller

131
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,400
enough and it can be constructed by hand

132
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,800
here we introduce the first step

133
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,600
reducing uc to ug2

134
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,319
the left figure is a circle with two

135
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,240
inputs x y and the two gigs

136
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
x or n

137
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,880
and the two outputs the circle can be

138
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,360
seen as a dag

139
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,319
the right figure is a universal circle

140
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,440
which can be seen as a dag

141
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,160
an eog

142
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,280
we showed at the edge inbounding from

143
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,880
the dlg in the left figure to the eog in

144
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,639
the right figure

145
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,720
in the left figure the left side

146
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,039
including x y x or n

147
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,880
in correspondings

148
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,560
in the right figure we can also see x y

149
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,400
and xo

150
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,240
which are called polar loads

151
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,080
the eog including other smaller nodes

152
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,159
called control loads first

153
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,280
the control load with one input and the

154
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,880
two outputs

155
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,800
is called split

156
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,759
which copies the view of the input to

157
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,720
the two outputs

158
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,240
second

159
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,520
so one with two inputs and two outputs

160
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,000
we call it x-switch

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,840
which can configure into two cases

162
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,720
switch or r loss switch

163
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,919
finally

164
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,680
the control load with two inputs and two

165
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,599
and one output

166
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,520
we call it y switch which also workings

167
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,440
in two cases

168
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,560
copy the view of the left input to the

169
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,479
output or copying the view of the right

170
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,080
input to the output

171
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,759
a x switch

172
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,560
can be implemented by four basically

173
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,080
gets

174
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,680
a y switch can be implemented by three

175
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,520
bicycle gates

176
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,720
and uh uh you'll universal get can be

177
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,960
implemented by three ui switch

178
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,319
for example

179
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,319
x switch needs one control b c if c is

180
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,319
set to zero then it becomes a long

181
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,599
switch left in left out

182
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,759
as well it works in the switch models

183
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,120
left in right out

184
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,599
here we introduce the second step

185
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,720
reducing ug2 to ug1

186
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,319
every instance

187
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,919
of dag2 can be divided into two

188
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,679
instances of dh1 which can be

189
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,360
edge inbounded by two instances of the

190
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,760
corresponding eog-1

191
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,399
we merge the two

192
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,480
eog-1 into a single eog-2

193
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,399
for each dag-1 where h-inbounding it

194
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,440
into

195
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,200
a instance of

196
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,000
eog-1

197
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,600
finally we compile to instance of eog1

198
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,279
into one instance

199
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,240
of eog2 by eliminating

200
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
the overlapping

201
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,920
polar loss therefore the size of eog2 is

202
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,279
2 times of the size of ug1

203
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,399
and minus the number of overlapping

204
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,320
polar loads

205
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,800
which is n

206
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,080
the final step reducing ug

207
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,600
of grid size n to eog

208
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,600
of smaller size typically divided by a

209
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,760
factor key

210
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,640
we can repeat this step

211
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,839
many times and here the size is smaller

212
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,880
enough

213
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,360
before introducing this reduction we

214
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,120
showed two important notions used in

215
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,560
this deduction

216
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,160
augmented dig and super low first the

217
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,120
augmented diag can be seen as a super

218
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,959
dig force for example dhg has k nose p1

219
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,160
to pk

220
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,360
and the sound edges

221
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,640
the augmented dig

222
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,399
and k input nodes and the k output nodes

223
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,000
then the augmented dig can end some

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
edges

225
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,360
either from

226
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,440
an important role to a load in the

227
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,640
middle

228
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,200
or from a law in the middle to the

229
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,440
output node

230
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,720
as long as the resulting augmented dig

231
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
instead of the grid one

232
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,680
now with the augmented dig we can define

233
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,800
the notion of k-way super law

234
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,560
a k-way super low

235
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,120
or snk in shoot is a special eog

236
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,200
second edge inbound

237
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,000
any augmented dhk for example the above

238
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
figure is a

239
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,720
an augmented dhg with four polar laws

240
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,079
four input nodes 4 output nodes

241
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,279
and below is a corresponding

242
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,760
4-way super low

243
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,320
as defined previously

244
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,200
edge embankment mapping including

245
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,839
loading node mapping and

246
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,079
edge mapping to a path

247
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,600
for example agent b mapping to a path

248
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,240
from agent b5

249
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,800
to agent b9

250
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,440
now we reveal venin's recursive

251
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,640
reduction

252
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,800
from eog

253
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,639
of size n to ug of size n or k

254
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,800
which is achieved

255
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,440
based on the building block kv super low

256
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,320
first

257
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,519
we put

258
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,320
an 0k super lows in source

259
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,480
then we merge the output nodes of each

260
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,200
supernode with the input nodes of the

261
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,120
next immediate

262
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,200
supernode component welds

263
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,079
these the marginal nodes

264
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,440
can be divided into k sides

265
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,839
for each side

266
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,800
for each side

267
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,040
we use a smaller eug1 to combat this

268
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,959
combination nodes

269
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,880
and the polars of the smaller ug1 one by

270
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,160
one

271
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,120
the resulting marginal nodes

272
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,120
have two inputs and two outputs

273
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,839
which can be

274
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,839
implemented by xh node

275
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,560
it can be proved that

276
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,920
any dag of size n can be edged

277
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,040
inbounding into this graph

278
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,760
this graph

279
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,360
and therefore

280
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,560
it gives a construction of eog

281
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,920
veneent proposed two kinds

282
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,000
of super lows two-way supernova of size

283
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,320
five

284
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
and four-way supernodes

285
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,800
of size 19.

286
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
notice that the input and its output

287
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,240
nodes

288
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,200
are not counted into the size of

289
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,320
supernova

290
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,920
the result into the corresponding ug

291
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,600
of size 5

292
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,440
and logan

293
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,160
and

294
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,839
4.75 and logan respectively

295
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,040
our construction does not follow linear

296
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,240
framework

297
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,600
the left hand is a linear framework

298
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,079
and the right hand is our intermediate

299
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,079
conjunction

300
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,839
the difference between the two

301
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,000
conjunction is that

302
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,560
in linear framework we combine the

303
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,000
output node of the above supernode and

304
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,079
the impedance of the next beknow

305
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,600
supernode into a single node

306
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,639
which will then match it

307
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,279
matched with the polar of the smaller

308
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,560
eog

309
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,760
well

310
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,480
in our intermediate construction we

311
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,120
combined the important null and output

312
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,079
null of the same supernode

313
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,839
into a single node

314
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,519
and merged it with a polar of the

315
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,480
smaller eog

316
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,120
it is easy to say that

317
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,680
bostovanian framework and our

318
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,240
intermediate's construction are about

319
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,839
the same size

320
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,440
and both achieve edge inbounded

321
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,560
but

322
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,600
we don't seem to accomplish

323
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,199
any improvement

324
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,639
with the

325
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,800
with this intermediate construction

326
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,279
we have two observation

327
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,399
about our intermediate's construction

328
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,279
first

329
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,399
node a is an x switch

330
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,040
which have two options

331
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,079
but

332
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,399
it is unnecessary

333
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,199
that a passed and the smaller eog salute

334
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,440
edge number four

335
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,120
then leave it intermediately

336
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,720
in other words

337
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,240
if a pass has age number four

338
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,199
then

339
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,199
its next age must be age number three

340
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,560
not age number two

341
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,320
second

342
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,560
if a pass

343
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,199
process slowed the load a from inside

344
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,560
the

345
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,040
smaller eog

346
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,480
then

347
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,680
it will

348
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,040
end the corresponding super low

349
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,480
in other words

350
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,680
h1

351
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,759
will be followed by

352
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,519
h number two

353
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,959
not age number three on the past four is

354
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,639
inbounded

355
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,759
therefore

356
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,040
the option

357
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,839
for xh node is always fixed

358
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,040
our end construction

359
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,839
take

360
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,720
this redundance

361
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,680
into the account

362
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,480
and remove the x-switch node

363
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
to load a minus

364
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,360
in the previous node of the node a in

365
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,279
the smaller ug

366
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,920
then we delete

367
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,000
h number one and h number two

368
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,279
and and

369
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,160
the h from

370
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,720
node a matters to the corresponding

371
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,040
super low

372
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,560
node a plus

373
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,000
is the next node

374
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,520
of the load

375
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,240
a

376
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,880
in the smaller eog then we need

377
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,559
edge number three and h number four

378
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,000
and and

379
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,319
the edge from the corresponding super

380
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,000
low to

381
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,199
load a plus

382
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,039
this leads to

383
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,280
a more compacter construction of eog

384
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,360
without affecting

385
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,400
the function

386
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,720
of the universal edge in bounding

387
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,000
based on our introduction the size of

388
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,400
eog2 is two times of the size of ug1

389
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
minus n

390
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,160
in our construction

391
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,039
the size of eog 1 is k times of the size

392
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,520
of the smaller ug1

393
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,960
plus n over k

394
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,760
times of the size of

395
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,440
k-way super low minus earned combination

396
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,559
notes

397
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,679
the advantage of our construction

398
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,320
overviews framework

399
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,760
is minus earth

400
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,080
highlighted

401
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,679
in rate

402
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,760
this leads to the size of eog 2 of our

403
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,240
construction

404
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,520
moreover

405
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,480
we prove that a low bound

406
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,679
of 2.95

407
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,960
earn login for our construction

408
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,039
when instantiated with a two-way super

409
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,520
low of size 5

410
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,360
we can get a construction of eog 2

411
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,400
of size 3 unlock a

412
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,960
the size of our construction

413
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,000
suite and log in is very close to the

414
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,520
lower bound

415
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,480
2.95

416
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,799
logan

417
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,320
finally we visualize the comparison with

418
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
the previous works

419
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,360
our construction improves

420
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,400
upon the faster previous work

421
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,640
by about

422
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,480
33 percent

423
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,840
there are some donated works

424
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,559
about universal circles

425
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,520
thanks for listening
