00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,319
hello to everyone my name is lorenzo

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,399
spignoli i'm going to present you

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,160
secular world shuffling in the probing

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,200
model

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,280
a joint work with the professor john

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,360
sebastian coron at the university of

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,440
luxembourg

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,199
so we are in the side channel area

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,920
where essentially the implementation are

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,199
not always a true black boxer in fact

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,199
some adversary may

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,840
gain some information or recover

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,320
some sensitive data by monitoring the

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,440
physical properties of the device

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,760
the very first approach for that

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,440
was discovering fix that is whenever a

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,680
new attack

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,879
was discovered then a specific contra

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,440
measure for that specific attack would

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,079
have been found and implemented

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,520
this until in 2003 ishai shai wegner

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,800
came out with a new model formalizing

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,600
and

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,879
grouping

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,080
all such side channel attacks

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,640
in their model they provided

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,200
security notions

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,720
now considering an adversary which can

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,040
probe

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,880
abundant number of

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,840
wires

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,600
in the circuit

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,159
they provided some security notions in

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,040
term of a transformer taking a circuit c

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
and resulting in a new different one c

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,439
prime

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,759
which has to respect two properties

38
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,000
soundness and privacy

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
soundness

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
guarantees that c and c prime will have

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,280
the same input output functionalities

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,119
while the privacy

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,720
states that the view of every adversary

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,880
probing at most t

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,240
in three wires in the circuit

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,920
can be simulated from scratch

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,079
in their paper they proposed

48
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,240
a construction for

49
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,959
both perfect privacy and statistical one

50
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,239
they achieved the the first case the

51
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,959
perfect security against the t probes

52
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,440
through the now well-known masking

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,040
control measures

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,720
which is

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,160
along the circuit now

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,440
uh the gates are not dealing directly

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,200
with the uh sensitivity data a

58
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,319
rather than with the n out of n secret

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,760
sharing

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,879
so whenever a gate

61
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,599
process computes some operation

62
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,599
such gate will deal

63
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,200
with the shares

64
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,519
independently

65
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,319
in the box you can see an example of it

66
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,200
i choose the multiplication

67
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,959
in fact the output is a set of van

68
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,360
shares ci's

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,879
and such ci's are computed considering

70
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,080
some part in part of some

71
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,920
input sharing

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,720
part with some other variables

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,800
but with the probability that with the

74
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,159
property that

75
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,080
soaring

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,400
all the output shares

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,239
the result will be equal to the

78
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,599
multiplication of the original signals a

79
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,440
and b

80
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,879
they achieved

81
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,200
perfect security against the probes with

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,519
a number of shares equal to 2t plus 1.

83
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,760
the only disadvantage of it it's the

84
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,440
cost which is quadratic in the number of

85
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,640
shares and in turn in the number of

86
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,920
probes

87
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,360
in fact

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,640
in order to improve such complexity

89
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,239
they relaxed a bit the notion

90
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,080
of privacy notion

91
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,840
allowing now

92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,400
to the adversary to recover

93
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,360
the information the secret some secret

94
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,159
leakage with some non-zero and very

95
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,840
small or negligible probability

96
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,200
as we will see

97
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
the transformer the transformer will

98
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,720
work in two steps

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,639
but at the second of it

100
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,918
the the end of the second the they will

101
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,120
still achieve worst case security

102
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,080
will

103
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,960
with

104
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,240
quasi-linear complexity

105
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,880
but still such construction is

106
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,400
considered

107
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,919
unpractical

108
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,560
in fact our course contribution will be

109
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
a proposed

110
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,360
variant

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,080
of while shuffling contra-measure from

112
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,880
eswe which will achieve linear

113
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,280
complexity in the ram model

114
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,400
we also provided an implementation of it

115
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,639
and as you can see from the

116
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,759
figure

117
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,120
our shuffling control measures on long

118
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,479
range

119
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,880
will work much better than the classical

120
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,240
masking

121
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,120
with a crossing point around

122
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,000
6

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,440
thousands

124
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,240
probes

125
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,360
so

126
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,320
let's present their construction for the

127
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,919
statistical

128
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,280
privacy

129
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,919
as i mentioned the transformer

130
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,440
will works

131
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,240
will work in two steps the first one

132
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,840
will consider

133
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,320
a new security definition

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
the average case

135
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,759
model

136
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,440
or formally the random probing secure

137
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,520
where now the adversary

138
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,039
cannot choose

139
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,720
which wires

140
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,560
he wants to probe

141
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,280
rather than each wire of the circuit

142
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,520
will leak independently with some

143
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,400
probability p

144
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,600
they

145
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,080
showed that applying the classical

146
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,880
masking against now not e but k probes

147
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,240
where k is the security parameter and

148
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,680
choosing a p equal to an omega of 1 over

149
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,720
k

150
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,600
then

151
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,560
such

152
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,160
circuit c prime is indeed p random

153
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,520
secure

154
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,400
and the proof for that relies on the

155
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,639
reliant on the chain of bound

156
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,960
the second in the second step

157
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,120
the transformer will

158
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,720
expand the intermediate circle circuit c

159
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,240
prime into a larger one

160
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,240
in and in sort of sense uh sparser

161
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,560
uh so in this way

162
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,880
only a small uh part of the total wires

163
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,199
in the circuit we will actually take

164
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,840
care of the

165
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,479
computation

166
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,759
in particular

167
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,520
each wire i

168
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,840
in the circuit c prime

169
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,360
and carrying

170
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,080
signal of y

171
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,160
will be replaced in c prime prime

172
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
with a set of new l wires

173
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,280
where

174
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,840
all of them will take care of some dummy

175
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,919
values let's say

176
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,360
dollar sign

177
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,599
but for one

178
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,639
which actually uh will be the useful

179
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,720
part of the computation

180
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,280
and it will take care of the signal why

181
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,720
which wire

182
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,199
will take care of the signal

183
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,240
it's chosen at random uniformly at

184
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,720
random

185
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,759
so in this way

186
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,560
we t probes the probability of the

187
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
adversary

188
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,039
of recovering the signal the original

189
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,120
signal is of course

190
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
p

191
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,520
equal

192
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,240
t

193
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,680
over l

194
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,280
and the proof uh of the security uh

195
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,000
is based on the fact that if c prime is

196
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,360
secure in the p random probing model

197
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,560
then c prime prime will be secure

198
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,680
against the probes

199
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,440
going a bit deeper

200
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,560
in the final circuit c prime essentially

201
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,479
each one input gate it's it's pretty

202
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,160
straightforward

203
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,280
instead

204
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,960
the operation which require

205
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,879
two inputs

206
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,840
need a little bit of more attention in

207
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,519
fact to compute

208
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,360
the operation between vi and vj one must

209
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,958
put the signal

210
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,200
the signals in the same consecutive

211
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,279
position

212
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,800
and in the eos eswe

213
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,000
they used a certain network

214
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
to achieve such property

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,640
which has a cost of elogel

216
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,920
and from such a from such cost

217
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,040
depends the overall complexity of big o

218
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,320
t log t

219
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,040
for

220
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,519
security in the worst

221
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,720
case

222
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,480
model against t primes three probes

223
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,959
and exactly in this part of their

224
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,760
construction that we propose a variant

225
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,040
and essentially we will modify

226
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,720
how to achieve

227
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,959
this adagency property

228
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,399
and we will improve the overall cost

229
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,839
of a logarithmic

230
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,240
factor how how we did that is

231
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,880
essentially uh the main difference with

232
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,480
the eswb construction is now

233
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,080
explicitly compute the deposition gi of

234
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,880
which signal y

235
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,320
in fact

236
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,360
thanks to that we can

237
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,720
generate that random a new

238
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,040
index j prime prime

239
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,760
we we have called the shuffling index

240
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,480
and we can

241
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,720
cyclically shift both the inputs

242
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,360
in this way

243
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
shift shifting

244
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,279
the the inputs

245
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,959
with the delta of j prime prime minus j

246
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:21,760
i

247
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,240
in this case automatically

248
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,120
we will have in the same consecutive

249
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,240
position both the signal y and j

250
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,519
of course we have we had to slightly uh

251
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,920
change the uh proof

252
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,720
since now the adversary can probe

253
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,079
directly

254
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,079
the signal position

255
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,480
the trick here uh

256
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,800
of our uh proof

257
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,680
uh

258
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,000
relies on the non-addictivity uh

259
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,519
probes of the stateless

260
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,120
model

261
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,240
in which the adversary must commit

262
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,000
uh must declare in advance

263
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,920
which are the t probes

264
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,440
he want to

265
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,720
read

266
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,160
and learn

267
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,240
so now the adversary yes can learn such

268
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,360
index

269
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,839
but when you learn it it's too late it

270
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,519
cannot change

271
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,320
the the choosing the corrupted wires no

272
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,360
more

273
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,800
so the probability of learning

274
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,920
the signal will still stay

275
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,519
t over l

276
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,440
as in the esw reconstruction

277
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,600
and that's that's a

278
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,519
figure representing the the new gates

279
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,480
and

280
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,399
summarizing essentially my my

281
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,200
explanation

282
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,760
so

283
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,440
as i told you uh before we

284
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,800
have a running time of big o of l in the

285
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,560
random model

286
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,680
instead of big o of a log l

287
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,000
as introduced and presented in esw

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,160
you can see

289
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,780
from the table

290
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,440
[Music]

291
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,680
the comparison between the time

292
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,160
complexity and the circuit complexity

293
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,040
and also our control measure

294
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,560
has the smaller advantage of being

295
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,560
much easier to implement in practice

296
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,760
so now

297
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,639
as a last contribution

298
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,399
we also provided a construction for the

299
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,880
stateful model

300
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,279
a stateful circuit is essentially a

301
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,720
circuit with a memory cell

302
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,839
in such a memory cell can be seen as a

303
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,120
gate

304
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,720
which will output

305
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,120
the previous input

306
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,399
and

307
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,600
store

308
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,560
the correct input for the next execution

309
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,800
for example you can see

310
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
you can

311
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,720
see a stateful model as a external

312
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,959
input and output wires for example in a

313
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,399
block cipher like ies

314
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,720
such state will be

315
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,360
representing the key

316
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,240
of the protocol

317
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,600
so now

318
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,240
we are dealing with more execution and

319
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,200
so that bursary can move its probes

320
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,240
between

321
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,600
the executions and also we can

322
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,040
judge the movement of such probes

323
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,560
according to what he see what what he

324
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,600
have seen

325
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,199
uh from the

326
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,480
output of the previous one

327
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,000
so it requires some more

328
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
counter measures

329
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,320
in

330
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,040
esw

331
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,360
each memory cell is

332
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,560
simply

333
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,600
perfectly private transformed

334
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,480
okay

335
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,079
uh so with the classical perfect secure

336
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,880
uh control measure uh with number of

337
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,680
share

338
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,320
2t plus one uh that makes the overall

339
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,600
cost of the

340
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,720
circuit

341
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,440
uh

342
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,079
two three to the three log t

343
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,040
times the number of the memory cell s

344
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,439
represents the number of the memory cell

345
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,440
our contribution for the stateful model

346
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,920
uh will take into consideration a

347
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,240
randomizing network

348
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,079
um

349
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,680
it's one of the cases where the picture

350
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,040
it's a better explanation of any words

351
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,440
but i will still try my best essentially

352
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,639
it's a network composed by

353
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,639
log2 of l

354
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,480
layers

355
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,120
and in each layers they

356
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,920
let's call it each hand layer the

357
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,800
information in the eighth

358
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,079
and e plus twenty wires

359
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,160
are zwift with independent probability 1

360
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,160
over 2 with alpha probability

361
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,920
that's not enough we we needed to

362
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
implicitly

363
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,600
compute the index position for our proof

364
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,240
uh since if you remember uh in the

365
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,880
stateless model each gate will proce

366
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,720
will generate and process explicitly

367
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,839
the index position of the set of l wires

368
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,680
to avoid that

369
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,480
we simply added a secret shift

370
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,600
which will not change the overlord cost

371
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,199
and

372
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,800
make such

373
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,120
index position implicitly

374
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,040
and essentially

375
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,920
that's how we dealt uh we deal with

376
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,600
every cell

377
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
and we can save

378
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,560
a

379
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,920
quadratic

380
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,440
cost in fact our complexity

381
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,079
will be quasi-linear

382
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,040
times of course the the number

383
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,600
of memory cells

384
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,720
and

385
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,480
the proof

386
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,160
which that that's um

387
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,040
statistical statistically private

388
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,440
essentially uh it's based on the fact

389
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,160
that the swap is performed for

390
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,040
all the layers and in this way at the

391
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,120
end of the last layer

392
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,279
the output index

393
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,160
is randomly distributed

394
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,360
so the adversary cannot take advantage

395
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,399
of

396
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,040
any computation

397
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,639
and i think we are in the conclusion

398
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,839
part so essentially to summarize we

399
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,880
propose to you a first improvement

400
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,480
for the wire shuffling control measure

401
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,039
an improvement which is

402
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,240
somehow

403
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,760
practical even if with a crossing or a

404
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,039
crossover point at around

405
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,720
six

406
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,720
thousand

407
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,079
i will conclude with sort of uh

408
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,160
thoughts for mind

409
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,559
such implementation is still completely

410
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,480
unpractical for embedded uh system uh

411
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,080
for example like a smart card

412
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,440
and the open

413
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,039
question is

414
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,720
can we still

415
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,679
save and make it practical even for that

416
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,280
devices

417
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,400
reducing the random uh in the circuit

418
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,280
so using cellular random generation and

419
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,960
the cop set of l locality

420
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,280
and with that i think

421
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,720
yes that's all

422
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,360
thank you very much and see you online

423
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,399
at the conference
