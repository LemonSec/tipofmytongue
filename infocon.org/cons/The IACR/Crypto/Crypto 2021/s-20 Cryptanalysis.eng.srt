00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,800
okay

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,000
um

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,359
then yeah so

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,280
okay you're ready to start

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,200
okay so

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,240
welcome to the thursday

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,320
session of the first session of thursday

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,600
for crypto

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,439
which is going to be about cryptanalysis

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,760
so they're going to have four talks

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,680
um first

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,439
about symmetrical analysis and then

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,960
there will be a small break and then

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
three more talks

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,640
about more more general types of

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,399
cryptanalysis

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,680
um

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,680
just as a reminder everybody is welcome

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,440
to ask questions

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,399
in the

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,640
chat that you can access from the the

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,399
very nice

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,719
website

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,760
and

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,600
all the questions will be related to the

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,320
speakers at the end of the the

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,079
presentation so at the end of the first

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,879
four presentations that is and uh let's

29
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,359
just start right away see by the way if

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,840
you have trouble asking in chat

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,040
in the

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,680
zulu chat you can you may also ask in

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,840
the in the zoom chat i

34
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,119
guess you have the other link actually

35
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,840
in the zoom chat so anyway let's start

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,600
right away so the first talk is going to

37
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,680
be uh about the differential linear

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,960
capacities from that periodic

39
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,320
perspective by

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,798
uh matching you how to do

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,640
you will give the talk

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,320
uh

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,079
yeah

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,720
they change you how you uh do you hear

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,880
me

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,840
we can't hear you if you're speaking

47
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,040
we can't hear you

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,640
yeah

49
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,319
i it's weird because i see his

50
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,440
microphone uh moving in the zoom but i

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,840
can't hear anything

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,040
i guess if uh

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,560
if there is a problem we could start

54
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,800
with a second talk

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,519
uh if that's okay until the this problem

56
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,000
is resolved i would recommend may ching

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,599
liu you disconnect from zoom and

58
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,720
reconnect

59
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,280
try again

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,440
and then go on to the next talk

61
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,519
you mean meanwhile go to the next talk

62
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,239
yes okay until they figure it out so is

63
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,239
that okay um i guess the next talk um

64
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,440
would be uh

65
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,519
given by uh sarvyang hua

66
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,519
so is that okay oh okay can you hear me

67
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,040
yeah would you be okay with starting

68
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,879
okay

69
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,480
uh

70
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,040
oh i cannot share my

71
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,599
pdf

72
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,200
you don't have permission

73
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,518
okay

74
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,000
well you might need to give permission

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,238
and then

76
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,120
restart

77
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,520
so may change have you reconnected

78
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,440
okay because otherwise we might just

79
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,479
move to the third talk

80
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,919
so we have a kind of a tight schedule so

81
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,759
we need to move ahead

82
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,080
now the photo could be given by your

83
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,560
pension

84
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,198
okay

85
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,080
can you hear me

86
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,520
yeah yes

87
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,280
can you see my screen yes okay i think i

88
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,680
can just need to make it full screen

89
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,840
okay

90
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,680
so we're starting with sorry we're

91
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,320
starting with a third look then

92
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
which is going to be given by the yao

93
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,039
pinching

94
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,120
and it will it is a

95
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
in a collaboration with lei wang

96
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,160
tao tawuku and kim wing

97
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,680
and it is about representing the

98
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,639
security of dbhts max beyond birthday

99
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,800
bound in a multi-user setting

100
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,080
and uh yeah

101
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,560
it's up to you your opinion

102
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,960
okay thank you for introduction

103
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,199
uh i'm your bm today i'll talk to you

104
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,919
the visiting security of dbhd marks

105
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,520
beyond busted bound in the mud user

106
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,440
setting and this is the durian world

107
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,600
with day one

108
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,479
and the tin wong

109
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,240
dbhm are cluster marks that aim for

110
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,560
achieving the beyond sound security

111
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,520
including some ecbc pima plus

112
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,160
ckf9 and the latimer plus

113
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,080
and interestingly all these marks

114
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,240
throwing a similar paradigm called

115
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,160
double broadcasting some

116
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,720
this paradigm is firstly abstract hour

117
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,280
by daytime or in fsd since

118
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,440
2019

119
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,960
in its product

120
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,680
uh a major will first map to a 2mb

121
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,479
string by a double block hash function

122
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,800
and then a true inquisitive value of

123
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,440
each half will be extra sum

124
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,880
uh to produce different tasks

125
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,120
uh let's recall the recent result

126
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
regarding the dht mark

127
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,840
uh this how the how the proof that this

128
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,919
generic uh framework can achieve that

129
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,160
beyond basic bond a security with the

130
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,960
boundless uh q to the power 3 over 202 n

131
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,440
and then lorenzo gets positive attack on

132
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,960
this mark with a capacity base 2 to the

133
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,919
power

134
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,919
3 and 4.

135
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,039
and very recently kinetico uh

136
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,599
give a tight security bond

137
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,800
uh for the dbh smart there is a q2a

138
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,880
power for thurs open tutorial powers and

139
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,280
at this stage it seems the story of dbh

140
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,800
smiley is reasonably complete

141
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,080
but however above beyond response result

142
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,880
only considered single users

143
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
in practice

144
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,960
the adobe's adversary can typically

145
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,280
attack multiple users at the same time

146
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,759
and are directly distributing its

147
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,960
resources

148
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,599
this is particularly true for the mark

149
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,440
as a one of the most commonly used

150
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,960
cryptocurrency primitive in practice

151
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,199
marks are usually depreciated in context

152
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,840
with a great number of users

153
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,039
for example my marks are called

154
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,280
element of real-world security protocols

155
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,960
such as ssl ssh-86

156
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,080
and has been a very active users a major

157
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,120
website

158
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,599
so one only one natural question is that

159
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,919
how number of users will affect the

160
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,000
security balance of landmark or more

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,280
specifically

162
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,520
can the dbh mark steelshield beyond

163
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,520
responsibility in the module's setting

164
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,160
if we use the step-up duration reduction

165
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,319
from a single search treaty to remark

166
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,280
user security for mass

167
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
base i will just multiply by the single

168
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,440
user bound by the number of users then

169
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,919
we will obtain the matrices result of

170
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,720
the bhma that's something like u

171
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,639
q to the power u q to the power 3 over 2

172
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,240
to n of uq power 4 3 over 2 to the power

173
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,440
n

174
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
here you is the number use the series

175
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,880
number of requires

176
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,519
and if the adversary only if you want

177
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,440
query per users then the bank will be

178
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,880
something last year

179
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,959
which is the other birthday bond or even

180
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,519
worse universal bond

181
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,360
so the dialogue analysis or mean

182
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,839
security of dbh money is much desired

183
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,399
instead of not relying on

184
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,279
lose generic reduction

185
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,000
so our contributions are manifold we

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,640
directly analyze the dbh mark in the mud

187
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,480
user setting and we propose a generative

188
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,839
but user proof framework for dbh max our

189
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,160
framework has two probabilities the

190
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,720
first one is that it is easy to use one

191
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,200
only need to prove the hash price is on

192
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,240
one regular and if two almost universal

193
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
the second one you say you can achieve a

194
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
high scripted bond based beyond bank

195
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,080
security

196
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,000
we also demonstrate our framework with

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,360
application to reduce radio dbh max

198
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,040
and prove less

199
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,920
2k some ecbc 2kpm plus 2k11 plus my plus

200
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,680
our secure in the

201
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,279
uh our secure beyondbuster bank in the

202
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,680
multiple session and for

203
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,720
2k f9 the remaining one of a key reduced

204
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,920
variance of dbs mass we cannot prove it

205
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,080
is security instead

206
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,640
we find a critical flaw on it

207
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,880
uh note that this this construction is

208
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,560
proved to achieve the belong based bank

209
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,160
in previous work

210
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,480
and we find that one query is not to

211
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,640
play breaking security

212
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,200
we also show a birthday attack on

213
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,000
several variants of 2kf9 and start

214
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,360
evaded that

215
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,440
layer beyonce bang result

216
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,519
here is our conclusion

217
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,600
we propose in our favor we propose that

218
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,760
beyond response qr might use the proof

219
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,399
framework for dbhd mark

220
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,680
and prove that the 2k some ecbc 2kpmr

221
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,279
plus 2k laptop light mypass as

222
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,519
bian-based rebound secure in the smart

223
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,040
user city and for 2k s9 which show is

224
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,600
insecure and also proposed

225
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,160
a first bound attack on stable variant

226
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,480
of 2.9

227
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,600
we also can construct some interesting

228
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,160
problems for future work the first one

229
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,000
is that uh whether can we fix that who

230
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,440
cares nice to go beyond the first

231
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
rebound again

232
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,279
uh this problem seems non-trivial since

233
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,079
a simple trick does not work as it is

234
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,920
trading or paper the second one is that

235
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,240
wheeler can can improve the color must

236
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,600
use the secret bank of dbh mark to the

237
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,399
3rd over 4bs security just as in the

238
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,959
case of in the simple user setting

239
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,560
okay let's let's all thank you

240
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,839
thank you

241
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,640
so uh meeting you are you

242
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,200
able to

243
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,279
[Music]

244
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,079
present your hand okay you can hear him

245
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,640
yeah we can explain my screen now

246
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,880
okay

247
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,000
okay so the next talk will be what was

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,360
originally planned to be the first stock

249
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,480
of the session if you're looking at the

250
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,720
program so it is about differential

251
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,200
linear cryptanalysis from an algebraic

252
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,560
perspective

253
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,839
and it is a

254
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,040
co-authored by uh mei chengdu zheow and

255
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,399
pong tai lin

256
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,959
and i mentioned you will give the talk

257
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,519
okay thank you for the introduction uh

258
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,279
it's it is something something wrong

259
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,000
with

260
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,480
my network so i

261
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,760
didn't

262
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,079
share my face so it just used the

263
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,240
microphone

264
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,000
uh this general is the wizard

265
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,639
uh different linear chromosomes and the

266
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,560
linear chromosomes are two

267
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,959
most important uh articles in

268
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,240
symmetrical uh criminality and uh

269
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,279
in 1994 uh landfall and herman

270
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,600
proposed the differential linear and

271
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,800
carbonacy either an engineers

272
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,480
combination of a differential linear

273
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,360
purpose

274
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,240
however there are few methods for

275
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,800
examination the best of the l probation

276
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,839
in the middle uh a natural method is the

277
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,839
experiment method and the

278
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,320
typical method is there are manual

279
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,720
expectations and the

280
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,079
launch method processor purpose at

281
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,760
eurocraft 2019

282
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,720
[Music]

283
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,800
is a dlcp

284
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,160
it is more accurately than before

285
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,560
for many surfers including

286
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,519
the ds separate and escrow

287
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,399
although there are still gaps

288
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,399
in this struggle we are studying a

289
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,600
little

290
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,839
lineup for a message from a different uh

291
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,959
hbr

292
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,399
uh

293
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,040
purpose perspective uh this is back the

294
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,000
fact that the best they turned by the uh

295
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,600
a nf that is a h brian number form

296
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,120
but it is

297
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,320
invisible to

298
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,120
compute enough of a software or to

299
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,320
simplify

300
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,800
the computation uh to make it feasible

301
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,040
when you simplify the enough to

302
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,680
atf that is the edge by trans

303
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,440
transitional form

304
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,399
uh

305
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,480
for the indifferent the difference of

306
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,160
the output server we use the

307
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,440
differential uh edge transform transient

308
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,560
form with the help of the daf we we can

309
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,720
extend ultimate dl best and then we can

310
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,800
try to find the good exploration by uh

311
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,560
as a resulting research

312
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,040
and then um

313
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,079
you know my our final goal is to

314
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,480
kill cover or to this end we improve

315
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,920
some uh

316
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,760
conditional on the internal beat also

317
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,120
have to make a certain difference

318
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,959
determining the first ones

319
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,800
and then search through good uh

320
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,079
explanations

321
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,199
this process either organically

322
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,680
a combination of the distinguished

323
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,160
research and the key guessing at this

324
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,000
media idea of our

325
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,360
technique

326
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,040
so what are the

327
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
atf and the dhf we introduced the

328
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,560
assemblies

329
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,160
uh transitional rule uh for atf

330
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,120
uh

331
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,519
as showing this uh slides

332
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,560
uh for the

333
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
function omega

334
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,000
without the ruling uh the the binary

335
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,199
variable x

336
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,560
uh if it involves two or more variables

337
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,560
then we defined the idf of omega uh as a

338
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,360
new variable uh otherwise

339
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,680
we keep it unchanged

340
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,920
this ruler ensures that the itfr effects

341
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,880
needed to actually either adf of inverse

342
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,320
infrared that can activate unchanged

343
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,199
to compute the atf we

344
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,839
can see the condition

345
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,759
is showing this feature

346
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,680
uh the big x is a vector of variable

347
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,639
and the smart is a parallel variable the

348
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,199
data is the input difference

349
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,000
for the first run we compute the nf

350
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,959
and then we are applying the hdf to the

351
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,440
results and then i can build the atf for

352
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,279
the saffron and then

353
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,079
we repeat this steps again again until

354
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,839
observe the adhd then this is uh

355
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,519
adhdf i use the ddf we can con computer

356
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,800
the best

357
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,959
uh we apply the

358
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,480
technology to

359
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,639
three different number uh different

360
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,880
types of

361
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,240
servers

362
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,839
including

363
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,279
also kkk including block cipher sim

364
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,399
server and

365
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,839
the method the result for the estimation

366
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,399
the best as showing the table

367
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,639
compared with the dfct our

368
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,720
dhf is more

369
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,320
accurate and can apply with more ones

370
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,759
and

371
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,240
our technique can also apply to

372
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,759
defensive linear differential uh

373
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,040
attacks

374
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,000
uh

375
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,839
compared with a digestion method i would

376
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,320
take it is more

377
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,120
powerful and more generally and

378
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,680
read out for the kelly tower attack i'll

379
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,480
show you in this table uh especially our

380
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,759
our tech uh we prepared the first

381
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,040
uh crashed

382
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,120
attack on the first launch uh on inspect

383
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,480
and

384
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,000
and the first

385
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,199
division linear attack on the 11th one

386
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,480
uh stacks 112 128

387
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,359
uh

388
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,280
to summary we have

389
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,640
assured the

390
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,599
uh edge project prospector on the

391
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,599
uh different linux class with a

392
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,280
application to the

393
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,679
uh cesar and the fire and the air damage

394
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,919
finance esco and the es finance the

395
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,840
serpent and the eastern finance the

396
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,720
greenway one uh we believe that the tour

397
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
is useful uh

398
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,280
would be useful

399
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,720
in both

400
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,240
criminals and the designer of the

401
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,720
symmetrical crime system uh thank you

402
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,919
for invitation thank you

403
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,320
thank you

404
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,240
um

405
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,000
so i guess we move to the next talk

406
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,840
which is about meeting million dominion

407
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,320
attacks revisited with key recovery

408
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,640
collision and pretty much attacks

409
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,039
we the focus represented by charlie and

410
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,840
hua in collaboration with xiao xiao yong

411
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,240
tong si boissen chengdi

412
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,320
huang and

413
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,440
oh yeah

414
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,520
can you see my screen yes

415
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,919
oh okay okay thank you thank you for

416
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,720
introduction um i'm johnny i'm sorry to

417
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,960
be here and i wish you our people

418
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,880
meeting the middle attacks revisited

419
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,799
kill karma collision and play major text

420
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,080
firstly

421
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,160
i will introduce the meeting middle

422
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,200
pre-image attacks

423
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,080
like the figure shoes

424
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,320
the compression function is divided into

425
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,520
two parts

426
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,240
and the one is a forward chuck which can

427
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,320
be computed forward without knowing and

428
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,960
b

429
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,120
and the other is backward check which

430
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,520
can be computed backward without knowing

431
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,559
m8

432
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,400
and then we can mount the mitm attack

433
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,480
several technicals are proposed to

434
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,760
improve the attack such as price uncut

435
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,679
initial structure and partial match

436
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,200
at euro crypto 2021 the mit m3 major

437
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,720
attacks were still

438
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,480
thoroughly modeled as constraint

439
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,600
optimization problems by far exhale

440
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,160
unlike the figures

441
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,400
the forward chuck is from the starting

442
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,280
state

443
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
scnt and sk

444
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,240
lead to e plus

445
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,200
and the backward check is from sdnc and

446
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,880
skc

447
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,799
lead to e minus

448
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,880
partial match matches between the e plus

449
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,600
and the e minors

450
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,760
in their model neutral words of forward

451
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,640
and backward charge are denoted by blue

452
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,200
and red still no constants are denoted

453
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,360
by green step and unknown words are

454
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,080
denoted by white sale

455
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,120
the objective function is to maximize

456
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,760
minimum view of the remaining degree of

457
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,280
rhythm under the degree of match

458
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,960
and the degree of dof can be computed by

459
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,799
initial f minus 3 consumed dof where the

460
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,520
initial f is the number of rule and

461
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,640
ratio in the starting state denoted by

462
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,039
lambda plus and lambda minus

463
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,080
accumulate clf consumed in backward and

464
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,200
forward transaction as denoted by sigma

465
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,240
plus and sigma minus

466
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,760
and then we

467
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,840
and then i will

468
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,880
introduce our automatical mri atm kill

469
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,799
cover text

470
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,760
because our m is to recover key we need

471
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,280
to distinguish the initial dof and the

472
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,039
consumer dof who are from sdnc or skc

473
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,520
so we divide the lambda plus and sigma

474
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,080
plus two two parts

475
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,120
in our attack the full k space must be

476
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,240
tested

477
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,480
so the initial dll from sdnc should be

478
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,600
used up

479
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,520
while the

480
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,360
initial from the sk cannot be depleted

481
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,600
and then we apply our automatical model

482
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,880
of skinning

483
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,760
the structure of skinning is used here

484
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,480
in each one the state is updated with

485
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,000
substitutes and constants and run tweaky

486
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,159
shift rows and mixed columns

487
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,520
use model and solve it we finally

488
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,679
identify as 23 round mit mk recover

489
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,520
attack on screen n3n

490
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,320
besides we also analyze fox skinning a

491
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,480
summary of skinning and pop screening is

492
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,000
used in table

493
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,600
our attack is the first 23 run the

494
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,440
single key

495
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,880
on skinny and threading

496
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,919
finally i'll introduce mitm based

497
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,640
correlation tags

498
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,200
the definition of t bit partial target

499
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,120
for image attack is given iv and t bit

500
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,039
partial target of d

501
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,960
from m prime such that t bit of d prime

502
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,080
is the same as the tribute of t as the

503
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,720
same position and the other part of the

504
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,280
prime is randomly obtained

505
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,559
so if we have oracle a that that can

506
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,880
finally beat partial target prime with a

507
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,280
complexity of two two s

508
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,440
then we can construct a collision attack

509
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,720
with a complexity of two two s times two

510
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,280
to n minus t of two by calling a as

511
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,640
balls

512
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,919
first set t bit randomly date as

513
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,200
d prime

514
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,720
and then co a with ib and d prime

515
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,440
in two to n minus t of two times

516
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,320
after the procedure we have two to n

517
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,240
minus t over two

518
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,600
of n minus t with random date and thus

519
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,520
varying this

520
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,039
cleansing date with a high probability

521
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,760
according to this we give a algorithm

522
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,039
of a collision attack based on mitm

523
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,919
and use our algorithm

524
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,039
we

525
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,280
we found the college attack on sixth

526
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,520
round workflow and the sixth round was

527
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,480
two

528
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,400
two five six output transformation

529
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,480
besides we also found the collision

530
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,360
attack

531
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,320
on etron gross toe five one 512 output

532
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,960
transformation

533
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,279
and the summary of our result is

534
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,279
choosing stable

535
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,480
and that's all thank you

536
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
thank you very much

537
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,400
and

538
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
we move out we move on to the last talk

539
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,200
of

540
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,080
the session before the mini break

541
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,440
which will be given by daniel callister

542
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,200
it is in collaboration with nikola board

543
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,799
leon diamond and gilvan ash

544
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,480
and it is about

545
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,039
thinking outside the superbox i will let

546
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,799
daniel explain what that is

547
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,159
hello everyone thank you for the

548
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,360
introduction

549
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
and welcome to this talk about the paper

550
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,679
thinking outside the superbox so my name

551
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,000
is daniel kaisters and

552
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,840
as said this is joint work with nikola

553
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,039
board yolanda and shields

554
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,360
so actually this talk will be about the

555
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
interplay between design encrypt

556
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,559
analysis

557
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,080
and the central notion in our paper is

558
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,840
that of alignment

559
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,520
and to give a bit of an intuitive

560
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,440
feeling about what this means consider

561
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,960
the reindeer

562
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,200
block cipher upright operating on blocks

563
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,720
of 16 bytes

564
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,640
and randall with this block length is

565
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,799
also known as aes

566
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,720
it consists of four steps namely sub

567
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,760
bytes

568
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,240
shift rows mixed columns and at round

569
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,360
key

570
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,640
and what all of these steps have in

571
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,320
common is that they actually operate on

572
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,120
the level of bytes so they process bytes

573
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,559
in this figure you do not see the add

574
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,559
round key step because we have actually

575
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,919
transformed raindill into a

576
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,320
cryptographic permutation

577
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,039
by setting the key to zero

578
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,360
now sub bytes and shift rows commute so

579
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,200
let's swap them in this figure and then

580
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,760
you end up with this figure

581
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,960
here in the middle we see the

582
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,200
composition of shift rows

583
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,000
mixed columns and shift rows

584
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,080
and we can combine these three steps in

585
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,200
a single

586
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,640
large mixing block and call it m1

587
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,080
and this leads to the following

588
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,400
recursive structure

589
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,559
and here in the top left you see a box

590
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,320
consisting of the parallel application

591
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,720
of four s boxes followed by

592
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,200
a mixing layer m2 and

593
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
the parallel application of four s boxes

594
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,159
again

595
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,440
and this box is called a super box and

596
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,520
it can actually be thought of as a

597
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,279
bigger s-box

598
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,120
and if you take that point of view then

599
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,600
this structure can actually be seen as

600
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,840
again the parallel application of four

601
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,120
s boxes

602
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,640
which are bigger now

603
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,279
and a big mixing layer m1 and then the

604
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,679
parallel application for

605
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,360
boxes again

606
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
now this superbox structure combined

607
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
with a mixing layer that uses mds

608
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,279
matrices leads to

609
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,880
easy proofs on

610
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,640
the the bounce

611
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,000
on on

612
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,679
the trail weights for differential and

613
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,279
linear trail weight bounds

614
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,279
and these bounds are important in in the

615
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,760
context of arguably the

616
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,919
most powerful attacks on symmetric uh

617
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,840
crypto primitives namely

618
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,400
uh differential linear cryptanalysis

619
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,720
so intuitively if

620
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,480
a cipher has a

621
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,400
superbox structure then we call it

622
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,880
aligned

623
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,799
now the way that we define it

624
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,720
alignment is a binary property so either

625
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,880
a cipher is a line or it is not in which

626
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,360
case we call it unaligned

627
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,600
and in an underlined approach you

628
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,320
as a designer avoid any grouping of bits

629
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
when you design the round functions so

630
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,000
in many cases that means that there is

631
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,159
not a convenient combinatorial structure

632
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,279
in there that

633
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,039
makes it easy for you to

634
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,279
prove bounce on the trails so instead

635
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,200
you need to resort to computer programs

636
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,840
which in many cases are

637
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,080
running in exponential time so you can

638
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
only get so far

639
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,000
so superficially

640
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,240
it seems like a line ciphers are

641
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,080
better in many aspects than unaligned

642
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,960
ones

643
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,279
however one might ask then the question

644
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,840
why not every cipher is aligned is

645
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,279
designed according to an aligned

646
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,480
approach

647
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
so the general contribution of our paper

648
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,720
is really that we have pointed out a

649
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
number of side effects that show up when

650
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,440
you

651
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,760
are looking at an unlined cipher

652
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,200
and these side effects are potentially

653
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,360
unwanted and we've tried to quantify

654
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,080
them quantify them

655
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,919
so concretely we've looked at looked at

656
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,039
four

657
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,520
ciphers

658
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,360
and they differ in

659
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,760
their alignment properties

660
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,080
how strong their mixing layers are

661
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,760
different s-boxes the size of their

662
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,960
s-boxes

663
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,480
and note that the the version of

664
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,000
reindeer that we have considered is

665
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
actually the largest one so

666
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,279
that's the version on 256 bytes a bit

667
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,120
sorry

668
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,880
to make it easier to compare to the

669
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,159
others

670
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,600
it actually took quite a lot of time to

671
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,960
compute the metrics that you were

672
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,880
interested in for this

673
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,559
sample size

674
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,559
so in order to advance the study of

675
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,039
alignment we actually ask you to

676
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,039
increase the sample size

677
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,799
and to facilitate this we have made our

678
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,880
software available at the url that you

679
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,000
see here on the screen

680
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,320
on to the the main contributions

681
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,000
so we have studied the differential and

682
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,240
linear propagation properties of s box

683
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,840
based round functions

684
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,520
so if you looked at the linear layer in

685
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,840
isolation measuring it's it's

686
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,320
the absolute diffusion power but we've

687
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,840
also looked at a linear layer with

688
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,279
respect to a partition of the the space

689
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,399
of bits

690
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,200
defined by the s-box a

691
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,520
and in this context we introduce

692
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,760
the notion of huddling which is

693
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,600
the decay that you see when you move

694
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,159
from the bit weight to the box weight

695
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,000
where a bit weight is a metric that

696
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,600
counts the number of active bits so the

697
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
number of zeros in the state and the box

698
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,880
weight counts the number of active

699
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,960
s-boxes so s-boxes which have a non-zero

700
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,520
input difference or input mask

701
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,279
and we've also introduced the cluster

702
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,679
equivalence which is

703
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,399
related to the propagation of so-called

704
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,039
activity patterns through the the linear

705
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,520
layer and these turn out to be important

706
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,679
in the context of truncated differential

707
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,520
cryptanalysis

708
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,440
moreover we have

709
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,039
tried to give a formal definition of

710
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,520
what we mean by alignment

711
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,600
we've computed exact histograms of the

712
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
ciphers that we have considered and a

713
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,240
histogram

714
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
what we mean by histogram is basically

715
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,000
the

716
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,320
distribution of the number of states

717
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,679
trails differentials linear

718
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,399
approximations over their weights so we

719
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,240
have different histograms and we've

720
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,080
computed these for two round structures

721
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,120
and then

722
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,080
based on the the results there were two

723
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,760
ciphers that performed the best with

724
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,279
respect to the metrics that we have

725
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,919
looked at and these were saturn and zuru

726
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,600
so we actually repeated the same

727
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,320
exercise for these two cyphers

728
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,640
and finally we have done a qualitative

729
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,960
study of the differential propagation

730
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,039
aspects in sudo so so we've looked at

731
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,559
clustering of trills and three round

732
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,880
differentials

733
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
and found that actually

734
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,159
there is

735
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,640
no or little clustering in in zuru in

736
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,480
this case and we've looked at the

737
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,399
independence of round differentials in

738
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,480
three round trails right by independence

739
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,120
i mean that the differential probability

740
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,360
of a trail is actually exactly equal to

741
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,200
the product of the differential

742
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,600
probabilities of its round functions and

743
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,080
we found that for at least a three round

744
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,880
structure that we considered

745
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,080
all the round differentials were

746
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,519
independent

747
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,360
and with that i would like to conclude

748
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,559
and thank you for your attention

749
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,360
thank you

750
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,320
so we can move to the q a session

751
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,399
as a reminder everybody is welcome to

752
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,640
ask questions in the chat

753
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,200
there is a link in the zoom chat or you

754
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
can find it on the

755
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,159
conference portal

756
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,600
so

757
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,399
so far unless i missed it i didn't see a

758
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,919
question but i have a couple of

759
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,840
questions of my own

760
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,240
for the speakers so starting with the

761
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,480
the first article for may chain u

762
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,120
i was wondering um so you adapt your

763
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,519
attack to many different ciphers uh how

764
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,000
difficult is it to adapt the attack or

765
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,559
how generic is it

766
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,360
how

767
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,200
much did you need to fine-tune to adapt

768
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,480
the attack to all these different

769
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,159
ciphers

770
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:58,840
i'm

771
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,480
sorry

772
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,640
so you demonstrated your your

773
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,720
technique on many different ciphers on

774
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,080
many different targets i mean

775
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,760
you applied it you had many applications

776
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,120
yes

777
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,880
how much work was it to adapt the

778
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,159
general id to each of the targets

779
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,600
uh do you mean uh the difficulty between

780
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,640
different

781
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,080
uh

782
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,320
purpose for several

783
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,960
different different types of targets yes

784
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,200
okay uh thank you

785
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,519
thank you for your question

786
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,159
i know i think uh it depends on the

787
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,399
structure of the software and the

788
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,559
uh

789
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,679
for the stream suffer green uh ring one

790
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:44,720
uh

791
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,559
it represents the

792
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,120
f and fsi and uh

793
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,940
i think uh using

794
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,080
[Music]

795
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,200
uh the differential uh conditional

796
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,799
differential attack

797
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,640
is a good choice

798
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,480
but

799
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,640
the differential linear

800
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,679
attack may be

801
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,440
not as good as differential attack and

802
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,880
for the

803
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,600
but

804
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,360
for the for some other uh streaming

805
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,039
surfer uh the defender division in it uh

806
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,200
attack work a rugged swear

807
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,559
and

808
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,399
for pro server

809
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,399
such as a separate

810
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,120
uh

811
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,479
as far note the best

812
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,200
attack on the still suffice the

813
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,720
difficulty attack

814
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,919
and the

815
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,080
for the

816
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,840
for the as a dedicated

817
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,200
and uh

818
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,360
but for some in some

819
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,360
cases with limited data or

820
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,559
term completely it may be

821
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,200
works well

822
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,679
to include i think it depends on the

823
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,840
structure of the suffer but

824
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,760
not the types of suffering

825
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,280
uh this is my uh i don't know uh

826
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,159
well

827
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,719
uh you know whether i uh answered well

828
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,199
but uh i think you're questioning it

829
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:21,399
this is a good question and uh

830
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,199
thank you

831
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,560
you know because i was wondering for

832
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,239
example uh

833
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,760
it seems that your technique is pretty

834
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,679
accurate results in all cases and all

835
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,359
the applications that you give

836
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,639
that you give them

837
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,639
your estimation by your tool is quite

838
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,520
close to the experimental results

839
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,520
so i was wondering if that you expect

840
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,359
that it would be always the case or

841
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,760
there are maybe some targets that are

842
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,199
um

843
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,960
will be better than others but i guess

844
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,560
you you answered that already

845
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,199
i think

846
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,560
the estimate

847
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,280
value is is close to the experiment

848
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,320
rather

849
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,760
rarely

850
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,440
value but there are still some uh some

851
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,680
are still some gaps

852
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,640
uh

853
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,799
it depends on the case i think uh

854
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,599
it's difficult to

855
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,280
to

856
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,000
give

857
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,280
exactly

858
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,160
uh

859
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,560
estimates for the

860
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,800
real value

861
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,920
and this is three different servers uh

862
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,880
several uh

863
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,200
performance different

864
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,320
so

865
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,480
uh it's unthinkable

866
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,280
it's very difficult to answer a question

867
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,640
in general case i think

868
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,520
the question is

869
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,359
a record and then underneath the

870
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,359
furthest uh

871
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,720
research

872
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,400
okay thank you

873
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,720
thank you

874
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,880
so let me check

875
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,400
okay

876
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,000
yeah

877
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,359
okay since there's a question in the

878
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,200
chat i will be like that one so if that

879
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,160
question is for danielle

880
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,520
maybe you've seen it in the chat

881
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,200
so the question is the

882
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
strongest known examples of clustering

883
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,079
occur when all s-boxes are active

884
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,760
how does your approach

885
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,400
handle this

886
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,400
i would have to

887
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,440
counter with another question and namely

888
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,280
what what do you mean by handle this i

889
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,240
mean

890
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,320
um

891
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,920
welcome to join the

892
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,000
discussion if you want to clarify the

893
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
question

894
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,359
uh can you hear me

895
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,240
yes

896
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,359
okay good

897
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,880
uh no so i mean

898
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,359
um

899
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,240
well it seems like the

900
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,800
if you think about some things like uh

901
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,640
invariants

902
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,480
where for example you have a linear

903
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,760
invariant

904
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,040
you might have

905
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,960
so all the s boxes might be active so it

906
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,520
seems if you count only the weight

907
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,320
then

908
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,160
yeah i mean in this case the weight is

909
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,200
already maximum or very close to maximum

910
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,240
right so

911
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,720
that's what i mean by

912
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,720
how do you handle this like it's a bit

913
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,959
fake

914
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,200
um

915
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,839
i have to admit that i've indeed find it

916
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,440
a bit difficult to answer the question

917
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,240
um

918
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,119
i have to admit that many of these

919
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,480
say the tables that we present and

920
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,240
the histograms although they are

921
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,240
quantitative in some sense they're also

922
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,400
a bit qualitative because they kind of

923
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,560
give a hint of how things behave so it's

924
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,079
difficult to draw

925
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,320
very strong conclusions

926
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,240
um

927
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,119
but i don't know if maybe one of uh

928
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,599
say my co-authors uh has a better answer

929
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,960
to your question and if they would like

930
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,960
to chime in

931
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,000
yeah if you want i can step in

932
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
uh this is your

933
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,359
um so if you have uh many active s-boxes

934
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,440
then you get a lot of clustering indeed

935
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,640
and that's independent of uh

936
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,119
uh actually the the alignment or not

937
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,800
yeah that's what we call yes yeah that's

938
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
what i mean kind of yeah

939
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,400
so um

940
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,839
the point is actually in differential

941
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,760
linear clip analysis those cases are not

942
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,599
interesting

943
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,359
uh in this particular these particular

944
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,359
attacks so we really concentrate on the

945
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,119
resistance against differential linear

946
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,760
attacks and if you have a lot of s-boxes

947
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,560
active then you got a very uh

948
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,720
yeah the contribution of around

949
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,480
high very low dp or very low

950
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,640
why do you say these uh cases aren't

951
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,800
interesting in the case of uh linear and

952
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,400
differential gives analysis

953
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,960
because i think so

954
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,000
but

955
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,839
we have examples where

956
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,119
this happens right so is it because

957
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,960
uh it would

958
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,720
only work for a few number of keys or

959
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,400
how do you mean we have examples about

960
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,560
this right so so i mean

961
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,640
i mean just one example uh

962
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,920
maybe so in in uh meteor e64 you know

963
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,560
what is of course us

964
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,480
we have this kind of an example in

965
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,160
military 64

966
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,760
we have this kind of an example right

967
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,420
our sbox is active linear approximation

968
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,839
[Music]

969
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,920
yeah but i consider sound designs

970
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,760
yeah of course sound design stuff so if

971
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,440
you have all kinds of weaknesses built

972
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,280
into inside from the start side then

973
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,480
then yeah

974
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,040
you cannot do anything

975
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,359
so i guess my question there is uh how

976
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,359
does that sort of uh

977
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,839
relate to the alignment or is that the

978
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,040
case that's

979
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,359
that i mean that this idea of alignment

980
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,680
doesn't consider

981
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,200
no the alignment doesn't look at that

982
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,480
alignment

983
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,280
um we study it in the context of

984
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,839
clustering of trails mostly

985
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,839
and also this independence of our own

986
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,680
differentials those aspects that we

987
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,240
treat in paper actually yeah

988
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,160
that's where we of course alignment

989
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,839
probably has an impact a lot of things

990
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,599
too but that we didn't study that was

991
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,839
out of school

992
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,800
awesome we are running a little bit into

993
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
the mini break but since we started a

994
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
bit late because of the technical issues

995
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,680
i think it's okay to run a few minutes

996
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,079
into the mini break

997
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,680
uh let me check

998
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
so there's a question by andrei

999
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,040
schwarten

1000
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,800
about the paper meeting the middle

1001
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,200
attacks revisited

1002
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,119
the question is how much time did the

1003
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,640
solver take on average for your

1004
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,920
applications let's say on a single pc

1005
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,400
will take like seconds hours or days

1006
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,280
like what's the order of magnitude

1007
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,000
so i guess that question would be for

1008
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,880
charlie and juan

1009
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,520
sierlian do you hear the question

1010
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,319
uh okay

1011
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,440
so if italian is not available maybe

1012
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,359
this question can be handled

1013
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,040
on the chat

1014
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,760
or offline i mean

1015
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,040
by emails or something

1016
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,520
and

1017
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,200
yeah you would maybe just have one final

1018
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,319
question for your opinion

1019
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,800
you identify the critic critical flow

1020
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,359
for 2k f9

1021
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,880
do you have any idea how difficult it

1022
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,599
would be to fix

1023
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,280
is it difficult to say or

1024
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,720
you mean

1025
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,200
any idea to fix that to kf9 like how

1026
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,880
difficult do you

1027
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,240
do you expect that it might be difficult

1028
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,480
to fix or that yeah or do you maybe not

1029
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,880
know that's there

1030
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,839
i'm not sure i'm trying to fix it now

1031
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,079
but i think the maybe the common trick

1032
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,119
does not have here or maybe we need to

1033
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,960
invent some some new kinds of 2kf9

1034
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,640
but i think the the construct

1035
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,480
construction is elegant maybe

1036
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,760
i have no idea now but i think maybe

1037
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,880
there's some

1038
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,480
some small

1039
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,280
some small smart idea can help you to

1040
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,599
to to fix it

1041
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,920
so the answer i guess is difficult it's

1042
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,800
not

1043
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,720
obvious how to fix it okay thank you

1044
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,319
okay thank you

1045
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,319
i guess we can uh if there are no

1046
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,200
further questions

1047
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,240
and uh unless the charlie and hua is

1048
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,359
back

1049
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,359
we can move to the mini break

1050
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:03,040
and we will resume at

1051
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,520
i don't know what hour it is for you but

1052
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,480
at a minute
