00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,760
hello everyone

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,760
my name is daniel kaisters and i would

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,920
like to thank the organizers of crypto

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,680
2021

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,840
for the opportunity to present our paper

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,960
called thinking outside the superbox

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,599
this is joint work with nicola bora

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,279
dama and shiovanash

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,880
to motivate our work consider modes

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,119
modes are cryptographic algorithms that

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,599
take arbitrary length input and give

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,679
arbitrary length output

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,238
internally they make use of

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,559
a primitive and the primitives that we

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,320
have considered are cryptographic

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,840
permutations

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,000
these can be thought of as block ciphers

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
for which the key has been fixed

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,440
example of

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,520
an unkeyed primitive is the sponge

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,480
construction that you see on this slide

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,559
so the sponge construction is proven

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,399
secure if f

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,840
is a randomly and uniformly chosen

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,520
permutation and this means secure

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,920
against generic attacks that is to say

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,840
attacks that do not make use of any

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,360
primitive specific properties

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,000
an example of a keep mode

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,840
is the key to duplex

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,840
and the key duplex has

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,920
as well being proven secure against

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,799
generic attacks if

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,759
the primitive that is being used f is a

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,520
randomly and uniformly chosen

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,158
permutation

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,280
so these two examples show that the

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,159
design space traditionally is split into

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,640
two so on the one hand you have people

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,320
that design boats

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,880
built on top of ideal primitives

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,479
and on the other hand you have people

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,159
that try to

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,720
design the primitives to behave like

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,079
ideal ideal ones

46
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,520
however the latter cannot be formalized

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,840
so in practice assurance has to come

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,719
from crypt analytic evaluation of

49
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,360
round-reduced versions of f

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,320
possibly used within the mode

51
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,000
so this

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,318
requirement of behaving like an ideal

53
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,440
one is

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,000
quite strict and often maybe a little

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,160
bit too strict and it leads to

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,360
primitives that are over engineered and

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
quite resource heavy

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,720
so a recent trend has been to design

59
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,200
modes that take primitive specific

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,959
properties into account during the

61
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,879
design

62
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,040
an example of such a primitive aware

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,800
mode is the one that you see on this

64
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,000
slide namely far falling

65
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,879
so clearly

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,800
design and

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,959
crypt analysis are really intertwined

68
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,120
and this leads to the research question

69
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,519
that you see on this slide namely how do

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,280
the different designs of cryptographic

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,400
permutations affect grid analysis

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
so we've actually looked at both linear

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,000
and differential differential

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,599
cryptanalysis

75
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
however for this talk we will restrict

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,560
to differential cryptanalysis

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,319
so there are two things

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,280
design and script analysis and

79
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,200
we start by giving

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
a short overview of differential

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,640
cryptanalysis

82
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,720
just to make sure that everyone agrees

83
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,720
on the same definitions

84
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,120
so given a permutation f

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,319
we call a tuple a comma b where a is an

86
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,760
input difference

87
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,400
that propagates to an output difference

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,480
b through f a differential

89
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,720
and assigned to a differential is its

90
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,560
differential probability

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,200
also called the dp

92
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,920
and this is defined as the number of x

93
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,040
for which the equation f of x plus f of

94
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,599
x plus a equals v

95
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,000
falls relative to the total number of

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,159
different x

97
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,720
and an x which satisfies this equation

98
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,120
uniquely uniquely defines a pair x comma

99
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,200
x plus a that is set to follow the

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,120
differential

101
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,680
and because of the addition property of

102
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,519
the logarithm it is often more

103
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,000
convenient to work with the minus log 2

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,519
of the dp

105
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,439
and this is called the weight of the

106
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,719
differential a comma b

107
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,040
the primitives that we have considered

108
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
all have a similar structure

109
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,320
namely they are the composition of say

110
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,120
our round functions of the form

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,919
a nonlinear layer which is an s-box

112
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:36,880
layer

113
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,040
that is the parallel application of the

114
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
number of s-boxes

115
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,199
followed by a linear layer that is the

116
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,840
composition of a mixing layer m

117
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,759
and the shuffle layer p

118
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,479
and note that this mixing layer amp is

119
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,960
allowed to be the identity and in fact

120
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,040
one of the primitives that we have

121
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,960
considered uses a mixing layer that is

122
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,880
simply the identity

123
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,440
and the shuffle layer is just another

124
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,280
word that we use

125
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,039
for what is normally called a bit

126
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,039
permutation

127
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,240
and finally

128
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,560
this is followed by a translation which

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
is the addition of

130
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,240
a round constant to break up any

131
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,720
symmetries in the round

132
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,479
so typically the linear and the

133
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,240
non-linear layer are the same for each

134
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,800
round whereas the round constant is used

135
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,440
like i said to break these symmetries

136
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,759
so note that we have not considered

137
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,560
pistol structures or round functions

138
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,440
that are based on arcs so that is to say

139
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,120
round functions that make use of

140
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,560
additions rotations and excellent

141
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,199
so perhaps the following figure helps to

142
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,039
to illustrate

143
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,199
this composition so here you clearly see

144
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,440
that there is a first non-linear layer

145
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,720
consisting of

146
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,400
the parallel application of a number of

147
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,080
s boxes

148
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,759
and then we have drawn these boxes for

149
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,000
the three other layers maybe the mixing

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,400
layer the permutation layer and

151
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,720
the translation at the end

152
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
and we see that this

153
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
structure is repeated for the number of

154
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,600
rounds that has been chosen

155
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,360
given that the permutation is composed

156
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,319
of a number of rounds

157
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,000
it's possible to give a more precise

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,759
description of how the differences

159
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,840
propagate through this prediction

160
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,600
so in fact

161
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
we can specify an intermediate

162
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,520
difference so a difference for each

163
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,440
intermediate state in that

164
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,360
and this leads to an r plus one tuple of

165
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
differences where this r is the number

166
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,400
of rounds

167
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,919
and this is called a differential trail

168
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,160
but this is also known as a differential

169
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,120
characteristic depending on

170
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,240
which paper you read

171
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,080
and similar to the

172
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,360
differential

173
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,280
case

174
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,599
a dp or differential probability is

175
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,919
assigned to a differential trill

176
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,080
this is simply the number of input pairs

177
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,280
that follow each difference of the trail

178
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,880
relative to the total number of

179
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,599
different pairs

180
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,160
and again we define the weight of the

181
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,240
differential drill which is simply the

182
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,160
sum of the weights of the round

183
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,520
differentials

184
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,919
but this turns out to be equal to the

185
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,479
weights of the differentials of the

186
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,360
active s boxes so this is by definition

187
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,759
the case

188
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,280
so each

189
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,280
trail actually partitions the the set of

190
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,560
pairs that follow the differential

191
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,160
and if this

192
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,400
partition is non-trivial so if there are

193
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,080
multiple trails that share a

194
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,919
share the same input difference and the

195
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,759
same output difference

196
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,080
then we say that these trails cluster

197
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,120
within a differential

198
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
for the cyphers that we have considered

199
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,000
they differ in

200
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,280
one notion

201
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,440
that's we call alignment

202
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,520
well actually the notion of alignment

203
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,639
was coined by the ketchup designers in a

204
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,479
paper that was presented during the

205
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,720
ecrypt 2 hash workshop of 2011.

206
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
by means of how

207
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
differences propagate through the round

208
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,879
function so this

209
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,599
actually is a different definition than

210
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,759
the one that we present in our tape

211
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,440
so intuitively

212
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,199
you can think of

213
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,280
the bits being grouped along the s box

214
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
boundaries so for example bits are

215
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,159
grouped

216
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,719
in nibbles so four bits if the sbox has

217
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,159
size four or in bytes so a bits

218
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,839
if the s box has size eight

219
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,360
and when

220
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,560
the bits

221
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,959
in the round function are consistently

222
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,560
processed in these groups then we say

223
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,720
that the round function is a light

224
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,560
and if each round function is aligned we

225
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,279
call the entire primitive lines

226
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,519
so in the paper you can find a more

227
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,279
horrible definition of what we mean by

228
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,399
alignment

229
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,640
and from this definition it

230
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,440
immediately follows that there exists

231
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,880
something called a supervox substructure

232
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,040
and combining this superbox substructure

233
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,000
with

234
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
a mixing layer that is the parallel

235
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,120
application of an nds matrix

236
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,800
you can reason about the differential

237
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,320
properties of the cipher using

238
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,880
combinatorial arguments so in particular

239
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,160
this makes it possible to easily give

240
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,240
bounce on the trail weights

241
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,839
and this was one of the

242
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,080
i guess selling points of

243
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,519
aes

244
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,399
namely that it was resistant against

245
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,240
differential crypt analysis where the

246
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
argument was based on these

247
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,080
trill bounds

248
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,279
however

249
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,120
of course to be completely resistant

250
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,640
against differential clipped analysis

251
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,760
you need more than just drill bits

252
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,320
so again

253
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,000
this is a figure that hopefully

254
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,320
clarifies some of these things so here

255
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,080
you see again

256
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,920
a layer of

257
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,680
s boxes

258
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,079
and compared to the previous figure the

259
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,320
mixing day here is actually split into a

260
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,399
number of

261
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,760
sub

262
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,480
functions if you want to call than that

263
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,200
that are nicely aligned along the s box

264
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,720
boundaries

265
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,040
and they are followed by a shuffle layer

266
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,200
so a bit permutation and what you cannot

267
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,360
see in this picture because it was a bit

268
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,800
difficult to draw

269
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,680
is that this the shuffle layer actually

270
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,800
shuffles the bits in groups so i mean

271
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,959
that if

272
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,760
the bits belong to one group then the

273
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,440
group as a whole is moved to a different

274
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
position

275
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,120
and then the shuffle layer is followed

276
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,880
by a group

277
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,160
wise

278
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,640
addition of a constant and then

279
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,040
this structure is repeated for

280
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,839
the other runs

281
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,959
so clearly if there is an aligned

282
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,920
approach

283
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,760
it should not come as a surprise that

284
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,519
there's also something that we call an

285
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,120
underlined approach

286
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,000
and in an unaligned approach

287
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,120
the idea is to avoid any such groupings

288
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,000
when designing the round functions

289
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,839
so in general although there are

290
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,839
exceptions to this case this means that

291
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,360
you need computer programs to

292
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,399
investigate the trail bounce

293
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,519
but this naturally leads to the question

294
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,600
if it seems like there are only

295
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,839
advantages advantages to using the

296
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,240
aligned approach why is not every cipher

297
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,519
designed with

298
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,839
an aligned approach and in fact

299
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,920
many cypress are indeed designed

300
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,240
according to an aligned approach

301
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,839
but it turns out that an enlightened

302
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,240
approach may have some potentially

303
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,959
unwanted side effects

304
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,319
and in the paper we

305
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,320
mentioned some of these side effects and

306
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,120
we have generated a lot of data for four

307
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,079
different primitives

308
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,839
to actually quantify these side effects

309
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,079
and the four primitives that we have

310
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,160
considered you can see in this table

311
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,040
actually

312
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,120
in this table there are some

313
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
block ciphers but these block ciphers

314
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,680
have been transformed into a permutation

315
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,360
by fixing the key to the constant zero

316
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
so the first primitive that we have

317
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,760
considered is raita

318
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,839
and actually this is a somewhat modified

319
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,160
version of greendale in that it's its

320
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,079
width is larger than what you would

321
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,360
typically see namely 256 bits

322
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,279
so according to our definition giandal

323
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,399
is a light

324
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,279
it has a strong mixing layer and its

325
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,440
box works on bytes so

326
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,279
it has size 8.

327
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,440
and there are 32 of such s boxes

328
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,160
corresponding to a width of 256 bits

329
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,440
the second cipher that we have

330
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,200
considered is saturn

331
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,680
which can be thought of as a

332
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,480
more modern reindeer

333
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,839
according to our definition it is

334
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,040
aligned

335
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,959
it has a strong mixing layer and it

336
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,560
works on nibbles

337
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,600
so that means groups of four bits

338
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,320
there are 64 such as boxes

339
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,200
corresponding to a width of 256 bits

340
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,480
so third

341
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,880
we have looked at sponges which again

342
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,360
according to our definition is the light

343
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,600
it has a weak mixing layer because the

344
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
mixing layer is simply the identity

345
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,440
function

346
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,240
and it works on nibbles so for this

347
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,440
and there are 96 of such s boxes

348
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,920
corresponding to a width of 384 bits

349
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,279
and finally we have looked at

350
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,760
fermentation zuru

351
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,720
zuru is an example of

352
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,320
a permutation that follows the

353
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,920
underlined approach

354
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,839
it has a strong mixing layer and it has

355
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,480
a rather small s book size because it

356
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,040
works on three on

357
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,959
groups of three bits

358
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,519
and there are 128 of such s boxes

359
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,199
corresponding to a width of 384 bits

360
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,399
so clearly

361
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,279
we have a sample space of only four

362
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,839
ciphers

363
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,160
but already this

364
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,959
took quite a lot of work

365
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,440
so in order to increase the sample space

366
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,680
we would like you to also work on this

367
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,959
so please

368
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,240
expand this

369
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,120
this sample space

370
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,639
and in order to help you with this we

371
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,880
have made our software available at the

372
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,279
following url

373
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,880
so let's now compare

374
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,839
an aligned approach

375
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,519
with the underlined approach in a more

376
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,920
quantitative way

377
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,760
so the differential probability of a

378
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,880
drill can be approximated

379
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,199
by the product of the dps of the active

380
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,160
s-boxes so an s-box is active if

381
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
the input difference to that s-box is

382
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,320
not zero

383
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,279
and actually if equality holds then we

384
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,279
say that the round differentials are

385
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,920
independent

386
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,639
so

387
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,000
when does a trill have a low

388
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,760
differential probability

389
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,839
either if there are not many s-boxes

390
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,279
active

391
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,160
or

392
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,839
the s-boxes

393
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,760
have a very high db or of course both

394
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,839
and the idea behind the white trail

395
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,920
strategy is to ensure that all trails

396
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,519
have many active s-boxes

397
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,880
so

398
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,600
intuitively you you take your mixing

399
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,199
layer and you look at

400
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,160
its input and its output

401
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,959
and you want to make sure that

402
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,800
in the tuple of

403
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
both as input and output

404
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,240
there are many active s boxes

405
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,079
so in particular if there are very few

406
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,639
active s boxes in the input a

407
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,000
then you would like to make sure there

408
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,720
are many active s boxes in the output m

409
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,680
of a

410
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,600
and if there are a few active s boxes in

411
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,440
the output b they would like to make

412
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,040
sure that there are

413
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,880
many active s boxes at the input so

414
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,839
an inverse of b

415
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,639
so

416
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,120
a natural thought is to consider the

417
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,680
whole distribution over all the known

418
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,959
zero a's of the box weight of a

419
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,959
plus the box weight of m of a where the

420
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,199
box rate is simply the measure that

421
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,480
counts the number of test boxes

422
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,440
and

423
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,360
the minimum is called the branch number

424
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,759
and this gives

425
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,199
a way of

426
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,599
kind of

427
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,639
lower bounding the number of s-boxes

428
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,040
that are always present in the round

429
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,040
function

430
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,800
but

431
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,199
the branch number can actually be seen

432
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,399
as

433
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,199
the minimum of well

434
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,199
this distribution so

435
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,199
actually of something that you could

436
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,880
present in a histogram

437
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,119
and here you see two such histograms so

438
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,199
on the one hand you have

439
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,720
the bit weight histogram and on the

440
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,839
other hand you have the box rate

441
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,599
histogram

442
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,359
so the bit weight histogram shows the

443
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,199
number of states

444
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,119
distributed over the different bit

445
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,559
weights

446
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,400
and this gives a measure of the

447
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
diffusion power of

448
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,559
the mixing layer without regard for the

449
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,360
sbox layer

450
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,760
and a good

451
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,000
bit weight histogram starts far to the

452
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
right

453
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
and it is quite flat in the sense that

454
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,400
if you

455
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,559
were to think of these these histograms

456
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,880
as continuous lines you would like the

457
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,840
slope to be quite small

458
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,919
and then we actually recover the bit

459
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,840
weight branch number as the starting

460
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,120
value

461
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,200
of this histogram

462
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,520
the null zero starting building so for

463
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,120
example

464
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,760
here something there starts at five so

465
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,840
it's bit weight branch number is fine

466
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,880
and then we have the box weight

467
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,880
histogram

468
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,280
which shows the number of states

469
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,520
distributed over the box weights

470
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,840
and again we want these histograms to be

471
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,799
flat and start far to the right

472
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,960
and the smallest

473
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,840
value so the starting value is the

474
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,400
box weight branch number so for example

475
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,760
for example reindeer has a box weight

476
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,799
branch number of pi

477
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,720
so clearly we see that in moving from

478
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,320
the bit weight to the box wave

479
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,400
the graphs are kind of shifted upwards

480
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,799
so there is a loss of diffusion in going

481
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,320
from the bit weight to the box weight

482
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,799
and this phenomenon is that

483
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,760
so we call this phenomenon huddling

484
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,440
and in general huddling increases with

485
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,679
the sbook size however we found that

486
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,919
it's more pronounced in the light side

487
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,280
by the way

488
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,840
the box weight is also a very nice way

489
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,919
of

490
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,840
predicting what happens

491
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,000
in the case of two rounds differential

492
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,160
trails the trail weights to be more

493
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,640
specific

494
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,799
and in this slide we see the

495
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,039
differential trail rate histogram versus

496
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,360
the differential weight histogram

497
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,120
so on the left we have the number of

498
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,640
trails versus the the trail weight

499
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,000
and on the right we have the number of

500
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,080
differentials first of the differential

501
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,160
rate and again we see that in moving

502
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,720
from the trail weight histogram to the

503
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,960
differential weight histogram

504
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,400
that these

505
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,600
histograms are slightly shifted upwards

506
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,320
and this is the result of the fact that

507
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,000
within a differential there can be

508
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,760
clustering so

509
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,559
multiple trails that have the same

510
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,880
input and output difference

511
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,640
and they all contribute to the

512
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,039
differential weight

513
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,200
so clearly

514
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,600
the further a histogram is shifted

515
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,760
upwards the more it says suffers from

516
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,520
clustering

517
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,799
and we found out that this effect is

518
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,039
again more pronounced in the line cycles

519
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,039
of course we have done more than just

520
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,120
this

521
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,640
so as i already mentioned in the

522
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,240
beginning in addition to the

523
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
differential propagation properties we

524
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,600
have also

525
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,960
computed

526
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,440
or looked at the linear propagation

527
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
properties

528
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,880
and have computed the two round

529
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,880
histograms of the four cyphers in that

530
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,200
case

531
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
and looking at these histograms there

532
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,000
were two clear

533
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,280
winners say

534
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,159
namely saturna and zulu so cyphers

535
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,840
that's performed the best with respect

536
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,120
to this metric

537
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,880
and for these two ciphers we have

538
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,320
computed the three round trail

539
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,480
histograms just to see how they compare

540
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,840
it in that regard

541
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,480
moreover we also looked at whether the

542
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,520
approximation of the dp of the trail

543
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,960
by the product of the dps of its active

544
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,039
s boxes

545
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,880
is an equality or not so whether this is

546
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,039
a good approximation or not and as i

547
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,200
already mentioned this is related to the

548
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,159
independence of the round differentials

549
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,640
and for three rounds of zulu we actually

550
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,559
have looked at this independence and

551
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,039
found out that for zulu there is

552
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,879
independence of the round differentials

553
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,080
moreover based on available information

554
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,360
so that means

555
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,760
looking at the existing literature

556
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,720
and

557
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,640
doing some back of the envelope

558
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,400
calculation

559
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,760
we have sketched what happens when

560
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,440
considering the weight histograms of

561
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,640
four rounds and beyond

562
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,080
and actually what we found out is that

563
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,400
given the same computational resources

564
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,159
so not looking at the same number of

565
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,880
rounds because clearly

566
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,559
one round

567
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,280
implemented on some architecture

568
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,880
can be a lot more

569
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,480
resource heavy than

570
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,640
the route of another cypher implemented

571
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,880
on the same architecture given the same

572
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,799
number of rounds we have found that zulu

573
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,480
actually performs the best with respect

574
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,919
to the differential and the linear

575
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,480
propagation properties

576
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,120
so this concludes our presentation

577
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,799
and we would like to thank you for your

578
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,600
attention
