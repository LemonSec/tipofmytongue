codebook  attacks

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,590
so I pretend die sweeney the tweak

27
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,940

so

41
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,000
that for

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,400
is the extra you don't come

case of f3 is closed and the is in it is

50
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,730
my motto in an overpriced and

51
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,130
types of sintje and workshop and

52
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,040
they write domains ice

53
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,860
and

54
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,400
the most important thing  about

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,910
boot of those numbers is that the tweak

56
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,370
can be split into two cards which also all

57
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,560
the left and right brides that all that

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,030
arm

59
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,090
so this us in an alternating

60
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,910
so free sample all the car by the way mike

61
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,820

like us or

63
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,650
and and this copies and enjoy the

64
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,200
idea labels these attacks one becomes in

65
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,180
the red bodacious is that the functions of

66
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,300

67
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,400
your for the puppies or digital peaks

68
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,510

69
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,870
you form and the functions

70
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,120
that zaki dependent  practical port

71
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,650
specific construction for that

72
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,870


73
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,900
so for context costs half 10 review

74
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,030
attacks already received seven tips and

75

114
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,970
practical relevance

115
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,630
your characters in this work or generic in the

116
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,330

general

118
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,720
but

119
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,720
who use the specific on the ie that the

120
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,000
tweaks alternate

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,010
and the de did complexities or these

122
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,960
characters will be about the square root or

123
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,080
the animals complex die or private

124
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,120
asap so they are quite  big improvement and

125
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,300
in fact how so that it is minimum 1 size

126
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,030
requirement or when your

127
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,020
is

128
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,740
colombus friend so and fast we start the

129
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,360
high-level overview of the app which

130
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,190
doesn't require any need of nice

131
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,440
tenellus and if she did oh go into

132
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,870
more details

133
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,830
so

134
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,650
busy on the i because the baby booties de

135
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,980
tjeerd ecolizer is

136
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,900
doll or small one shape and

137
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,460
top functions

138
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,540
so angry etc

139
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,750
sample oil sample uniform and informs

140
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,680
random

141
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,140
in function which takes for beach for

142
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,220
beats

143
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,290
so for myself search function switch

144
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,430
movie cm  try this now suddenly offer

145
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,920
many lures that output distribution or

146
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,840
time function at output is your shower

147
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,330
mommy in for each output that

148
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,520
input sarda title the map to this

149
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,400

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,270
and

152
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,080
because in sidonia that is

153
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,250
distribution this  up it is too expensive his

154
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,070
teachers look very June morning

155
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,110
now the function is just be a large function

156
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,510

that is borrow combination lizzie oh meines

180
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,290

181
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,020
kind of girls is feasible ties

182
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,850

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,600
and on it i justin in this fast is

185
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,170
so

186
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,970
you who behind the attacks is that i  a

187
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,250
ficus a half or the tweak something like a

188
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,900

189
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,300
's really hot a private school

192
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,330
it is type  me in light ball hall

193
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,210
for with the seven tips

194
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,840
so the course where it your pieces skirting

195
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,530
the output of f warm red and b300

outside

198
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,219
so by then this is the output is that

using i by the way is for

210
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,450
so close and then i have a shown

211
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,600
that has some basic knowledge big

212
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,750
tenellus is

213
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,510
it is a makes it easy to explain the

214
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,420
detailed and everything is

215
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,430
so

216
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,990
we have  focus via one this is 4

217
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,150

dislikes analyze or fast is

222
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,190
so

223
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,170
you could villanous beast

224
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,930

maschio nou the college of discreate

228
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,820
in the second round something because i it is

229
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,720
sick and bars this no active and in

230
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,960
the found for i don't know what the college

231
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,520
no stickers that the pen zombie key

bit sour see hair of the pi  cost that

233
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,390
you is ficus who note out of

234
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,319
it is a small

235
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,580
function that also slacker uniform and the

236
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,330
man and anyway the distribution of this

237
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,340
course can be known fact that easy going

238
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,530
to biography normal who can enter the

239
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,300

kolere

242
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,280
and conclusion time

243
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,360
it's quite likely that i like

244
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,060
for simplicity here already dust work would

245
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,820
expect square colleague by de doen in

246
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,740
the college

247
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,450
well it's over and for the first

248
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,630
round one second round they

249
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,300
developed everywhere in expected squared

250
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,880
correlation of om de  continue by and of

252
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,970
and there it is very simple test my

bike ride over the plaintext

255
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,000
and then in the flash drive the sandwiches

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,150
stars constant the left brandy and

257
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,420
something like that keyless entry the first round and

258
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,000
that sense in crisis that effect the script

259
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,980
college side effects or and so

00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,499
logical or well known for ineke canal

262
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:27,569
is that chip i wanna about the square

263
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:29,639
the college or that approximation de or

264
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,870
using

265
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,410
it  we can use it this case

266
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,459
i chose

267
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:36,209
that

268
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:38,639
college here is unknown who to linoli

269
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,309
get lost get away where this erased

270
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:44,069
iq mates plugin that everett

271
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:46,860
henriette and build or about when is

272
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,309
my walls they did complex tea and you

273
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,490
can or chose the mountains  and beautiful I am

274
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,920
also learning whether those cities are complex it is

275
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,930
so he would show plotting whether the maximum

276
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,309
from found it

277
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:02,069
the maxims successful beauty meines false

278
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:03,300
positive drove

279
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,040
this cambuur has advantages amount of

280
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,829
dating or something in the case or via one you

281
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:10,829
can see it  the surgeon here to

282
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:14,720
discreetly grasp us

283
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,959
and determine if its about between six

284
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,600
months one day 2012 5 meters

285
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,059
and what you do ie here however is that i

286
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:30,329
for large amount of tt doon t creative

287
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,819
the voltage shape and di  gi people see my

288
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,129
chest fold-down bed succeed in choosing the

289
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,459
mosque week is chuse marsh end and it

290
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,889
might just made him up this to have

291
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:43,639
large king

292
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:46,079
door guido is it

293
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,240
houses quite a life so there must be

294
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,649
some cyst him but

295
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:53,870
some of the mind distress

296
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,389
of  course i can just use multiple

297
00:12:57,389 --> 00:12:58,920
masks

298
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,990
anyway the en hand' is smart

299
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,089
mister complexity tasted this diet baby

300
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:07,370
hain't the multi those magic minutes

301
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,710
so in a multi time eveline is timo

302
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,890
show

303
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,740
who cpu is already in also have siemens

304
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,310
that we  her bottle or that for ni maschi

305
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,980
and it also built multi that people

306
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,870
had and bumps politics it and everything

307
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,850
is very pico's so there of all the smile

308
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,950
see like effects space

309
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,280
this will have na is consistent

310
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,730
persist so teams i can be

311
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,730
implemented

312
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,160
so self first  measurement that absolutely

313
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,950
come to you that simple linear time

314
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,140
who channel estimate for evening at or

315
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,180
so lost colleges

316
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,260
end when compared close success holt

317
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,090
for this is team girl and the did

318
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,280
complexities of this approach is ass  je

319
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,040
bouten square of en divided by the some

320
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,440
of those crash course economics don't

321
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,380
know what some scratch queen devion

322
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,850
that never savage

323
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,430
you mystical lily white large and

324
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,140
then be kept it's how have this

325
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,970
completely rebuilt and build

326
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,760
over when my  iphone 5 covers tear

327
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,770
the ven berg the

328
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,320
simple

329
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,260
is caravan here an effect there is because

330
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,110
we don't know the actual bicycle teak oil

331
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:30,890
give me your them to be able to better

332
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,520
so and i want a 2 is the management

333
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,150
i chose the mars from effects  space is

334
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,100
an eyes grievous way of describing

335
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,630
and

336
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,960
that specific guys issue you

337
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,700
have to case anyway

338
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,620
so like before bigquery

339
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,080

00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:32,169
this case the scriptures by the phantom

's a show

465
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:42,460
because of this i know that the cipher

466
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,640
text is it uniformity happens and

467
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,309
with it i would test an app that fondo

468
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:51,340
with so distributions who connection' week

469

473
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:05,140
so on this task requires built and

477
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,840
so om i know you  can do where i
