1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,800
and you can start the session

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,320
okay

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,759
okay so uh hi everyone um and welcome to

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,759
the uh session about uh quantum

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,960
cryptography

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,199
uh the first uh sub-session there will

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,560
be another one

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,600
um

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,320
so uh let me just say uh how it's going

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,480
to go uh we're going to leave the

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,519
five-minute talks back-to-back and then

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,000
the end until the the break or the mini

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,520
break uh we're going to uh

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,719
ask questions um and i'm going to uh

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,559
allow people to raise their hands and

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,320
just like ask

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,120
zoom in person um and if there are no

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,039
questions there then we'll go to the

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,160
zulu and now kay will put the the zulip

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,280
link in the chat box so you can go there

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,160
uh but please make sure to say who

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,680
you're addressing the question too in

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,600
case you know i pick it up later or

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
asking a question during the talk so

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,559
that i'll know who to address it too um

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,520
okay great so uh let's start

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,280
um and our first talk is uh

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,040
about a black box approach to post

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,560
quantum zero knowledge

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,040
in constant uh rounds

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,560
uh by niwi chia kai ming chang and

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,240
takashi yamakawa

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,439
and now we will be uh giving the talk so

34
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,119
uh my way the stage is yours

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,479
yeah thank you thank you for the

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,799
introduction yeah this is a joint world

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,200
with timing joining the takashi yamakawa

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,960
and because this time is not good for

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,799
taiwan and japan so i give this talk

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,040
here

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,840
so in this world we are trying to study

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,159
in the problem of constant reality decay

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,360
protocol

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,280
so briefly the decay protocol is that

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,040
you need to satisfy components and

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,799
summaries of the language which means

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,479
that if acting out the approval cannot

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,719
convince the verifier and if x is

49
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,439
denying l then either we consider

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,759
unbounded proofer then the open improver

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,360
cannot convince it then we call it a

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,040
statistical stun

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,600
and if we only complete the efficient

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,280
proofer and the efficient proofer cannot

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
convince the verifier and we call it

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,800
computational sound

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,360
then for vk property which means that if

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,319
x is in l we can only learn the axis in

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,560
l which means that uh the the verify

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,959
cannot do anything other than x with

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,800
like the witness or the proof of

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,319
behavior

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,680
so

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,840
uh more firmly which means that there is

65
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,920
an efficient simulator f for any

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,319
efficient malicious verified v star for

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,480
any efficient distinguisher the

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,280
distinguisher cannot distinguish p and s

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,480
with

70
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,720
with more than the critical

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,800
probability

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,360
and also in this world we are if people

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,239
want to have the the wrong contextual

74
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,040
wrong capacity to be as much as possible

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,920
so here we only allow p and v exchange

76
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,680
constant messages of course for each

77
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,480
message it can be like polynomial

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,720
but it can not be

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,319
it cannot exist uh constant messages

80
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,280
so

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,480
and critically as we have such protocols

82
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,440
like

83
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,159
uh gorai kahan makauli and the witches

84
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,400
and in 1986 we have a polly round uh dk

85
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,480
proof based on one-way function

86
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,480
in 1996 garage gives the background dk

87
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,440
proof which based on collect collision

88
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,879
resistant hash

89
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,640
and then in 1997 earlier jacobsen and

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,760
the young give the ck argument only four

91
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,040
rounds based on one wave function

92
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,760
however you can check that for here the

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,519
the original liquid probably configure

94
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,239
all have like classical adversaries and

95
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,159
the classical stimulator and classical

96
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,798
distinguish

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
so now because we may have quantum

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,400
computers in the future then the

99
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,480
question is why if all the adversaries

100
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,439
have uh have quantum power

101
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,439
so like here we are considering pulse

102
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,239
quantum constant on vk for mp so it is a

103
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,000
classical decal protocol which means

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,159
that all the interaction between the

105
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,680
prover and the verifier are still

106
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,840
classical however we consider the

107
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,319
malaysian adversary to be like quantum

108
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,079
like quantum malicious proofer for

109
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,399
conventional soundings and

110
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,199
quantum relations verify for zero large

111
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,400
properties

112
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,000
and also become the equivalent simulator

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,240
and the point and distinguish

114
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,720
and yes this has been studied before

115
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,120
like washrooms in 2005 give the first

116
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,240
poly round uh dk proof based on one-way

117
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,199
function

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,919
and

119
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,400
last year mike ptensky and schumui give

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,160
the constant raw detail argument

121
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,199
based on qlw and the qf actually and

122
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,160
they're based on some very very very

123
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,840
very excellent

124
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,240
non-interactive uh sorry non-playback

125
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,320
techniques

126
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,240
so now you may wonder like can we

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,000
achieve constant wrong consequences

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,840
decay with weaker assumptions because

129
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,000
that qrw and q plus qfhe are stronger

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,919
than like previous assumptions we know

131
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,520
for classical case

132
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,600
and also can we just have bad bound

133
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,199
stimulation

134
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,280
so now we are trying to achieve all of

135
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,759
these three uh at once like constant

136
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,600
wrong possibilities decay weaker

137
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,160
assumption and the very bad stimulation

138
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,919
and in this world we show that yes you

139
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,600
can achieve all of that at the cost of

140
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,160
returning the decay property to epsilon

141
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,520
decay

142
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,400
so in this world we give two protocols

143
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,160
the first one showing that assuming

144
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,039
quantum lwe there exists a post quantum

145
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,680
playback five raw epsilon dk proof for

146
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,720
mp

147
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,400
and the second result shown that

148
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,000
assuming quentin's secure one-way

149
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,919
function there is a post quantum

150
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,400
playback nylon epsilon dk argument for

151
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,600
np

152
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,639
so here the definition of epsilon zk is

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,600
as follows for all epson which is

154
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,960
noticeable lex is an efficient simulator

155
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,479
x for all efficient uh distinguishable d

156
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,319
the distinguishing creature cannot

157
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,039
distinguish proverbs on a simulator with

158
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,400
probability greater than epsilon

159
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,919
okay

160
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,919
and so here we add our results to this

161
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,960
table

162
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,520
so our first result showing a five round

163
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,720
decay proof based on lw quantile

164
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,960
actually it is based on collapsing

165
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
hashing by those collapsing hash it can

166
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,080
be implemented by qrw so you can also

167
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,120
say it is based on qrw

168
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,280
and the second result is the nyron vk

169
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,680
argument other epsilon zika argument

170
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,039
based on one wave function

171
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,639
and i just want to like give some um

172
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,479
some ideas about our

173
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,919
our simulation

174
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,400
so row phase measure idea is as follows

175
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
so you still use the framework of the

176
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,520
protocol by correct high in 1996 which

177
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,960
is a full method for long protocol

178
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,199
and the simulator built two algorithms

179
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,360
steam avoidance number for abortion

180
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
number of being cases which is the same

181
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
as the one by potency and trimling in

182
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,680
2020

183
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,000
and the simulator aboard the normal

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
aboard only succeed when we start a

185
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,919
portal now then i think the most

186
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,400
technical part is that how do we do for

187
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,520
signal abort like here uh we just break

188
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,000
back quantum rewind into is try the b

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,880
start challenge

190
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,199
and then i also want to mention that

191
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,880
alpha art work

192
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,319
with timing takashi and the chip home we

193
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,840
show that the constant wrong post

194
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,160
questions dk in the impossible under

195
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,080
assumption that you should be in rb and

196
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,479
p also here is a constant raw playback

197
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,400
post quantum decay so you can still have

198
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,240
num playback one but the very best one

199
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,120
is impossible if you believe that bqp is

200
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,639
not empty

201
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,319
so therefore if you want to achieve

202
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,840
constant wrong consequences zero

203
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,919
knowledge then we need either not

204
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,720
playback techniques like ps20 or

205
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,639
relaxing zero nitrogen epsilon zero

206
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,520
energy large

207
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,160
this is what this work has done

208
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,120
okay

209
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,440
and that's all thank you

210
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,400
okay

211
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,440
uh thanks a lot uh naive um

212
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,080
we return these questions uh later on

213
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,840
uh so let's move uh to our uh next talk

214
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,759
um which is going to be about a

215
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,680
concurrent composition of quantum zero

216
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,639
knowledge uh by paul banjan anand kaimin

217
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,720
chang and rolando la placa and uh banjan

218
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,199
is going to be giving the talk

219
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,800
so go ahead

220
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,759
can you see my screen

221
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,599
okay

222
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,200
can you see my screen

223
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
video yep okay thanks man uh so i'm

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,679
going to talk about quantum zero

225
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,839
knowledge in the concurrent composition

226
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,919
setting this is a joint work with uh

227
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,519
kaimen chung and brando laplaca

228
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,920
so in the past few years there have been

229
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,680
tremendous developments in designing

230
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,320
quantum computers and we need to brace

231
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,720
ourselves towards the possibility that

232
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,240
quantum computers will be built in the

233
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,519
coming decades

234
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,440
and as cryptographers our goal is to

235
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
design crypto systems that will be

236
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,839
secure even after quantum computers come

237
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,000
into existence

238
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,480
and i'm going to focus on one such

239
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,720
perimeter which is zero knowledge

240
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,399
so i'm going to look at the notion of

241
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
zero knowledge that is secure even if

242
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,440
quantum computers exist

243
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,839
and this is called as quantum zero

244
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,760
knowledge um roughly speaking what it

245
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,920
says is that the conversation between

246
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,000
the prover and the quantum verifier

247
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,920
can actually be simulated by a quantum

248
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,120
simulator

249
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
so whatever quantum verifier can learn

250
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,800
by interacting with the prover it can be

251
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,200
simulated by by quantum polynomial time

252
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,680
algorithm

253
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,920
and um this

254
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,240
notion has been considered in prior

255
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,200
works

256
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,720
and most of the prior works have focused

257
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,040
on the standalone study

258
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
in this setting we assume that

259
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,240
the prover uh talks to only one verifier

260
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,360
at a time

261
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,959
in other words the protocol execution

262
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,000
happens in isolation

263
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,680
and the good news is that there are some

264
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,240
feasibility results now in this in this

265
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,160
with in this assumption

266
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640
however uh assuming that the prover only

267
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,880
talks to one verifier at a time is not a

268
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,760
realistic assumption

269
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,640
a more realistic setting that we can

270
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,680
consider is the setting of concurrency

271
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,519
uh and in this setting

272
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,279
the prover could be talking to multiple

273
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,200
verifiers at the same time

274
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,880
and the verifiers can interleave their

275
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,040
messages to the brewer in any

276
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,839
arbitrary fashion

277
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,920
and we want the

278
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,800
notion of zero noise to still hold in

279
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,620
this setting

280
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,519
[Music]

281
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,920
so what do we know about concurrent q z

282
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,800
k

283
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,040
not much so

284
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
the qck has hardly been studied in the

285
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,000
concurrent composition setting

286
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,160
so in contrast uh in the classical

287
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,240
setting there have been

288
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,480
many many many works on

289
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,279
concurrent zk

290
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,680
so to correct this

291
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,480
rather sad state of affairs uh

292
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,279
in this work we uh consider the notion

293
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,320
of concurrent quantum technology

294
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,720
so this is defined analogous to the

295
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,920
notion of uh cusick in the the

296
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,279
concurrent decay in the classical

297
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,959
setting except that we are now

298
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,440
considering quantum verifiers uh so we

299
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,839
have a quantum polynomial algorithm uh

300
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,560
let me call it v star

301
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,440
that also takes as input

302
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,800
you know

303
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,399
a polynomial number of qubits

304
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,560
that's quantum advice and then it can

305
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,000
invoke q verifiers uh or we can call

306
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,360
them sessions

307
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,839
that interact with the proverb right and

308
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,600
again they can interleave their messages

309
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,519
in any um

310
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,279
in any manner they want

311
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,639
and we want the zero knowledge

312
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,240
properties to still hold

313
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
so there are two notions of concurrent

314
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,760
quantum zero knowledge we can consider

315
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,920
here one is bounded concurrency and

316
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,240
another one is unbounded concurrency

317
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,720
so in the bounded concurrency setting uh

318
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,079
the queue the parameter q is fixed

319
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,279
as part of the protocol description

320
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,399
so for example the communication

321
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,839
and the computational complexity could

322
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,560
depend on this key

323
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,680
unbounded concurrency which is a

324
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,040
stronger setting doesn't have this

325
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,200
restriction the queue can be decided by

326
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,880
the adversary dynamically

327
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,920
okay so let me state our results so we

328
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,320
initiate the formal study of concurrent

329
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,000
quantum zero knowledge

330
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,480
so we show the feasibility of uh bounded

331
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,000
concurrent um q z k for all languages in

332
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,240
np

333
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,320
so we strengthen this result to also

334
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,440
achieve

335
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,200
quantum proof of knowledge

336
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,959
so this is the standard notion of proof

337
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,440
of knowledge except that you're

338
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,839
arguing extraction against

339
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,440
quantum proverbs unbounded quantum

340
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,600
provers

341
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,120
and even this result we get for all

342
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,560
languages in np

343
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
and finally we get a feasibility of

344
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,720
bounded concurrent q zk for

345
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,760
all languages and qma

346
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,720
so qma is a quantum analog of n a

347
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,279
okay so if you're interested in

348
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,040
assumptions uh we get the first and

349
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
third results from uh post-quantum

350
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
one-way functions uh and we get the

351
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,560
quantum proof of knowledge for np from

352
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,239
quantum hardness of learning with ours

353
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,279
so in the remaining time i have uh i'm

354
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,639
going to just highlight the main

355
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,519
challenge that will come up in designing

356
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,440
in achieving feasibility of bonded

357
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,800
concurrent qck

358
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,560
um so in terms of the classical

359
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,839
rewinding strategies which is

360
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,720
the the backbone of uh simulation black

361
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,800
box simulation strategies

362
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,040
uh they do not carry over to the quantum

363
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,199
setting uh and there are two reasons to

364
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,079
it one reason is you know you cannot uh

365
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,000
copy the state um in a quantum state

366
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
and the second reason is what is called

367
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,399
as the state disturbance principle

368
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,680
so you need to

369
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,519
sort of simulate in a way where the very

370
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,639
fire state does not get disturbed

371
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,279
um so commonly adopted two-step approach

372
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,959
towards designing quantum zero knowledge

373
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,600
is to first identify classical rewinding

374
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,639
uh techniques that are quantum friendly

375
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,639
so these are techniques that possess

376
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,040
some additional properties

377
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
and the second step is to combine these

378
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,560
quantum friendly classical rewinding

379
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,040
strategies with waters rewinding lemma

380
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,160
to get quantum stimulation

381
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,320
and we are going to follow this approach

382
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,079
and it turns out that

383
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,079
if you follow this approach most known

384
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,839
classical component techniques are not

385
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,480
quantum friendly

386
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,560
um so what we do as part of this work is

387
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,480
to design a new quantum friendly

388
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,800
classical rewinding technique uh called

389
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,880
that we call this block rewinding

390
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,760
and

391
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,240
we show that uh the protocol of uh

392
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,560
passing and big strong is

393
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,079
bound bounded concurrent queue is okay

394
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,800
with respect to this technique

395
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,800
and that's it thanks

396
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,279
okay thanks a lot i'm done

397
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,040
uh let's move on to our next talk uh

398
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,760
about multi-theorem designated verifier

399
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,959
and this x for qma by omay shmueli

400
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,439
go ahead

401
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,680
thank you for the introduction here so

402
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,959
in the next

403
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,680
five minutes i'm gonna give a very

404
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,680
brief overview on this walk

405
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,560
so

406
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,600
um

407
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,800
ideally what we would like to achieve is

408
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,639
a real music for qma where a trusted

409
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,519
party samples this a common reference

410
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,959
string a classical string and then

411
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,079
any prover can give a non-interactive

412
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,040
proof

413
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,199
for any yes statement of the qma

414
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,639
language

415
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,639
now um for np we already know how to do

416
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,240
this under the learning without

417
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,320
assumptions and this is the work of

418
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,480
connecticut allen then by kirt and jihan

419
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,639
but um the state of things for qma is

420
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,040
very very very different

421
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,079
we don't have music for qma

422
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,079
like i defined in the previous slide

423
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,320
under any assumption

424
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,120
so um what we do know

425
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,519
in terms of physics for qma

426
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,560
i mean uh in which models of music do we

427
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,759
know how to construct um for qma so this

428
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,519
is the standard crs model but uh if we

429
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,399
move to the designated verifier model

430
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,240
where the trusted party also samples a

431
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,560
traptor secret verification key for the

432
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,240
verifier

433
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,519
then

434
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,120
in this relaxed setup

435
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,839
we do have um knees exfoliating we do

436
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,919
have designated verify

437
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,000
uh knees x for qma

438
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,720
and in this work um today we're going to

439
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,599
address two um issues with designated

440
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,079
verifier um for qma that we try to fix

441
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,919
the first is that

442
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,359
we don't have

443
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,640
prior work

444
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,199
don't achieve multi-theorem security or

445
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,080
also called reusability of the trusted

446
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,760
setup

447
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,000
more specifically we don't know how to

448
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,960
prove

449
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,480
that the previous protocol have

450
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,200
multi-program soundness that is even if

451
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,000
the

452
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,880
if a quantum polynomial time malicious

453
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,919
proverb

454
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,120
sees this setup it can

455
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,880
send repeatedly

456
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,360
proof to the verifier and each time

457
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,880
get the

458
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,039
the either rejection or acceptance bit

459
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,960
of the verifier

460
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,000
and then it can maybe after this process

461
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,919
break the soundness

462
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,919
of the system

463
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,919
so what we would like to do

464
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,480
first is to achieve a reusability of the

465
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,360
trusted setup this is um especially

466
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,080
relevant because if we think of the like

467
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,120
in the like the real world we don't have

468
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,160
a trusted party we implement the trusted

469
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,720
party usually if this is in the crs

470
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,760
model uh using a multi-party computation

471
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,080
which is interactive and if we need to

472
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,200
interact for every proof that we get

473
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,160
um

474
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
this is somewhat like and just an

475
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,919
interactive protocol so we would like to

476
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,640
interact once to generate the setup

477
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,160
and then have

478
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,360
an ezek from this point on

479
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,480
um the second problem with designated

480
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
verifier setups

481
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,080
is that um

482
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,480
the trusted party need to execute for

483
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,400
each new verifier that wants to join the

484
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,840
system

485
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,760
it needs to sample a new secret

486
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,720
verification key for each verifier that

487
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,320
wishes to join

488
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,720
and what we would like to

489
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,640
achieve is a setup where the trusted

490
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
party runs once

491
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,039
it generates this classical string that

492
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,520
everyone everybody can see in the sky

493
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,600
and then every verifier that wishes to

494
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
join it's going to sample by itself a

495
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,679
public and secret verification keys it's

496
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,039
going to publish the public key and

497
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,160
any approval can prove um

498
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,640
seeing the crs and the public

499
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,960
verification key of this specific

500
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,039
verifier this is called the malicious

501
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,280
addressing the verifier model

502
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,679
suggested first by a quattro plume and

503
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,120
weeks

504
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,240
so

505
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,480
naturally we would like to

506
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,520
have this setup and also keep

507
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,840
the reusability of the setup we will

508
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,120
define it next what exactly

509
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,400
we are going to get

510
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,240
so our results is that if we assume

511
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,039
um the standout polynomial hardness of

512
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,280
the learning videos assumption we can

513
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,919
construct a reusable malicious

514
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,919
designated verifier a non-interactive

515
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,640
zero knowledge protocol for qma

516
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,440
um

517
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,679
we also can assume some exponential

518
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,200
hardness of lwe to get the same

519
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,840
having also adaptive soundness

520
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,320
um and um the definition that we are

521
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,440
going to achieve is this we're going to

522
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,840
have uh the setup is the common random

523
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,039
string

524
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,520
um any verifier can simply public

525
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,039
clarification key

526
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,679
any prover seeing this key can give a

527
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,919
non-interactive proof this is going to

528
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,000
be reusable

529
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,440
which means

530
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,280
in terms of soundness

531
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,480
that this is a quantum polynomial time

532
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,720
prover it can repeatedly interact with a

533
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,200
verifier sending a proof and seeing the

534
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,919
acceptance rejection bit of the verifier

535
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,200
at the end it's going to send a

536
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,679
force instance with the fake proof

537
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,679
and the welfare is still going to reject

538
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,480
with overwhelming probability

539
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,679
um the multi theorem zero knowledge game

540
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,440
is going to be that

541
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,320
a quantum polynomial time distinguisher

542
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,039
is going to play against one of the

543
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,720
channels that it's going to try and

544
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,400
distinguish the first channel is the

545
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,840
approval channel

546
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,159
uh where each query of the distinguisher

547
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,159
to the prover contains the public

548
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,840
verification key that's possibly

549
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,880
malicious that's the point of it a yes

550
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,400
instance and a

551
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,840
witness both of them have to be legit

552
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,720
and um it's going to get the proof

553
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,520
and uh either the second channel is the

554
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,240
simulator challenges the the simulator

555
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,760
channel the stimulus is going to be a

556
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,159
quantum polynomial time algorithm it's

557
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,799
going to sample the cfs by itself

558
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,520
and or of course it's not going to have

559
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,440
access to the witness the

560
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,840
distinguishable sense

561
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,280
and these channels are going to be

562
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,880
indistinguishable for the distinguisher

563
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,679
so

564
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,880
just a quick few words on like the main

565
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,280
challenge that we um deal with in the

566
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,799
construction

567
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,760
so what we like to do is to compile a

568
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,159
quantum sigma protocol

569
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,280
um

570
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,880
for qma

571
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,919
into a

572
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,880
multi-theorem mdv nizik

573
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,240
system

574
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,360
and in a sigma protocol for qma alpha

575
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,840
and gamma both are possibly quantum

576
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,960
and when we think about the techniques

577
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,760
for constructing musics for np usually

578
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,520
all of them

579
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,240
require that alpha be a classical string

580
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,520
in particular

581
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,679
if you think about a theater for example

582
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,960
you take you think of alpha for a moment

583
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,880
just as a classical string you apply a

584
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,120
random function to alpha and this is how

585
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,840
the prover generates

586
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,520
beta and we're going to use the fact

587
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,080
that we already have music for np to

588
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
just keep alpha untouched in the

589
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,919
construction

590
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,799
um and more specifically we're going to

591
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,520
just give a classical technique there

592
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,840
isn't really much quantum in the

593
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,200
construction

594
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,080
um that just compiles well to the

595
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,159
quantum setting

596
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,039
and the tools that we're going to use

597
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,320
accept sigma protocols for qma

598
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,880
non-interactive zeros protocol for np

599
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,559
we're going to use a public encryption

600
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,200
with specific property and also full

601
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,960
homomorphic encryption

602
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,600
with circuit privacy

603
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,880
and you can see the full construction

604
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,480
and everything else in the full talk uh

605
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,120
thank you very much

606
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,240
okay uh thanks a lot

607
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,120
um

608
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,559
so let's move on now to the next talk um

609
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,080
on the round complexity of secure

610
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,760
quantum computation

611
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,320
uh by james bottusek andrea cola

612
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,320
d'angelo takshita kuana and fermima

613
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
and james will be

614
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,279
giving the talk yes thank you

615
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,840
so so right i'll be discussing this uh

616
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
work about run complexity of secure

617
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,440
quantum computation

618
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,760
with andrea dakshita and fermi

619
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,720
so

620
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,840
um

621
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,200
yeah this notion

622
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,880
this paper is about multi-party quantum

623
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
computation which is like asking for

624
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,400
example

625
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,559
uh can we securely compute over

626
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,440
distributed private quantum databases

627
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,679
um maybe a more specific application to

628
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,000
have in mind is can we thresholdize

629
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
crypto that uses quantum information

630
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,039
like generating quantum money generating

631
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,039
uh encryption or signature schemes with

632
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,360
unclonable keys and so on

633
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,080
um but more formally this notion is just

634
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,880
a uh just a generalization of the very

635
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,360
well-studied notion of classical npc

636
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,000
uh to a setting where we allow

637
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,840
um you know quantum parties with

638
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,600
potentially quantum inputs

639
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,520
uh that want to compute a quantum

640
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,600
functionality and in general these

641
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,200
inputs and outputs could could be

642
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,799
entangled

643
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,960
um and so they're going to do this by

644
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,880
communicating uh you know actually

645
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,480
sending uh quantum states to each other

646
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,039
and security is uh the same as classical

647
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,520
npc right so we consider an adversary

648
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,919
corrupting some subset of parties

649
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,679
and they shouldn't learn anything about

650
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,440
the honest party inputs other than what

651
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,360
they would anyways learn from the output

652
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,760
of the functionality okay

653
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,880
and so

654
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,960
of course this notion uh has not been as

655
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,720
well studied as well studied as

656
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,120
classical npc but uh a few works have

657
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,200
studied it so in particular

658
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,840
um these were uh constructed information

659
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,520
theoretically secure protocols in the

660
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,559
honest majority setting

661
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,480
later on the dishonest majority setting

662
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,000
was studied and these works showed that

663
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,320
actually secure

664
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,960
classical npc implies secure quantum mpc

665
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,760
okay

666
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,279
so these are all

667
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,799
really nice feasibility results

668
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,080
establishing that

669
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,120
secure

670
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,480
mpqc

671
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,799
exists

672
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,400
but the starting point for our work is

673
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,080
just is noting that like all of these

674
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,200
protocols

675
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,360
are highly interactive and in particular

676
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,279
like the number of uh rounds of

677
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,760
communication grows um with the depth of

678
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,360
the even the quantum circuit being

679
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,600
evaluated um along with a number of

680
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,080
parties and security parameter uh so

681
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,440
given this

682
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,840
uh we study uh the notion of round

683
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,000
efficient secure quantum computation i

684
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,919
think we're the first work to study this

685
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,520
along with actually concurrent work that

686
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,000
we'll hear from in the next session

687
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,200
um and to be uh more specific about our

688
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,559
setting we consider the dishonest

689
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,559
majority setting um

690
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,080
and we aim for security against

691
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,080
malicious adversaries okay and we're

692
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
going to assume some common

693
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,200
random strings sierra set up

694
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,159
so

695
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,640
we have results in both the tea party

696
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,200
and multi-party setting um

697
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,279
the two-party setting uh

698
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,080
classically like a

699
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,919
foundational result going back to the

700
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,919
80s is that if we assume

701
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,320
uh just two message oblivious transfer

702
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,400
so this very simple functionality

703
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,720
this actually implies the

704
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,080
ability to

705
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,640
compute any classical functionality

706
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,480
uh over these two parties inputs in just

707
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
two messages if that functioning only

708
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,600
delivers output to two one to one party

709
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,360
and so in the malicious setting such a

710
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,600
such a two message protocol is uh has

711
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,120
been called a nisk or a non-attractive

712
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,600
secure computation protocol

713
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,520
and our first result is just a quantum

714
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,120
analog of this okay so like a

715
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,039
quantumnisk protocol we show that

716
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,520
assuming uh post quantum to message ot

717
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,200
then any quantum functionality that

718
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,279
delivers output to one party uh can be

719
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,440
securely computed in two messages

720
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,360
okay so a quantum misc

721
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,240
um

722
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,000
a main technical tool we use is a so um

723
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,600
quantum garbled circuits has been

724
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
introduced recently by uh brocarski and

725
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,360
uen and we use a notion of quantum

726
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,640
garbling

727
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,480
that has a completely classical circle

728
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
circuit garbling procedure

729
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,000
although the input garbling procedure

730
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,360
can be quantum but this is kind of the

731
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,399
main technical tool we we start with and

732
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,159
we show how to compile this into a

733
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,720
quantum disk okay

734
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,520
so

735
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,000
so a next natural question is okay so

736
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,399
what if both parties uh are want to

737
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,080
output right then niska is just in the

738
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,840
case where one party gets output and

739
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,120
what if we still want to do this in a

740
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,399
round optimal way so namely two rounds

741
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,320
um there's a pretty there's a reasonable

742
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,080
classical approach to doing this given a

743
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,559
nisk uh so you take your functionality

744
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,320
with two outputs now and split it up

745
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,919
into these two separate functionalities

746
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,159
one that delivers output to uh party a

747
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,240
and one that delivers output to party b

748
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,679
and now if you have a nisk you can kind

749
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,240
of just run these uh two functionalities

750
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,039
in parallel using your nisk okay

751
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,559
um so this is a natural approach that

752
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,919
can be made to work in the classical

753
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,320
setting uh that runs into some pretty

754
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,240
big difficulties in the quantum setting

755
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,960
so

756
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,600
uh first if these if these inputs are

757
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,760
quantum this seems to require cloning

758
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,520
them which in general may not be

759
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,799
possible

760
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,120
kind of even worse if this functionality

761
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,200
is randomized then in order to ensure

762
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,640
that these outputs are like properly

763
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,880
jointly distributed uh what you have to

764
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,480
do is kind of like fix a random string

765
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,720
the same random string to use in both uh

766
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,799
parallel protocols right

767
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,799
and this is really not possible in the

768
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,399
quantum setting because like randomness

769
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,399
can actually come from from measurement

770
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,600
okay

771
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,399
so

772
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,240
um this is just to highlight some

773
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,799
challenges uh in extending our nisk to

774
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,440
like a a protocol with with two where

775
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,200
both parties get output

776
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,279
um and our next result is studying the

777
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,440
setting of two round two pqc and we we

778
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,360
show how to construct it in a couple

779
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,919
relaxed settings okay so first if we

780
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,559
assume that there is some the parties

781
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,840
are allowed some input independent

782
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,120
pre-processing

783
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,799
like maybe you know one party sends a

784
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,159
message to another party that doesn't

785
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,320
depend on their input after this point

786
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,480
we can just do a two-round protocol

787
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,960
assuming sub-exponential lwe

788
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
uh the other relaxed small model we

789
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
consider is that we show that this this

790
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,360
t-round 2pqc does exist but with respect

791
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,440
to a quantum oracle or so obfuscation of

792
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,559
quantum functionalities which is uh

793
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,120
really like a proof-of-concept result

794
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,360
um since we at this point have no really

795
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,039
heuristic way to instantiate such an

796
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,000
oracle

797
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,520
and kind of interesting open problem

798
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,600
that remains is really does does round

799
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,559
optimal

800
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,240
two-party quantum computation exist in

801
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,039
the crs model okay

802
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,640
um

803
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
so yeah i'll just briefly say what

804
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,000
results we have in the multi-party

805
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,600
setting and here the additional

806
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,120
challenge uh if you want to constant

807
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,880
round protocols to remove the round

808
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,120
dependence on the number of parties

809
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,200
and um this is made a little bit more

810
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,120
difficult in the quantum setting uh

811
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,880
because you can't really broadcast

812
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,159
quantum information you can't send

813
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,399
broadcast information simultaneously to

814
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,159
all parties in your protocol

815
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,000
um but nevertheless we show that indeed

816
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,279
you can obtain constant round mpqc

817
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,200
in particular five rounds i'm assuming

818
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,120
to message ot and we also have a result

819
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,799
in the pre-processing setting again if

820
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,480
we allow the parties to communicate

821
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,960
before they receive their inputs

822
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,399
then once they receive their inputs they

823
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,039
can just get away with two more rounds

824
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,880
okay so

825
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,000
this is

826
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,840
all i wanted to say and i'm

827
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,360
thanks for listening happy to take

828
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,840
questions

829
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,840
okay um thanks a lot james and thank you

830
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,960
all the speakers uh so far uh so we have

831
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
almost uh 10 minutes

832
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,480
for questions

833
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,799
um so what we're going to do is that

834
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,480
like if you want to raise your hand and

835
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,159
just ask in person

836
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,279
that is great um if not i'll check the

837
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,679
the zulip um

838
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,600
does anyone want to ask a question in

839
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,200
person

840
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,559
uh can i

841
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,880
i yeah i'm going to use the hand trace

842
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,000
handful

843
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,559
that's good enough go ahead yeah um so

844
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,640
this is the question for james um

845
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,120
so it's a very nice talk by the way uh

846
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,440
regarding your our last result on um mpc

847
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,679
is it what what security model are you

848
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,840
considering is it specus or

849
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,279
malicious

850
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,600
oh that is malicious yeah

851
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,320
so but even for malicious security uh

852
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,399
you would need at least four rounds

853
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,240
right so how are you building

854
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,159
uh we're in the crs model

855
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,720
oh so when you say two round o t it's uh

856
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,919
two round routine this year yes

857
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,519
everything everything is in a serious

858
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,519
model everything is malicious in this

859
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,880
paper yeah okay thank you

860
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,840
yeah actually go ahead

861
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,399
yeah uh my question is for naive

862
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,039
so are there any fundamental barriers to

863
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,640
achieving four round epsilon zk

864
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
so you i think your protocol is five

865
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,799
rounds right

866
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,240
uh yes

867
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,960
i think to true forum probably we need

868
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,840
um

869
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,080
it's credible commitment when possible

870
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,240
there is tractable commitment

871
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,880
so for the platform uh we need the

872
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,960
additional wrong it's because that we

873
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,720
need a collapsing hashing function

874
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,600
in the beginning so

875
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,519
yeah i think this is one direction we

876
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,360
are trying to

877
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
we are thinking but yeah we haven't had

878
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,120
a very good answer like how to achieve

879
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,960
forward yeah but

880
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
there's a gap between three one and five

881
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,080
wrong so

882
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,279
yeah that's one very good question yeah

883
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,600
thanks

884
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,960
anyone else

885
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,200
you're like you're allowed to ask twice

886
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,159
uh

887
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,480
i know you had a question uh tonight we

888
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,039
as well so uh you're welcome to ask

889
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,039
yeah um so

890
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,360
uh nicely what is the difference between

891
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,760
the rewinding technique you use versus

892
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,880
unrules rewinding technique conceptually

893
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,200
they seem to be similar in the sense

894
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,320
that um even andrew um sort of devises a

895
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,240
method where you know the adversary

896
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,000
needs to come into something

897
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,600
and

898
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,039
the message is sort of information

899
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,279
theoretically determined so even if you

900
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,720
measure you're not really disturbing the

901
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
state and then you go back right

902
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,240
um so is it is the difference in the

903
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,480
analysis or is just difference in the

904
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,960
way you're extracting

905
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,919
yeah because i'm not familiar with

906
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,839
onlook techniques so

907
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,839
i'm i don't know how but for our

908
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,000
techniques which is that uh we use

909
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,679
watchers rewinding but we um but because

910
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,760
when you do the commitment the verified

911
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,599
dual commitment you can you cannot do a

912
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,159
strict binding if you want the street

913
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,839
hiding so the statistic hiding property

914
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,159
right so if you can lead to completion

915
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,399
hiding or collapsing binding

916
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,000
then um when you do a virtual 310 is

917
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
when you do another you need to be very

918
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,239
careful about like how to extract the

919
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,320
commitment how he is trying to challenge

920
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,239
your say yeah the challenge out from the

921
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,679
commitment

922
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,440
yeah so so you're using borders

923
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
rewinding to combine the non-abort and

924
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,280
abort are you also using wordpress

925
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,399
rewinding for the nominal part for both

926
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,399
like we use the wanted wiring to combine

927
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,079
a board and onboard and then we also use

928
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,400
what we're doing for our port uh you

929
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,040
need to combine it with the uh either

930
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,839
the

931
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,000
collapsing hiding quality binding

932
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,760
commitment or later you need to use the

933
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,040
wi

934
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,279
uh pok for that yeah

935
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,880
thanks

936
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,480
thanks

937
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,960
um any other questions in in person

938
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,200
okay so maybe uh let me check out the

939
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,880
uh this is the loop

940
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,040
oh i see uh that daniel

941
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,280
has a question uh to james um

942
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,000
so

943
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,720
um basically the question is uh james

944
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,640
any any chance to get a information

945
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,880
theoretic security

946
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,599
uh

947
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,119
in the setting like what do we know

948
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,640
about that

949
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,480
in constant rounds so that there are

950
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,079
works that show information theoretic

951
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,480
security in the honest majority setting

952
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,040
um and they

953
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,880
yeah they they're they're not constant

954
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,320
rounds um i'm not sure if if a question

955
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,599
was specifically about constant rounds

956
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,200
but like certainly information theoretic

957
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,800
protocols exist

958
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,240
um and i have not really thought about

959
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,599
optimizing round complexity in that

960
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,640
setting

961
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,240
is there any barrier to getting them

962
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,800
liking constant rounds

963
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,170
um

964
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,240
[Music]

965
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,359
yeah not that i'm aware of

966
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,359
okay thanks james i'll ask a follow-up

967
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,720
question so

968
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,400
all that the results that you mentioned

969
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,359
are in the crs model right yes

970
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,880
and like

971
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,520
can we hope to remove it like uh what do

972
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,040
we need

973
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,880
so there is okay so i have a paper with

974
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,720
some others at

975
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,359
eurocrypt that that studies um

976
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,079
the notion of like post quantum mpc in

977
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,920
constant rounds and so you could you

978
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,680
could use that to instantiate the crs

979
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,280
and get everything and you'd get a

980
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,960
constant round protocol for for all of

981
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,760
our results uh additionally assuming um

982
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,320
fhe so you need circular security to get

983
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,000
this done okay so you could sort of

984
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,160
generically compile it adding a few more

985
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,960
rounds in the beginning

986
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,119
got it cool okay

987
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,240
um

988
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,240
any other questions uh anyone

989
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,280
let me see if there's uh

990
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,480
anything else in the

991
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,598
in the zoolope

992
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,320
um

993
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,280
okay

994
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,599
yeah so i don't maybe i missed anything

995
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,880
but so any other questions

996
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,520
making sure i didn't miss anyone

997
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,839
okay great um yeah you know this is

998
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,560
live and uh speakers can check out also

999
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,359
the

1000
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,160
questions later on and answer so if you

1001
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,079
think about something you forgot to ask

1002
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,599
just go ahead and

1003
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,079
they might just answer it later

1004
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,359
so we have a mini break now and we'll

1005
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,280
resume in about

1006
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,839
12

1007
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:08,000
minutes yes so feel free to
